Manchester United star, Anthony Martial has admitted he must prove himself as a striker if he is to rank among the best in the league. Signed in 2015, Martial has struggled to hit the heights expected of him. He has been used in a more central role for his side this season, leading the line in United’s attack, and feels now is the time for him to show what he can do. “When I arrived at the club, I was just a young player,” Martial told the official Man Utd website. “I still hadn’t had the benefit of a proper full season as a professional first-team player in my legs. “But now it’s my fifth season here, so now I have to prove and to show that I have evolved as a player and blossomed into one of the best strikers in the Premier League. “When I came here I was still just a kid, and now I’ve grown up and I’ve become a lot more mature. Nowadays, I feel so much better in myself.” Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has placed more faith in the Frenchman, pairing him with Marcus Rashford and Daniel James this season, which has seen him return five goals in 12 appearances. Martial said of Rashford: “For me, Marcus is quite a complete player. He is young but he’s a guy with a lot of experience because he started out so young. Speaking about James, he added, “He really is a top player and someone I wasn’t aware of before, so quite honestly, that makes him a great addition.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
