Barcelona ace, Lionel Messi has insisted that he is approaching his retirement from football after winning his sixth Ballon D’ Or on Monday night in France. Messi, who won the 2019 Ballon D’Or ahead of Juventus’ Cristiano Ronaldo and Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk, admitted that “Time flies” but hoped God will grant him the strength to continue playing football for many more years. Messi’s current deal at Barcelona will end in 2021. The Argentine captain will turn 33 years at the end of the season. “I’m aware of how old I am,” ESPN quoted Messi as saying after winning his sixth Ballon d’Or on Monday. “And I enjoy these moments so much because I know that retirement is approaching. Time flies.” Messi added: “I hope, God willing, that I keep playing for many more years. “I’m now 32, though, and will be 33 at the end of the season, so, as I said, everything depends on how I feel physically. “Right now I feel better than ever on a physical and a personal level, and I hope I can go on for a lot longer.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
