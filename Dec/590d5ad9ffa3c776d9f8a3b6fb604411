Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has aimed a sly dig at former boss, Jose Mourinho, and how he handled Kevin De Bruyne, Mohamed Salah and Romelu Lukaku. De Bruyne, Salah and Lukaku all used to ply their trade at Stamford Bridge. But they have become superstars away from West London. Lampard is eager to ensure that there is no repeat of that situation during his tenure and vowed to show patience with young players. “If we’re not patient and we don’t stick with the players then you might be in a situation where we have been before, where top world-class players have been at Chelsea when they were 20 or 21, but the managers maybe didn’t stick with them so much then. “I’m in a position where I’m going to stick with them,” he told a press conference on Tuesday. Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount, Fikayo Tomori and Reece James are among the youngsters to have seen regular game time this season, with that quartet flourishing on a Premier League stage, after spending time on loan in the second tier last season.
