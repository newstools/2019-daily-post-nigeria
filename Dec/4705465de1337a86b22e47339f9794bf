The coast is now clear for the All Progressives Congress,APC, to conduct its Ward Local Government and State Congresses in Rivers State. This is because a High Court sitting in Port Harcourt has struck out the originating summons brought by one Ibrahim Umar and twenty-two others against the APC. The court also set aside the interim injunction obtained by the claimants on the 14th September, 2019 which stopped the APC from conducting the congresses in Rivers State scheduled for 17th, 18th and 21st of last September. Delivering the judgment, presiding Judge, Justice G.O Ollor ruled that the court lacked the power to enforce and interpret the judgment of the court of coordinate jurisdiction. Justice Ollor also held that the interim order of injunction obtained by Ibrahim Umar and others was gotten without jurisdiction of the court and thereby set aside the order and thereafter awarded one hundred thousand Naira as cost in favour of the APC. Speaking to newsman outside the court, counsel to the Claimants, Henry Bello described the judgment as the beauty of justice but disclosed that he will appeal the judgment based on the instruction of his clients. On his path, one of the counsels to APC, Jerome Williams, described the judgment as a landmark which has given the APC the opportunity to go ahead to conduct its congresses in Rivers State. Recall that one Ibrahim Umar and 22 others including two dead persons had upon the announcement by the APC on new dates for Congresses approached the court to enforce and interpret the judgment of the High court, Appeal and Supreme Court against APC over the congresses that stalled the party’s fortunes in 2019.
