The newly-elected Senator for Kogi West, Smart Adeyemi has explained why he defeated Dino Melaye at the rerun Senatorial election. Adeyemi said he won the election because Kogi people needed a change from having a senator like Dino representing them. He added that Dino Melaye was defeated in the just concluded rerun election because he did nothing for Kogi residents rather than enrich himself with cars. Speaking on Channels Tv, Adeyemi said:“I won the election based on the conviction of the Nigerian people, people of my senatorial district, and the people of my state that the time had come for them to effect a change. “Dino did nothing since he has been there, rather than buying cars and showing to the Nigerian people. “Dino has never worked anywhere before, he was on the street, how can he claim to have been in politics before me “I am sure that no Nigerian would want to have somebody like Dino as a Senator. May Nigeria never have the kind of Dino as a Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
