Arsenal head coach, Mikel Arteta, has said Chelsea midfielder Jorginho should have been sent off, before his goal against Arsenal . Substitute Jorginho was booked in the 55th minute, when he wrestled Alexandre Lacazette to the ground. The Italy international then cynically took Mateo Guendouzi down from behind, to stop a quick Gunners attack. Lacazette, who was furious with referee Craig Pawson for failing to send Jorginho off, instead got a yellow. Jorginho went ahead to make it 1-1, after Gunners keeper Bernd Leno flapping at the cross. Arteta was unequivocal when asked whether Jorginho should have been on the pitch to net. “I think that is up to you guys to decide,” he told reporters. “For me it is very clear.” Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, added: “It certainly could have been a second yellow but I don’t think it was clear cut.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
