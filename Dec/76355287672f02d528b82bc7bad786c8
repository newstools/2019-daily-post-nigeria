More than 1,000 members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and other political parties have defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Wakama ward of Nasarawa State. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the defectors included former elected councillors as well as PDP ward chairmen and secretaries. The state APC Treasurer, Mr Mohammed Aya, who received the defectors at a formal ceremony on Sunday at Wakama, said the party was encouraged with their decision to join the ruling party.
The treasurer who represented Mr Philip Shakwo, the APC State Chairman, assured the newcomers that they have equal rights and privileges like the old members. He therefore assured that government would site projects that would impact on the lives of the people of the community to justify the action of the defectors. Similarly, Mr Silas Agara, the immediate past deputy governor of the state, said now that the people of the community decided to join the party in government, more development would come to the area. He noted that it is only the government that is capable of bringing development hence the need for them to join the government if they are in politics for development. Speaking on behalf of the defectors, Mr Bala John, said they have decided to join APC due to the developmental strides of the party at both state and national levels. He expressed gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari for constructing roads in the community. “Wakama community is the only community in the state that the federal government is currently constructing over 6kms of road. He therefore pledged their unalloyed support to the APC government at all levels and appealed to them to site more development projects in the area.
