The Northern Governors Forum on Monday condemned the alleged execution of four aid workers by Boko Haram terrorists in North-Eastern Nigeria. The Governors decried the heinous act, describing it as “regrettable and a conduct that will not go unpunished.” Chairman of the Forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, through his Director of Press and Public Affairs, Dr Makut Simon Macham, said he was saddened by the development which is not only “condemnable, but a crime against humanity and good conscience”. Lalong commiserated with the families and loved ones of the aid workers for the “anguish” which befell them simply because their relatives offered themselves to serve humanity and help those in need. DAILYPOST recalls that the aid workers were reportedly abducted near Damasak, Borno State, in July, 2019, and had been in captivity despite all efforts to secure their release and freedom until their alleged execution. Lalong reiterates that, “As Northern Governors, we are determined to continue working with the Federal Government, Security Agencies, the Citizens and all stakeholders in overcoming this evil that is perpetrated by criminally minded persons. The NGF Chairman urged aid workers and those offering essential services to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and other needy people in the North-East and other areas not to be deterred by this set back which cannot be allowed to rubbish the sacrifices and good work that has been put into the fight against insurgency.
