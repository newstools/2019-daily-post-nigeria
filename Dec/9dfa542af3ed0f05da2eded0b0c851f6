Manchester United goalkeeper, David De Gea, on Sunday, made history in his side’s 1-1 draw with Everton at Old Trafford. Victor Lindelof’s own goal and Mason Greewood’s strike ensure Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men played a draw against the Toffees. According to OptaJoe, De Gea has now conceded at least once in all of his last 12 Premier League outings for the Red Devils after the draw against Everton. It is the longest run without a clean sheet in the Spain international’s career in the English top-flight league. De Gea will now hope to lead Man United to victory when they take on Watford in their next Premier League fixture on December 22.
