Wale Ajayi. Describing the donations as a good development, Oladebeye noted that the gesture will go a long way in complementing the efforts of the government in making the institution ranked best in technical education in the country. “I am elated with the donations, simply because not all politicians will want to do this, it is not common among the politicians. This is the second of its type since I became Rector. “Technical education is key to the survival of any economy, especially a developing one and all hands must be on the deck to promote it to rescue us from this messy unemployment and insecurity situation. “The donor is a good ambassador of this institution. You have brought honour to us, we will continue to support the administration of Dr. Fayemi and ensure its success “.

He applauded the management of the institution for the opportunity given him to serve in the institution, noting that the knowledge he gained while lecturing really manifested in his political career. He said the donation was part of his contribution towards the development of the institution and to pay back to the polytechnic community that had given him enough knowledge .
