A 20-year-old man, Hassan Buba of Girei Local Government Area of Adamawa State has been arrested allegedly for raping a 55-year-old woman. The Police Public Relations Officer of the state, DSP Sulaiman Nguroje, who disclosed this to DAILY POST on Tuesday, said Hassan Buba got at the woman by pretending to be a good boy. “The woman, who was carrying a luggage, was deceived by the boy who offered to help her. She let him have the luggage and she tagged along with him until they got to a secluded place where the boy overpowered her and had his way with her,” the police PRO explained. He said three other suspects were also in police custody on rape charges, including another extreme case of a 79-year-old man who defiled a 12-year-old girl, and a 22-year-old man suspected to have raped a teenage girl. He said the 79-year-old, Vandi Pate of Michika in Michika LGA of the state, seized a 12-year-old girl as she headed to a farm and then had forced carnal knowledge of her. According to Nguroje, preliminary investigations had revealed that Vandi might be a serial rapist as this is not the first time the young man would be caught in such an act. Nguroje also named one Mubarak Ishaya, 22, a resident of Jimeta in Yola North LGA, of being held for the rape of a 14-year-old girl. He said investigations were being rounded up on these cases and the suspects would be charged to court accordingly. Rape has been a raging issue around Adamawa State in recent times, with the gang-rape of a 15-year-old girl in Jimeta around the weekend still fresh in mind.
