Barcelona’s top striker, Luis Suarez, has informed the club board to sign a new young or an established number 9 player as his replacement at Camp Nou. Suarez, who will turn 33 in January 2020, is in the latter stages of his career at Barcelona. The Uruguay international joined Barcelona from Liverpool in 2014. He has scored 187 goals and provided 99 assists in 263 appearances for the Catalan club so far. But Suarez at 32 years of age is a shadow of his former self. Speaking ahead of his side’s home La Liga clash against Mallorca on Saturday night, Suarez told belN Sports: “If Barcelona bring in a new team-mate for me to compete with, that’s the same pressure as having to play every three days. “And I have to be thinking about the future of the club, as a fan of the club, I have to think about the future. “And maybe the best thing is if Barcelona sign a young or an established player to carry the torch as Barcelona’s number 9.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
