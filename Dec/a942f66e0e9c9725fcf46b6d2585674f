A Joint Special Taskforce, comprising Officers and Men of Ogun I Command, Federal Operation Unit Zone “A” and CGC’s Strike Force had intercepted 13 fuel jerry cans of 25 litres and six jerry cans of 10 litres concealed in two caskets. This was contained in a statement signed by Ogun 1 Command Customs Spokesperson, Abdullahi Maiwada on Wednesday evening. Maiwada said the items were conveyed by a “daredevil” smuggler with the intention of smuggling the items across the border to a neighbouring country in a Mazda 626 with Lagos registration number: LSD 617 CW. “To this end, the command wishes to reiterate its stand that there is no retreat on the fight against smuggling in whatever disguise. “We, therefore, appeal to the general public to embrace legitimate means of livelihood and to avoid smuggling in all its ramifications. The eagle eye is all around Ogun State to halt new techniques initiated by economic saboteurs to perpetuate their illicit acts,” Maiwada said.
