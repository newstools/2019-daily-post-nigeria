World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has issued Russia a four-year ban from international sporting competition over doping failures. The World Anti-Doping Agency’s board made the announcement after they convened on Monday for a meeting around the International Olympic Committee’s headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. The agency disclosed that Russia planted fake evidence and deleted files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify drug cheats. WADA President, Sir Craig Reedie said the decision has showed its “determination to act resolutely in the face of the Russian doping crisis”. “For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport. The blatant breach by the Russian authorities of Rusada’s reinstatement conditions demanded a robust response. “That is exactly what has been delivered. “Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and re-join the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial,” he added. Reacting, Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev said the ban was part of “chronic anti-Russian hysteria.” “It is obvious that significant doping problems still exist in Russia, I mean our sporting community. This is impossible to deny. “But on the other hand the fact that all these decisions are repeated, often affecting athletes who have already been punished in one way or another, not to mention some other points – of course, this makes one think that this is part of anti-Russian hysteria which has become chronic,” he said.
