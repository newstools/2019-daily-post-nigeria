Shehu Sani, former Kaduna Central Senator, has described the immediate order by the Federal Government for the release of former National Security Adviser (NSA), Sambo Dasuki and convener of #RevolutionNow, Omoyele Sowore, as a “welcome development.’’ In a statement released on Tuesday, the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, ordered the release of Dasuki and convener of #RevolutionNow, Omoyele Sowore. This is coming few weeks after Malami took over the case of Sowore from DSS. The decision to release Sowore and his co-accused was in compliance with the bail granted the two by the court. Dasuki’s lawyer in a terse statement, also commended President Muhammadu Buhari and the AGF for the decision. But, Sani in his reaction, called on Buhari government to extend its decision to other Nigerians in detention. On his Twitter page, Sani wrote: “Freedom for Dasuki and Sowore in compliance with the Court orders is a welcome Development. “And that should be extended to others in same condition.” Recall that IMN leader, Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky has been in detention since December 2015 after the Nigerian Army’s onslaught on his members that led to the Zaria massacre. Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, had days ago said the IMN leader, Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky, is being held in detention for crimes and not his Islamic belief.
