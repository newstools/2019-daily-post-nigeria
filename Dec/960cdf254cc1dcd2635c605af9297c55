Villarreal winger, Samuel Chukwueze, has named former Chelsea winger, Arjen Robben, as his role model. Chukwueze has already netted in all the competitions he has featured in for his Spanish club this season, including La Liga, Copa del Rey and Europa League. In an interview with the Super Eagles Media team, said: “Arjen Robben. He is the perfect match, I always watch his video if I am going to play a game or when I am alone in the room, when I have free time I watch his game also.” On his best friend in the Nigeria national team, he said: “Victor Osimhen. Five or six years now we have been together, from U17 to U20, U23, Super Eagles and we keep in touch always, and he’s doing perfectly good in his club. “I think we have been so good, he’s just very lively to be with.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
