Arsenal interim manager, Freddie Ljungberg, has opened up on dressing room talks with senior officials at the club, after their win over West Ham. The Gunners came from behind to defeat the Hammers 3-1 at the London Stadium on Monday night. It was Ljungberg’s first win since taking over from Unai Emery. Speaking at a press conference ahead of their Europa League clash with Standard Liege, Ljungberg revealed Edu and Raul Sanllehi visited him in the dressing room immediately after the game. “Everybody was in the dressing room after the game except the owner. “They were very happy with the result and the victory,” he said. Ljungberg however insisted he has not held discussions over taking the job on a permanent basis. “It’s not a conversation I’ve had with the bosses. “My job is to go from day to day, game to game, to try to help this fantastic club. That’s what I try to do. All of those decisions are up to the top dogs. “What the club decides to do, or who they choose, it is totally up to them but I stay totally out of it,” he added.
