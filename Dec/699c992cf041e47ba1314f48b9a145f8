Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has hailed defenders, Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof following his side’s Premier League 2-0 win over Burnley on Saturday. According to Solskjaer, both Maguire and Lindelof were ‘brilliant and stood up’ against two real handfuls of strikers, Chris Wood and Ashley Barnes. Solskjaer’s men defeated Burnley at Turf Moor, thanks to two goals from Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford. Speaking to MUTV after the match, Solskjaer said: “I think, in the first half, we laid the foundation. We could go in and defend in the second half – and the defending was brilliant. Harry [Maguire] and Victor [Lindelof] were brilliant and stood up against two real handfuls of strikers. Chris Wood and Ashley Barnes. I wouldn’t like to be a centre-back playing against them! ”The full-backs were really, really aggressive in stopping crosses and, when the crosses came in, Harry and Victor were unbelievable. Harry had a couple of headers near the end that gives us the points. At 1-0, we defend and then we get the second one. We should have got it earlier but, finally, we got it. David [De Gea] is delighted with the clean sheet and the back four is as well.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
