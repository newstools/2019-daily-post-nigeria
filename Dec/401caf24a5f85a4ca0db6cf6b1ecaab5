The lawmaker representing Egbeda/Ona Ara Federal Constituency, Akin Alabi has reacted to the arrest of Shina Peller, owner of Quilox nigh club. DAILY POST had reported that the police in Lagos State had arrested and detained Peller, a member of the House of Representatives, at the Moroko Police Station. Peller, who is representing Iseyin/Itesiwaju/Kajola/Iwajowa Federal Constituency, Oyo State, was allegedly arrested while trying to take the bail of some clubbers. However, Alabi said the arrest of Peller was an indication that police brutality “knows no status.” In a series of tweets, Alabi wrote: “So founder of Quilox and House of Representatives member, @ShinaPeller went to bail his customers that were illegally arrested… then the Police at Maroko police station detained him as well. Police brutality knows no status. “We are on our way to Panti. First of all, the cars of the customers were towed and seized for violating traffic. FINE. “But they were arrested and told to pay N100,000 bribe. Why one earth do you need to pay the police a bribe after your car has already been seized.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
