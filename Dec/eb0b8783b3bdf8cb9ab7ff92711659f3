Speaking to talkSPORT after the game, the former Manchester City assistant manager said he is pleased with his players. “As I said on many occasions, I am pleased with a lot of the things I have seen today,” he said. “In terms of the attitude and the commitment and the passion that the players played with. “The effort they put in was terrific and I didn’t expect it to hold for 90 minutes.
