Arsenal will be without up to six players, when they take on Standard Liege in the Europa League on Thursday, SportsMail reports. Left-back Kieran Tierney could be out for up to three months, after he suffered a dislocated shoulder in Monday’s 3-1 win at West Ham. The win against the Hammers, saw the Gunners end a nine-match run without a victory, but a number of players suffered knocks. Hector Bellerin was withdrawn from the line-up ahead of kick-off with a tight hamstring and will not travel to Belgium. Granit Xhaka suffered concussion during the game at the London Stadium and will miss the next two fixtures. Club-record signing Nicolas Pepe also suffered a bruised knee, which means he could miss Sunday’s game against Manchester City, having already been ruled out of the Liege clash. Dani Ceballos remains sidelined with a hamstring issue and Arsenal also confirmed Rob Holding would be absent for around two weeks as he recovers from a minor knee complaint.
