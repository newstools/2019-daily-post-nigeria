The Ogun State Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) on Friday said three persons died while one person sustained injuries in an accident involving a truck and a Bajaj motorcycle around Toll-Gate on Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway. Mr Clement Oladele, Sector Commander of FRSC, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ota,Ogun, that the accident happened at about 12.59 p.m. on Thursday. According to Oladele the truck with registration number, KRD 72 XY, had a brake failure and rammed into the Bajaj motorcycle, marked AKM039 UP, conveying two female passengers who were just disembarking from the bike. The sector commander said that five persons, comprising 3 male adults and two female adults, were involved in the accident.
According to him, a passerby died instantly while a female passenger later died after getting to the General Hospital, Ota. “The corpse of the victims have been deposited at the General Hospital, Ifo, and the only survivor was receiving treatment at General Hospital, Ota,” he said. The FRSC boss also said that the sum of N72,930 recovered from the scene of the accident have been handed over to the victims relations. Oladele commiserated with the families of the victims and prayed the Lord to grant them the fortitude to bear the losses. He, however, warned motorists to drive cautiously with absolute concentration and give consideration to other road users, noting that some of the crashes were avoidable but caused by non adherence to traffic rules.
