The Adamawa State House of Assembly has approved the 2020 proposed budget estimate of N183.3 billion presented by Governor Ahmadu Fintiri. The approval followed the adoption of the report presented by the chairman of the House Standing Committee on Finance, Budget and Appropriation, Hon Kate Mamuno during Thursday, special session. Presenting the report of the committee before the House, Speaker Aminu Iya Abbas said the committee observed that non-release of fund by the state Ministry of Finance was the major impediment to the implementation of 2019 budget. He said the committee recommended that the estimates of the new budget should be holistically implemented by the executive arm. After deliberations on the report by the lawmakers, the Majority leader of the House, Hon Hammantukur Yettisuri moved a motion for the third reading of the Appropriation bill for passage. It was seconded by Minority Leader Muhammad Mutawalli of Girei Constituency. Speaker Aminu Abbas put the motion for the bill to be read for the third time into voice vote and the lawmakers supported it, following which he directed the Clerk of the House to communicate the clean copy of the approved budget to Governor Ahmadu Fintiri for assent. The governor had presented a budget proposal of N183.36 billion to the House of Assembly only about three weeks ago, November 26. The budget is made up of N97.434 billion or 53 percent for capital projects, and N85.935 billion or 47 percent for recurrent spending.
