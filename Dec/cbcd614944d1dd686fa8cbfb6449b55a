Legendary Arsenal boss, Arsene Wenger, has said Freddie Ljungberg is “fantastically committed” to Arsenal and admits he is happy to offer advice to the Swede. Ljunberg has taken temporary charge of the Gunners, after Unai Emery was sacked last Friday. As a player, he made 326 appearances under Wenger and helped Arsenal win two Premier League titles and three FA Cup trophies. And Wenger is keen for the former midfielder to be a success as a manager with the Gunners. Ljunberg oversaw a 2-2 draw at Norwich on Sunday, while his first home fixture will be against Brighton on Thursday. “I do not want to comment too much on Arsenal. My heart is with the club and I want them to do well,” Wenger told Sky Sports. “I wish Freddie well. He is fantastically committed. He has been doing his job for a long time and he has got an opportunity. “What we want in life is an opportunity. They should get him to work with his ideas and support him. “I am always happy to help my former players and my former club. I will always be available.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
