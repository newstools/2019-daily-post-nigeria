Chelsea boss Frank Lampard, has given the reasons why his side lost 2-0 to Southampton on Thursday. Chelsea lost their Boxing Day encounter at Stamford Bridge to the Saints as their home form worsen. Speaking at a press conference after the game the former England midfielder, said, “These are difficult tests of character. “Today there are questions. When we beat Tottenham we were the best ever but this is different. “We need to turn round this mini bad run at home.” Speaking on Callum Hudson-Odoi, Lampard added, “I thought he put in effort today and tried things. “We have to stick with him as he’s just back from injury. He needs to get his head down and show what he can do for this club. I have faith in him.” On his team selection, Lampard said it’s not always about systems. “If you are on the run we are at home, we need to create a fortress.” Lampard said he is relatively happy but there are clear concerns about the home form of Chelsea. “I learned about the players today,” says Lampard when asked about the possibility of making signings. “Tottenham was a test, every day in training and every defeat is a test.” Lampard added that teams like Southampton are “not stupid” and feels Chelsea’s passing and crossing were not up to standard, compared to the win over Tottenham.
