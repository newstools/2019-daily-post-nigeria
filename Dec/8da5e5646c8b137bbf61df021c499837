The Indian government has suspended data services in some places, amid nationwide protests against a new citizenship law, Al-Jazeera reports. Some television channels reported that police had imposed emergency law in some parts of the capital, New Delhi, that prohibits gatherings. The administration of Uttar Pradesh banned mobile internet services in many parts of the state on Thursday night, including the provincial capital Lucknow. Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state,
where Muslims form nearly 20 percent of its 204 million people, has witnessed the worst crackdown. The force has been accused of killing 19 people there, most of them Muslims. 27 people have been killed in protests across the country since the Citizenship Amendment Act was adopted on December 11. The citizenship law is seen as discriminatory towards Muslims, who make up about 14 percent of India’s 1.3 billion population. The legislation makes it easier for people from non-Muslim minorities in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who settled in India prior to 2015 to get Indian citizenship. More protests are expected on Friday, mainly after the weekly prayers in the capital, Mumbai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru and Chennai.
