President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed deep sadness and shock over the passing on of Senator Benjamin Uwajumogu, representing Imo North Senatorial District. Commiserating with the family, Buhari, in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, said the leadership and members of the National Assembly, and the government and people of Imo State on the tragic transition, the President prays for divine comfort for all who mourn. “President Buhari avers that as a politician and community leader, Sen. Uwajumogu dedicated his life to service, which eminently earned him the trust of the people of Okigwe zone in Imo State, who elected him to represent them first, in the State House of Assembly, where he served as Speaker, and later, in the Senate. “The President notes that from the torrent of tributes that have greeted his unfortunate demise, it is clear that Sen. Uwajumogu served his constituency and fatherland. “He prays for God to grant rest to the soul of the senator”, the statement added. The deceased was a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Uwajumogu was born June 30, 1968 in Okigwe, Ihitte Uboma in Imo. He was a former speaker of the Imo State House of Assembly and was elected into the 9th Senate after a supplementary election. On July 25, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) issued a Certificate of Return to Uwajumogu after an order of Justice Taiwo Taiwo of a Federal High Court, Abuja.
