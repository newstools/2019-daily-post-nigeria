Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola has reacted to his side’s Premier League 3-0 victory over Arsenal on Sunday at the Emirates Stadium. A brace from Kevin De Bruyne and a goal from Raheem Sterling gave Guardiola’s side all three points against the Gunners. “We made an incredible result [against Arsenal] but the way we played against Manchester United was better in many, many things,” Guardiola told the BBC after the match. “I know we are judged on the result but I have a duty to judge the performance, not just the result.” Man City will now take on Leicester City in their next Premier League fixture on December 21.
