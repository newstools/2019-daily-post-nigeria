He also said that defender, Antonio Rudiger will miss Everton clash, adding that the Germany international is still recovering from injury. According to Lampard, Tammy Abraham is good to feature against the Toffees at Goodison Park. “Barkley is back in the squad,” Lampard said at his pre-match press conference on Friday. “Tammy is good. He hasn’t done much in between our games so we will make sure in the morning, but he’s looking good. “Rudiger has had a great week of training and is on the verge of returning.” The kick-off time for the match is 1:30pm.
