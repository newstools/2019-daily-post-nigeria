Femi Fani-Kayode, a social commentator and chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Part, PDP, has responded to a statement by the Sultan of Sokoto wherein he (Sultan) was quoted to have said that “It is a lie to say Christian’s are being persecuted in Nigeria.” CAN had backed the inclusion of Nigeria by the US in the list of nations that tolerate religious persecution, saying that the US was not blind to the alleged killing and alienation of Christians in key political appointments. CAN added that Christians are the targets of the Boko Haram insurgent group and bandits. But, speaking at the closing ceremony of 77th annual Islamic vacation course (IVC) organised by the Muslim Society of Nigeria (MSSN) at Bayero University, Kano, the Sultan of Sokoto countered CAN, saying that its claim is “false and partial.” He had said, “If such persecution really exists, such is supposed to be tabled at the Interfaith Forum where Muslims and Christians leaders meet periodically to discuss issues that would promote harmonious coexistence between the two religions.” “Many Fulanis are atheists whose main interest is to protect their cattle.” Reacting to the statement of the Sultan on Thursday, Fani-Kayode tweeted, “With respect to your Majesty, you are wrong. “To say that Christians are being persecuted in Nigeria is actually an understatement. They are not just being persecuted, they are being slaughtered.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
