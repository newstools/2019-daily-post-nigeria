Arsenal legend, Thierry Henry, has warned the board, that it will take time for Freddie Ljungberg to stamp his mark on the side. Ljungberg has taken over on a temporary basis, following Unai Emery’s sack last Friday. The Swede who played alongside Henry for eight years in North London, had 48 hours to prepare for a 2-2 draw at Norwich. Henry, speaking on Amazon Prime, admitted the performance was virtually identical to what has been seen week in, week out under Emery and has stressed that Ljungberg needs a lot more than just one training session to implement his ideas and turn things around. “Well I think what we’ve seen so far, it’s very difficult to change anything in I think he had one session, or two maybe. “It’s virtually impossible to change anything. And what we saw is what I’ve seen before. [Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang scored two goals and we escaped – when I say “we” you know why. “But that’s what I saw, you know, without the goals of Aubameyang I don’t know where we would have been right now. “So it’s interesting to see how we are going to play against Brighton, and see what Freddie is about. Because that game [against Norwich] was very difficult to see what was happening really,” Henry said.
