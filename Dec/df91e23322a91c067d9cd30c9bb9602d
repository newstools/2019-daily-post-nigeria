President Muhammadu Buhari has saluted social activist, Comrade Amitolu Shittu, as he turns 55 on December 28. He hailed Shittu’s sense of commitment to a better society, “which he resolutely advocates without playing to the gallery, or with any self-promotion and personal aggrandizement”. Buhari’s message was contained in a statement on Thursday by his spokesman, Femi Adesina. The President recalled Amitolu’s long and close relationship with human rights lawyer, Chief Gani Fawehinmi, rising to become Deputy National Chairman of National Conscience Party (NCP), and lauded him for keeping the memory of his mentor evergreen. “Noting that activism is not the same thing as anarchy or fomenting insurrection, President Buhari wishes Amitolu greater years of service to fatherland”, the statement added.
