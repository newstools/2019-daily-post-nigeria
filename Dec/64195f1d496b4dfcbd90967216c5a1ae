No fewer than 358 persons lost their lives in various road crashes across Ogun State from January to December 2023. The Sector Commander, Ogun State Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Clement Oladele, disclosed this, Friday, while speaking at a seminar organised for transporters in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. Oladele disclosed that 50% of the death occurred at diversion points, adding that trucks and other articulated vehicles were responsible for about 80% of the total road accidents in Ogun. While attributing causes of the crashes to over-speeding, wrongful overtaken around construction zones, as well as brake failure, among others, Oladele said FRSC was prepared to prosecute truck owners found culpable of causing road crashes and ensure that compensations were paid to accident victims or their relatives. Speaking on the recent tanker fire disaster in Sango – Ota Toll Gate, Oladele explained that FRSC was already compiling lists of the accident victims for possible prosecution of the company whose truck was responsible for the crash and get the victims compensated. “We know that some of these trucks are over-aged and not well maintained and also overloaded. We will prosecute culprits and make sure that there is compensation for victims. “For the victims, who may have small children, we will make the companies pay compensation to the extent that they give their children scholarships till they finish their university education and also employ them. “We are praying the court to also make FRSC one of the security agencies that will enforce it and it is not the family members of the accident victims that will be looking for these companies,” he said.
