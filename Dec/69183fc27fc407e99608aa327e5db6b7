The All Progressives Congress (APC), Ukwa East/Ukwa West federal constituency of Abia state, have commended President Buhari for revisiting critical issues surrounding the composition of the NDDC board. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari had in a press release issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina last week, approved the composition of the Board of Niger Delta Development Commission(NDDC) after the forensic audit of the organization. Buhari also directed that the Interim Management Team (IMT) of the NDDC be in place till the forensic exercise is completed and that the Commission remains under the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs. However, the APC leadership in Ukwa East and West, through its spokesperson Daberechukwu Ihenko, commended the President for revisiting the nomination ofNwogu Nwogu, who is allegedly involved in anti-party activities to represent Abia State on the board of the Commission. They suggested that for NDDC to live up to its mission, nomination of members into its board should have the input and recommendations of APC leaders from the oil producing areas. “The recent report by the IMT shows that only twenty percent of the projects awarded by the commission went to the oil producing areas of Abia state”. Meanwhile, as at the time of filing this report, immense efforts made by our correspondent to reach Nwogu Nwogu, the Abia representative in NDDC for his comment was unfruitful.
