Everton manager, Carlo Ancelotti, has ruled Alex Iwobi out until 2020. Iwobi picked up a hamstring injury early in the first half of the Toffees’ 0-0 draw with Arsenal last Saturday. Ancelotti watched from the stands as the Super Eagles star limped off the pitch after 15 minutes. “Alex Iwobi is not going to play in the next games. “He is going to rest for two or three weeks, then start [training] with the team,” Ancelotti told Everton TV. The Italian will take charge of his first game against Newcastle on December 28. Everton wrap up their festive Premier League programme, with a game at Manchester City on New Year Day.
