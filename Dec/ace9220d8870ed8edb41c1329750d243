Sultan of Sokoto and President-General of the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar, has kicked against any form of disobedience to court orders. He gave the warning on Thursday in Abuja at the 2019 fourth quarter meeting of the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council with the theme, ‘Religion and civil authorities in dialogue for nation-building.’ Sultan said disobedience to court orders was a recipe for lawlessness and chaos. According to him, “If you are served a court order and you deliberately refused to obey it because you are a governor, president or any influential person, then you are setting a dangerous precedent.” This may not be connected to the travails of Omoyele Sowore in the hands of the Department of State Services. The monarch said, “We must regularly obey and respect the laws of our land. We should never disregard the laws to avoid the consequences. If a court makes a judicial pronouncement on a particular matter, it should be obeyed to the letter. “If you have any problem or disagree with the pronouncement, the next step is to appeal the pronouncement instead of disregarding or violating court judgments. “Ignoring court orders by any category of leaders is equal to setting a bad and dangerous precedent for the future. “Disagreements with any court order should be followed by an appeal and not disregard for such order.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
