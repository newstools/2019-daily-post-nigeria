Legendary Arsenal boss, Arsene Wenger, has said the club can only afford to give Freddie Ljungberg a maximum of six matches, to prove he can replace Unai Emery on a permanent basis. Emery was sacked last Friday, following a poor run of form, with his last game a 2-1 defeat to Frankfurt in the Europa League – match played out in front of a half-empty Emirates Stadium. Ljungberg, who was promoted to Emery’s senior coaching set-up in the summer, took charge of his first game on Sunday, as Arsenal laboured to a 2-2 draw at Norwich. The Swede will hope to secure Arsenal’s first Premier League win in two months at home against Brighton on Thursday. Speaking at an event for the charity Grief Encounter, Wenger said: “If Freddie can’t stabilise in the next five or six games, you will need to put it to a guy with some experience. “But I hope they take off with Freddie.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
