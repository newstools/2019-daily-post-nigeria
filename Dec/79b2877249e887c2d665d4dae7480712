It look like black yuletide in Edo State over the recent fire outbreaks ravaging markets in the state. The latest happened on Sunday as fire engulfed the popular Ekiosa (third) market along Murtala Muhammed way as fire consumed goods worth millions of Naira. Over 500 goats, provisions, textile and other stocks in the market were roasted in the inferno which began at about 11am around the area where livestock are sold. It was gathered that the first floor of Edo development and property agency, EDPA, building near the market was not spared in the inferno. Shop owners and other sympathizers could not help the situation. A shop owner who is also a single mother, Mrs Helen Imafidon who wept uncontrollably at the sight of the fire in her shop, told DAILY POST she lost her stock in two shops to the blaze. She described the fire outbreak as “unfortunate and highly embarrassing.” “Since 11: O clock when the fire began, no rescue. This is not a country. It is a shame, imagine me working hard to provide for my children. My two shops are gone. Over five markets and shopping Malls had been razed by fire in Benin in the last six months. The affected markets include Automobile Spare parts market at Uwelu, Santana market on Sapele road in Benin City and others.
