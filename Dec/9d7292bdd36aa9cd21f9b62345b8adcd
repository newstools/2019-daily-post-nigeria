Six Nigerian soldiers are said to be among travellers abducted by the members of the Islamic state of west African province. They were kidnapped on Tuesday at about 5:00 pm, along Maiduguri, Damaturu road, when the terrorists staged a road block on the main highway in and out of Maiduguri, the Borno State capital. DAILY POST reports that, amongst those abducted are two staff of Red Cross, an international NGO operating in Maiduguri, and eight others. According the reports, the ISWAP had staged the road block pretending to be security operatives on duty for more than three hours before the military vehicle, as well as other vehicles carrying passengers ran into them. The Nigerian Army has not issued statement to that regard as attempt to get official confirmation did not yield fruit. Also security source said on Friday, eighteen civilians were kidnapped by the terror group, Boko Haram during raids in Cameroon’s far North region. “The terrorists stormed several localities of the region, looted foodstuffs, and abducted 18 men and women,” the source said.
