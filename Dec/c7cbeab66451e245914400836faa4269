The Biafra Nations Youth League, BNYL, has warned the Federal Government over threat to arrest the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu if he returns to Nigeria for his mother’s burial. BNYL leader, Princewill Chimezie Richard warned that the rearrest of Kanu would lead to unrest in the South-East. In a statement signed and sent to DAILY POST, Richard said the Biafra agitators especially IPOB members command respects as well as loyalists in the “militant zone of Niger Delta especially the Bakassi Peninsula where he has been arrested twice by soldiers of OPERATIONS DELTA SAFE.” The statement reads: “To us, this threat is not needed at this point in time because it can lead to crises if not well managed.” He reminded the Government of the crises that emanated from Kanu’s previous arrest. “They are ready anytime, any day to swing into action. I have also gone in for it, during my arrest in Ikang-Cameroon border area of Bakassi, during the Militancy (Bakassi Strike Force), in November 2016.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
