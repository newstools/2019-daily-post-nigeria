Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, has reacted to comments made by the General Overseer of the Living Faith Church, Bishop David Oyedepo over the controversial hate speech bill. The cleric in his sermon had claimed the bill was designed to silence Nigerians but said that no one could silence a man of God because he is called by God. Speaking at Shiloh 2019 tagged ‘Breaking limit, Oyedepo said: “Hate speech is one of the craziest ideas ever and it’s dead already.” “Hate speech is one of the craziest ideas ever. You say something truthful about them and they call it hate speech? You can’t silence a man of God because he is called by God’’. He said “A prophet is answerable to God only, what God tells him, he will say. You cannot stand for God and be a loser.” However, Fani-Kayode in a series of tweets wrote: “They are not hanging killers. They are hanging hate speakers. Anyway, that (Bill) is dead already. Prophets are the conscience of the nation”- Bishop David Oyedepo. “Fulani herdsmen have killed 5 policemen in Benue and have burnt 2 of their Hilux vehicles yet no-one has been declared wanted. These herdsmen are a plague. They are evil. They are vermin. They are murderous parasites and homicidal maniacs that feed on the flesh of our people.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
