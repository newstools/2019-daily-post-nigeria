Former Chelsea star, Craig Burley, has advised Manchester United to sack their manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and replace him with former Tottenham Hotspur coach, Mauricio Pochettino. Burley said this after Man United played a 2-2 draw with Aston Villa in the Premier League on Sunday evening. The result against Aston Villa means Solskjaer’s men are now in ninth position on the Premier League table with 18 points after 14 games. “The longer Man United sit on their hands and say ‘no, we’re going to do it this way, we’re quite happy, we’ve got transfer windows coming up, the managers out there that are free – Pochettino, Allegri, they’re going to waltz into other big jobs,” Burley told ESPN. “I think United should go out and get something on paper, an agreement, with Pochettino. “There are lots of deficiencies at Manchester United. “You’ve got the chief executive, the ownership, the football department, the playing staff, and the manager. “It’s a good job he had that new manager bounce when he first came in. “He’s got that new manager bounce, otherwise that [win percentage] would be closer to 10 per-cent.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
