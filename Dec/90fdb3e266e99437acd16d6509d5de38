Anthony Joshua has said fights against Tyson Fury or Deontay Wilder must happen in 2020. The British boxer won his rematch with Ruiz Jr last weekend, to reclaim the WBA, IBF and WBO belts he lost to the Mexican, at Madison Square Garden in June. Speaking on The Zoe Ball Breakfast Show, the two-time world heavyweight champion, who has also officially been ordered by the World Boxing Organisation to defend his WBO title against mandatory challenger, Oleksandr Usyk, stated it is essential he faces at least one of Fury or Wilder next year. “It has to happen in 2020. “We’re in the same division, same era. “If these guys want to make history, especially Wilder because he has the last belt, let’s get it on, let’s make history. “We created history becoming two-time champion of the world and I feel like we can add to that legacy in 2020,” Joshua said.
