Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Friday declared that Nigeria has become a mess. Kanu was reacting after operatives of the Department of State Services, DSS, invaded the courtroom of an Abuja Federal High Court, chased away lawyers before re-arresting Omoyele Sowore, convener of RevolutionNow Movement. Following their invasion of the courtroom, the trial judge, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu, adjourned the matter till February 11, 12 and 13 for definite hearing. The DSS had earlier attempted to re-arrest Sowore but were prevented by those around. The IPOB leader stated that the invasion of a courtroom during proceeding was why Biafra must be actualised. Kanu tweeted: “Nigeria’s secret police DSS manhandling Sowore before abducting him in court today in full view of the presiding judge. “Thankfully the world can now see what a calamitous mess Nigeria has become and why we want Biafra. Now they know Nigeria is a failed state. @CFR_org.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
