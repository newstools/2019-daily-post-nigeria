Shehu Sani, former Kaduna Central Senator, has pointed out how Nigerians can stop Boko Haram from dividing them along religious lines. Sani said the aim of Boko Haram to divide Nigerians can be frustrated through national solidarity against violent extremism. The former lawmaker made the disclosure via his Twitter handle, on Sunday. “Nigerians should not be divided along religious lines because of the dastardly action of the insurgents. “Their aims of achieving that should be frustrated by a national solidarity against violent extremism,” Sani tweeted. This is coming at a time Femi Fani-Kayode, former Aviation Minister, had faulted President Muhammadu Buhari’s appeal that Nigerians should not allow Boko Haram divide them. Fani-Kayode had maintained that Buhari had divided Nigerians along ethnic and religious lines more than any other president in the past. Recall that Buhari had recently appealed to Nigerians not to allow terrorists divide the country along religious lines. This was contained in a statement signed by his Spokesman, Garba Shehu and made available to DAILY POST on Friday.
