Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has hailed Sergio Aguero as “irreplaceable”. Aguero has been out injured since the end of November, but is likely to be on the bench when the champions travel to Wolves on Friday. Guardiola is aware the Argentine star is eager to finish his career in his homelad and admits he is powerless about any decision. “I’d say it will be one of the toughest (tasks). Sergio is irreplaceable. “We have an incredible another striker in Gabriel Jesus and maybe another one will come when Sergio leaves. But he is irreplaceable. ““That moment is much better than four titles in one season or whatever. And he was the guy. More than anything, more than the goals he has done at this club. “But sooner or later it is going to happen (Aguero’s departure), he’ll decide when,” Guardiola told the media ahead of the Premier League clash.
