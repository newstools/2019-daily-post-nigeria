Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has bemoaned his side’s luck, following a goalless draw with Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. Los Blancos will finish 2019 two points behind Barca as a result. Zidane’s men hit the woodwork three times but failed to find the back of the net at the Santiago Bernabeu. “I feel bad for the players because of the effort they put in. We are annoyed that we couldn’t score with all the chances we had. “The ball isn’t going in for us at the moment but there’s no need to be pessimistic. “We have to remember this has been a good season for us. We’ve had a little bit of a sour ending to the year but we can’t wait for 2020 to start,” Zidane told reporters after the game. It was Real’s third draw in a row, after 1-1 and 0-0 stalemates away to Valencia and Barca respectively.
