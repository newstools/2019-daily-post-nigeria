Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has reacted to his side’s UEFA Champions League round of 16 draw with Atletico Madrid. Liverpool were drawn alongside the Spanish La Liga giants, when the draw for last 16 took place in Nyon, Switzerland on Monday. Klopp said Atletico Madrid coach, Diego Simeone won’t have been happy to learn his side had drawn Liverpool in the Champions League knockout stages. “It’s an interesting draw. Before the draw, I actually thought it would be Madrid – either one of the two clubs – and that’s the way it is,” Klopp was quoted by Liverpool’s official website as saying on Monday. “Madrid is the place where we only have fantastic memories, all of us, so that’s great, but this time we play Atletico there and it’s their home ground. “It’s a tough one, but if you go through all of the draws, there are pretty much four or five potential finals already in the last 16. “So, really, really good; a good draw, a difficult game like it should be, but how we most of the time think and say, I don’t think Mr. Simeone is running through his living room and is happy that he got Liverpool. “It will be a tough game. Two teams who are used to playing intense football, different styles and slightly different organisation of course, but both are ready for intensity and that makes it pretty tough for both.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
