Everton has sacked Marco Silva, barely 24 hours after they were beaten 5-2 by Liverpool in the Premier League. The result left the Toffees in 18th place. Silva arrived in May 2018 and led Everton to an eighth-place finish last season. A number of candidates are being considered to take over from Silva, with former manager David Moyes a frontrunner. The Scot, who previously managed Everton from 2002-2013, has been out of work since leaving West Ham in the summer of 2018. Everton face a tough run of fixtures over the festive period, starting with a home fixture against Chelsea on Saturday.
