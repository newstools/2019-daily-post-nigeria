Former lawmaker representing Bayelsa East in the upper legislative chamber, Senator Murray Ben-Bruce, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to show support for British fighter, Anthony Joshua when he takes on Mexican-American fighter, Andy Ruiz Jr in their heavyweight rematch. DAILY POST recalls that Ruiz stunned the boxing world when he knocked Joshua down four times before stopping him in the seventh round of their heavyweight world title fight in June. Ruiz will put his three belts back on the line in the rematch when the rivals clash in the desert of Saudi Arabia on December 7. In a tweet on his official Twitter page on Monday, Ben Bruce wrote: “I want you to know we are with you, @anthonyfjoshua. “I am confident that on December 7, you will go out and make yourself and your motherland proud. I am behind you. Nigerians are behind you. “I call on @MBuhari to show support for Anthony as he puts 🇳🇬 on the world stage, Dec7.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
