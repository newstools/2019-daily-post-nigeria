Mino Raiola, agent to Manchester United’s Paul Pogba, has debunked speculations that his client could leave the club in the January window. Pogba, 26, has long been linked with a move away from Old Trafford. Real Madrid and Juventus are believed to be interested in securing his signature. Raiola confirmed that Pogba had been in contact with Madrid, but that he remained committed to United when the move didn’t go through. “Paul wants to be successful and happy and wants to win trophies and he would love to do that with Manchester United. “Okay, there was big interest from Real Madrid and Manchester didn’t let him go. We didn’t make a fuss about it and he didn’t make a fuss about it because I work in accordance with the player. “You know other players can take things to extremes but Paul doesn’t like that. So you work differently. “There was an interest from Real Madrid but they didn’t let him go, and I’m sorry because I think that [with] Paul being French then [Zinedine] Zidane is an important factor in French football history,” Raiola told the Telegraph.
