Nigerian winger, Marvin Akinlabi, netted his second league goal of the season for Real Madrid Castilla, as played out a 2-2 draw against Internacional de Madrid on Saturday. Rufo opened the scoring for the visitors in the third minute at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium. However, Alvaro Fidalgo made it 1-1 from the penalty spot. Akinlabi then forced home the ball, following a defensive mixup just before the interval. Rufo scored his second of the match, after Real Madrid’s De la Fuente was sent off, to make it 2-2. Akinlabi’s other goal this season came against Racing Ferrol on October 26. The 19-year-old has made seven starts in the Segunda División B.
