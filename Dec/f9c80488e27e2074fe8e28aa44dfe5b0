Nigeria’s Senate President, Dr Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan on Monday night washed off his hands from the controversial Hate Speech and Internet Falsehoods and Manipulations and other related Matters Bill. Lawan said in Abuja at a Luncheon/Media briefing that, the fate of those bills hangs in the public domain, saying if the public is opposed to the passage of the bills, Senate would not act otherwise. Both bills have scaled first reading on the floor of the Senate with attendant heavy criticism by the public, allaying fears that the media would be games, if there were passed into law. Lawan stressed that it was left for Nigerians to decide if both bills would be passed, adding that the Senate would rely on the preponderance of their opinions.
