The governor of Ebonyi state chief David Umahi at the weekend said anyone who will succeed him in the 2023 governorship election will not be older than him. Umahi made this known while addressing executive members of the state who paid him a Christmas homage at his country home at Uburu community, Ohaozara LGA of Ebonyi state. The governor who noted that he will not allow political jobbers to distract him from his plans to develop the state, stressed further that it is too early for him to engage in 2023 politics. He avowed that people who are allegedly desperate for power in 2023, cannot take away his visions and attempt to better the lives of the people in the state. “I will not support anyone that is older than me for Governor come 2023. We need someone that is energetic and ready to lead with every commitment.” He continued, “I will not engage in 2023 politics now, I can only talk politics a year to the end of my tenure not now. We are more concerned with developing the state and cannot be distracted by desperate people who are hungry for power and not for the betterment of the people” he stated.
