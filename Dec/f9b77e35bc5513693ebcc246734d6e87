The Cross River Command of the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) has called on foreign migrants, who are yet to be captured in its database, to do so before the January 2020 deadline. The Comptroller of NIS in the state, Mr Okey Ezugwu, made the call during the end of year party held at the Command’s headquarters to celebrate the year’s activities in Calabar. Ezugwu said that the Federal Government gave six months for the migrants to register for free in the NIS database so that they can be accounted for. According to him, the command cannot guarantee the stay of any migrant that fails to register within the stipulated period in the state, NAN reports. “The government is magnanimous enough to say whether your status is okay or not, it should be documented that you reside in Nigeria. By January 2020, we cannot guarantee the stay of any foreign national who has not registered on our e-migrant portal. “Those who fail to register following what government has said will not be guaranteed their stay in Cross River anymore,’’ he said. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the heads of security agencies in the state including the Navy, Police, Air Force, Federal Road Safety Corps and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps attended the event.
