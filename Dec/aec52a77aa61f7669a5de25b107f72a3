Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has hailed Paul Pogba as the “best all-round midfielder in the world”. Pogba came for on United in the 64th minute of their 2-0 defeat to Watford on Sunday, making his first appearance since September due to ankle problems. Asked whether Pogba will start against Newcastle on Boxing Day, Solskjaer told reporters today: “Let’s see how he reacts, how he feels. He did really well when he came on, a big plus. “It might be that we do get him in from the start because you just want to get more and more into the team when he plays. “He can play anywhere, he can play the whole midfield, he is a box-to-box midfielder. He can drop deep, get it and play them long passes. He can get higher up and combine like he did on Sunday. “It depends on the game. That’s the beauty of having Paul because he is the best all-round midfielders in the world, he can do all the roles. It’s great to have him back” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
