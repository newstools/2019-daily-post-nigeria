Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, has been crowned the Men’s Player of the Year, at the Dubai Globe Soccer Awards. It is the sixth time the Portugal captain is winning the prize. “I have to thank my family, my girlfriend, my boy there, Cristiano, my three kids who are waiting for me in the hotel, my friends, my teammates of Juventus and the national team, my agent, all the people here tonight who support this gala,” Ronaldo said. “I have to say thank you to the Arabic community, which is always great with me. I have to thank Dubai as well – it’s a marvellous place to be, I’m coming every year and I love this place. “And finally to thank [everyone] who voted for me. It’s a great honour to be here and receive this amazing award. I hope to be here next year to receive this award, of course. Thanks to everyone, and a happy New Year.” England’s Lucy Bronze won the inaugural award for the Best Woman Player.
