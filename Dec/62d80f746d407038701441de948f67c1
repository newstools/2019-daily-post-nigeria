New Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has warned that any player who doesn’t buy into his philosophy, will be considered “not good enough” to represent the club. Arteta stated this during his official unveiling on Friday. Ahead of his appointment, senior members of the Arsenal squad voiced concern that the Spaniard wasn’t experienced enough. Captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang hass been linked with a January move away from the Emirates, along some of his team-mates. Arteta didn’t name names in his press conference, but did send a message to the players. “I want to do things my way by convincing them that this is the right way. I want people who are comfortable with what I’m asking them to do,” said Arteta. “I want people who deliver passion and energy to the football club. Anybody who doesn’t buy into it is not good enough for this club and culture. “I need to understand how they’re feeling, what they’re lacking. If I reach that point I can help them, they will trust me and follow me.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
