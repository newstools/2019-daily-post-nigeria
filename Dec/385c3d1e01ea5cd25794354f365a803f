Watford have sacked Quique Sanchez Flores, just 85 days after he was re-appointed for a second spell at the Premier League club. Flores, who replaced Javi Gracia after four games of the league season, won just one of his 10 Premier League matches. Watford suffered their eighth league defeat in a 2-1 loss against Southampton on Saturday, which saw them remain bottom of the table on eight points and six adrift of safety. The decision was taken after Sanchez Flores met with chief executive and chairman Scott Duxbury along with owner Gino Pozzo on Sunday. “Quique is a man of great integrity and it was clear how much he wanted to have a positive impact, but ultimately results have dictated our decision. “The appointment of a new head coach is imminent, and with nearly two-thirds of the season remaining, we will provide all the support necessary to make the coming months successful,” Duxbury said in a club statement.
