Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard has disclosed what he told his players at half-time during his side’s Premier League 2-1 win over Arsenal on Sunday. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang opened scoring for Mikel Arteta’s men in the first-half of the encounter. But two late goals from Jorginho and Tammy Abraham gave Lampard’s men all three points against the Gunners at the Emirates Stadium. Asked if he was angry with his players at half-time, Lampard was quoted by Metro UK as saying at post-match press conference: “Possibly. From my point of view, you can accept a miss-pass but you can’t accept lethargy in a London derby. “The players were told that and they delivered. “The second half was nothing to do with tactics it was all to do with spirit and desire. I still haven’t bounced back from Boxing Day mentally (loss to Southampton). “Our next home games we’ll do everything we can to turn the corner. We’re still in fourth and want more and the home games have been different so we have to focus on them when they come around.” Lampard added: ‘We were so awful for 30 mins, slow lethargic, nervous. The opposite of against Tottenham. “We gave Arsenal everything they wanted. We made the change early, felt it had to be done. Second half we dominated. After 10 mins or so it was clear that Arsenal had seen us play against Tottenham and made us into a back five instead of a back three.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
