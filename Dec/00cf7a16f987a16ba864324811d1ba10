Dr Habib Nuhu, a Geologist and expert in international Energy Policy and Energy Economics, has urged the federal government to encourage establishment of mini-grid system to tackle the challenges bedeviling electricity supply in the country. NAN reports that he made the call in Sokoto State in a paper presented at a National Colloquium on Sunday. Nuhu, who was a Keynote Presenter at the event, said that Nigeria needed to decentralise its energy station in order to be able to tackle most of the arising problems in the system. “Grid centralisation may not be a panacea to Nigeria’s electricity supply but off and mini grid system must be encouraged. “Nigeria should have an integrated national energy policy that will be geared toward driving market oriented industry that has little or no barrier to entry,” he said. The geologist added that for any society to excel in the global energy drive it must leverage on God given capacity of women, “as such we should transform them to productive economic agents”. “There should be a deliberate effort geared toward incentivizing to enroll on energy related vocational training and financing models designed to encourage women in energy business drive and participation. “Moreover, focus should be on entrepreneurial opportunity that leverages on competitive advantage of local community for energy to serve as feedstock to drive economic activities like agriculture,” he said.
