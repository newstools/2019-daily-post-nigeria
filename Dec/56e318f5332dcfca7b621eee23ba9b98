Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has praised his players following a 2-1 win at Manchester City on Saturday. Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial scored in the first half, to put United in firm control at the Etihad. Although, Nicolas Otamendi pulled one back for the Premier League champions, however, Solskjaer’s men held on for a win that took them into the top five. “Fantastic, we were exceptional at the start of the game. We looked like we could carve them open, we could have been 3,4,5 up to be fair. “We played the best team in the world today in my opinion. The best coach, the best players. “We didn’t just do long ball, there we quick transitions and we deserved it. “Man United character, values of working as hard as you can and being knackered when you come off the pitch. We dropped a little bit too much after 30 minutes.” “It’s a Man United performance on my mould. I love the boys going forward, but there were times today when I thought we could have kept the ball a lot better,” Solskjaer told Sky Sports.
