Former England manager, Sam Allardyce has expressed his desire to become Arsenal’s new manager. The Former Everton manager also revealed how he will fix Arsenal, who are currently struggling in the Premier League this season. DAILY POST had reported that Arsenal are looking for a replacement for Unai Emery, who was fired at the end of last month. “Would I take Arsenal? Of course you’d take Arsenal,” Allardyce told TalkSport. “I’m the man who’d take Arsenal. ‘But I’m never going to be in the frame, don’t worry about that. “I just think that what they’re looking for they need to be very quick about. They need to be very precise in what they need to do. “I don’t think I’m very fashionable for Arsenal, that’s the problem.” He added: “Some of the way it’s been portrayed of me as a manager, it wouldn’t be associated with Arsenal as a football club of how or what style I’ve tried to play like. “I’ve tried to be pragmatic in what I do and what style I play. I’ve always picked a style to suit the players. “I know there’s a reputation at a football club of how you should play but realistically when you go into a club that’s struggling it’s about the capabilities of the players you’ve got to find and how you play to those capabilities.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
