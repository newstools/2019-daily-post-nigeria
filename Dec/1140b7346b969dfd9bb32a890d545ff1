Arsene Wenger has backed Mikel Arteta to be a successful Arsenal manager. Arteta is expected to be announced as the Gunners’ permanent boss, following Unai Emery’s sack as manager. Wenger who left the club after 22 years in May 2018, believes the Spaniard has the ability to succeed at the Emirates. “I am an Arsenal supporter. And at the moment, I support the manager in charge and the manager in charge is Ljungberg. When Arteta will be in charge, I will support Arteta. “He [Arteta] is intelligent, he has passion, he has knowledge, but Ljungberg [does] as well. “I believe that Arteta has certainly a great future, he has certainly learned a lot in his first position as an assistant coach and after that as well, he will have to deal with the fact that he has no experience at that level and he will have to get surrounded well,” Wenger told Sky Sports.
