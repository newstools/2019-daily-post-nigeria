Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard has confirmed that defender, Antonio Rudiger is ready and fit to play against Lille in Tuesday’s Champions League fixture. He also said that he was happy to have the Germany international back in his squad to tackle the Ligue 1 side. Lampard’s men head to the game following a 3-1 defeat to Everton in the Premier League over the weekend. “It’s good to have him back,” Lampard told the assembled media at his press conference today. “He’s been training really well. He’s got a lot of his fitness work done, his injury has healed,” Lampard was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as saying in his pre-match press conference on Monday. “It will potentially be difficult for him [to return after a long time out], but our guard against that was to give him a lot of work. We have managed to create some things behind the scenes here in training that look like matchplay, and some pure running as well. He has come through all that. “You can only speak as you look at him, and he looks fit and ready to go, and I know he’s hungry. In terms of building him up, rightly so, he’s a good defender. People maybe overlook the fact we started the season with five big players all injured for a period of time. You do miss those individuals, so let’s see what he can add to us,” he added.
