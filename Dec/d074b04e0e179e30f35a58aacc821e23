The middle-aged man, Enietie Edem who hailed from Akwa Ibom state was said to have died in apparent suicide without a note. One of the residents, who identified himself as Efiok said, “The man was from Akwa Ibom State and very friendly. He is quite huge and suddenly he began to lose weight at a point before he took his life. I believe that his loss of weight was because he had no job or His action could be as a result of marital issues. “The police came to arrest his lover who always spoke of how Edem complains of her late-night movements. “We just came this morning and saw this. Maybe he was tired of life before he killed himself.” Reacting to the incident, Spokesman of the Rivers State Police Command, DSP Nnamdi Omoni said the death of Edem is being investigated by the Ozuoba Police Division.
