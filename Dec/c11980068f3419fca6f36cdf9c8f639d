Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has criticised his players after their 2-0 loss to Watford on Sunday. Solskjaer lamented the sluggish nature of his players in the first-half and suggested that they approached the game as if it was an exhibition match. The shocking 2-0 defeat was Red Devils first loss in seven games. It also meant they remained in 8th position in the Premier League table with the top four still out of reach. “We started the game slowly,” Solskjaer told Sky Sports. “The first half was very, very poor from both sides and when you concede two goals like we did in quick succession with their two shots on target we gave ourselves too much to do. “We had been doing well but you have to earn every single point in this league. It was too slow, it was like a testimonial in the first half from both teams. “But it was during the second half when Watford was able to take the lead and score the goals which ultimately won the game. “We didn’t deserve to win the game by the way we played. We were too slow in possession, too slow without the ball, not enough intensity. “We didn’t have enough to get back. You have to be out there and ready. If you don’t take your chances you get punished. “They took their chances. We didn’t take our chances. You have to earn every inch, every chance. I can talk about it all day long. “We have to face the fact we have two games coming up that we have to improve on.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
