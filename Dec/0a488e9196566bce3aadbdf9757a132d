Sky Sports pundit, Graeme Souness, has once again slammed Video Assistant Referee (VAR), after it allowed a Liverpool goal and denied Wolves theirs, as the Premier League leaders won 1-0 on Sunday. According to him, “we cannot go on like this”. Souness even went ahead to propose a change to the offside rule, which he believes will cut out most of the controversy. “The ball ends up in the back of the net, you think it’s perfectly fine, but then you have to wait,” Souness said in the studio. “I just don’t get it. It’s so tight, very hard to call. “From my thinking, there’s a simple way to get over this. Instead of going down the road where any part of the body the player can score a goal with is offside… We’re in the entertainment business. That’s why 90% of people turn up in the stadium and watch on TV, to see goals. We’re denying them the pleasure of seeing goals. “We should change it to: if any part of the striker is onside, so his foot could be behind the line but most of his body is beyond it, we should allow the goal to stand. It would take away the majority of the grey areas and we’d see more goals. “Then if a team concedes a goal they have to become more adventurous. They have to start chasing the game so the chances are you’d see more goals. “We cannot go on like this, there’s too much frustration involved right now.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
