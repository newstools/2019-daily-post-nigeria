Arsenal head coach, Mikel Arteta, has backed Bernd Leno following his howler in their 2-1 defeat to Chelsea on Sunday. Leno flapped at a Mason Mount free kick, to allow Jorginho make it 1-1 after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang opened scoring in the first half. Tammy Abraham then slipped his shot through the German’s leg to ensure the Blues left with all three points. Arteta, speaking to Sky Sports after the game, insisted that Leno will save more points throughout the season. He said: “He will be down and when an error costs points it’s harder. We have to respect what he’s done at the club and get him back on board. “I am really disappointed with the result. I’m pleased with a lot of things I have seen and how they buy into what I want. “It’s physically tough to maintain the level Chelsea had with young players. It wasn’t that they didn’t want to do it.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
