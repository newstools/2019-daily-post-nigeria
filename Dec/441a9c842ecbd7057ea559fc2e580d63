Former Manchester United captain, Roy Keane, has questioned Tottenham’s mentality, following the Red Devils’ 2-1 win over Manchester City on Saturday. First-half goals from Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, saw United take control of the derby at the Etihad. Although Nicolas Otamendi pulled one back in the 85th minute, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side held on. United had beaten Jose Mourinho’s Spurs at Old Trafford on Wednesday evening, but Keane says that result was “not a big deal”. He told Sky Sports: “I said before the show, I didn’t think beating Tottenham at home was a big deal for Manchester United. Spurs, we know their mentality. “But beating Man City will only given the players confidence. They’ve been criticised a lot recently and today we need to take our hats off. “They were outstanding. It was a Manchester United performance. The way they managed the game, the blocks, the speed, it was brilliant. “For me that’s what Manchester United is all about.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
