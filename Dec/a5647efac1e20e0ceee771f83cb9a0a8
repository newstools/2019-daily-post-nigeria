Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has hinted that Paul Pogba could make a return to his squad, for their New Year’s Day clash at Arsenal. Pogba made a return prior to Christmas against Watford, but was missing again when United saw off Burnley 2-0 in their last fixture. Solskjaer, speaking to the media on Tuesday, explained that the 26-year-old was only being rested. Quizzed on whether the France midfielder will form part of his plans for the game at the Emirates, the Norwegian said: “Yeah, I would think so.” He added on why Pogba missed out against Burnley: “When you’ve been out for a while, it’s always going to take time to be 100 per cent. “He just needed another day, probably, of recovery.” Scott McTominay is the only notable absentee for United, although Ashley Young and Axel Tuanzebe also sat out a training session on Monday.
