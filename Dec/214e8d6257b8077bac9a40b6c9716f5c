Former Liverpool striker, Michael Owen and erstwhile Tottenham Hotspur boss, Tim Sherwood, have praised Nigeria international Kelechi Iheanacho after he netted against West Ham on Saturday. Iheanacho scored a poacher’s goal for Leicester during the first half of their 2-1 win against West Ham United at the London Stadium. Ayoze Perez created the goal for the former Manchester City man, whose brilliant header from close range gave Brendan Rodgers side the lead after 39 minutes. Owen and Sherwood praised the Super Eagles attacker for his movement in the build-up to the goal. Owen told Supersport, “Leicester recycled the ball, keep the ball in play just as well. Lack of communication, lack of awareness, you can just see there Perez’s header remains in play. “There is a quick reaction from Iheanacho and it’s a good goal from him.” For Sherwood, “Ayoze Perez, it was good. Fabiański was coming across, his footwork was good, he’s coming across but Iheanacho, the way he just checks his run, and then he can’t shift his feet and he heads it straight into the corner, it was a good finish.” Iheanacho has scored five goals in six appearances across all competitions for Leicester this season.
