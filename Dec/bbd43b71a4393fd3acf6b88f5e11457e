Real Madrid winger, Gareth Bale, has said Tottenham Hotspur decided to hire Jose Mourinho because they want to win trophies. Speaking with BT Sport, Bale stated that Mourinho is the perfect manager to take charge of his former club. Mourinho was appointed as Spurs boss two weeks ago, after Mauricio Pochettino was dismissed. Ever since he took charge, the Portuguese has overseen three wins from three matches. Mourinho takes Spurs to ex-employers Manchester United on Wednesday night. “Having [Jose] Mourinho there is an amazing statement from the club, I think he’s a serial winner. “Tottenham want to win trophies and I don’t think there’s a better partnership than Mourinho and Tottenham together to try and win some trophies,” Bale said.
