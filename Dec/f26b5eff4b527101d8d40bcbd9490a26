Former Manchester United assistant manager, Steve Round, has joined Mikel Arteta at Arsenal. He confirmed to Sky Sports that he will become Arteta’s new assistant head coach. Arteta was confirmed as the Gunners’ long-term replacement for Unai Emery, who was sacked last month. “Mikel called me in the week and asked me if I would join his staff and I jumped at the chance straight away,” Round told Sky Sports. “It’s a great opportunity at a magnificent football club and just having brief conversations with Mikel I think he’s going to be a really, really top manager. “It’s a bold decision because he’s young and it’s his first time, but having spoken to him he sounds to me like a really experienced guy already. “I had the privilege of coaching him as a player at Everton and he was an outstanding professional and it’s great to be back.” The 49-year-old’s most recent job was at Aston Villa as Director of Football before he left the job in 2018 after two years Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
