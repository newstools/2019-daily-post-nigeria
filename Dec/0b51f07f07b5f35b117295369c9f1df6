The Ogun State police command has informed the public that it has placed an embargo on any form of street carnival or public procession. It said the decision became necessary due to series of violence and wanton destruction of valuable properties associated with such carnivals in recent time. DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, command spokesman, in a statement on Saturday, disclosed that the Commissioner of Police and his management reviewed the security situation in the state. “The meeting came to conclusion that the street carnivals have become an Avenue through which some unscrupulous elements as well as cultists are using to unleash terror on innocent members of the public”, it said “As an organisation saddled with constitutional responsibility of protecting life and properties, the command can not fold its arms while hoodlums will be making life difficult for law abiding citizens of the state. “Therefore, all forms of street carnival are hereby banned and anybody who after this release organised carnival, rally, procession or blocked any public road anywhere in the state will be made to face the full wrath of the law”.
