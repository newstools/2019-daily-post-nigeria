Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is considering starting Paul Pogba against Newcastle on Boxing Day. the UK Mirror reports. Pogba came off the bench in Sunday’s 2-0 defeat at Watford, as he returned from an ankle injury that has kept him out since September. Axel Tuanzebe did not feature at Vicarage Road through injury and remains a doubt. Diogo Dalot, sidelined for two months, is closing in on a return, while fellow defenders Eric Bailly, Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Marcos Rojo continue to build fitness. Manchester United provisional squad: De Gea, Romero, Grant, Kovar, Wan-Bissaka, Dalot, Young, Jones, Lindelof, Maguire, Tuanzebe, Shaw, Williams, Laird, Fred, Garner, Gomes, Matic, McTominay, Pogba, Pereira, James, Mata, Lingard, Chong, Greenwood, Martial, Rashford.
