Arsenal legend, Liam Brady, has criticised playmaker, Mesut Ozil ahead of the club’s English Premier League (EPL) clash with West Ham United on Monday night. Brady said the ex-Germany international should not be playing for Arsenal following his display during Arsenal’s 2-1 shock home defeat to Brighton on Thursday. According to him, Arsenal interim manager, Freddie Ljungberg needs to stand up to Ozil and drop him from the team that will take on West Ham, adding that the former Real Madrid star is not trying for the Gunners. “Have you seen Ozil? Have we seen Ozil? He’s on £350,000-a-week. I know people go on about wages but he’s on £350,000-a-week and he’s not really trying,” Brady was quoted by Metro UK as saying. “I would have a kid in the team who is going to run around and show some enthusiasm. “You’ve got to make decisions. He should not be in the team. Emery bombed him from the team for at least two months and then backtracked and put him in the team again and I think that contributed to his downfall. “They have a number of youngsters who have done well in the Europa League and League Cup, they had a tremendous game up at Liverpool. “But I think Freddie is reluctant to go up against the big names in the squad. But if you are going to make an impression that’s what you need to do. Ozil should not be playing for Arsenal.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
