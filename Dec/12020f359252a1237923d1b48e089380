Arsenal hero, Charlie Nicholas has predicted the winner of the Premier League encounter between Leicester City and Liverpool. The former Arsenal forward said that Brendan Rodgers’ Leicester side are going to beat the Reds. According to him, it is the Foxes that will bring to an end Jurgen Klopp’s side 34-game unbeaten run in the Premier League. Nicholas said his prediction was based on Leicester’s “energy and movement.” “It is a stunning game. I have seen a lot from Leicester but they are still a bit off the top level. “Liverpool have been out celebrating their new trophy and I don’t blame them for it – their fixture list is supposed to be hampering them, but they have played two games in Doha where they were not overly stressed in either. “I cannot see the excuses with fatigue or travelling, but I think Leicester will turn this around here. The energy and movement will cause Liverpool problems, who may want to play on the counter-attack; Liverpool are due a loss and I think this will be the game,” Nicholas was quoted by Fanside.
