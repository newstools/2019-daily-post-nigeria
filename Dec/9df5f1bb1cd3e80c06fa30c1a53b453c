Vice President Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has given two reasons why he was absent at the Prof. Wole Soyinka’s 2019 anti-corruption defender award. The event was organised by the Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism. Osinbajo, who was absent at the event, was recognized and awarded the Integrity Specialty of the Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism’s Anti-corruption Defender. However, the Vice President cited the issues surrounding the invasion of the Federal High Court and the re-arrest of SarahaReporters Publisher, Omoyele Sowore as one of the reasons he shunned the event. Given his reasons for being absent in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Monday by his Spokesman, Laolu Akande, Osinbajo said, “I am extremely grateful for the recognition and award of the “Integrity Specialty of the Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism’s Anti-corruption Defender Award of 2019” to me. “The award, I note, is for our Justice reform efforts in Lagos State. I had accepted the award with pride on behalf of the excellent Justice Sector team we had. “However, two reasons explain my absence. First is that I am currently in Abu Dhabi for an international meeting under the auspices of the government of the UAE where I am the keynote speaker. “Second, in view of the developments on Friday in the Sowore case, I think it would be insensitive and inappropriate to attend the ceremony. “Please accept my heartfelt apologies and extend the same to the other members of the organizing team. God bless you.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
