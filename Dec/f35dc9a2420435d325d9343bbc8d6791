Manchester United could be without Scott McTominay for up to eight weeks, after scans confirmed injured knee ligaments, SportsMail reports.

Solskjaer had originally hoped McTominay would be out for just four weeks. However, United’s medical team have provided a more pessimistic diagnosis. Solskjaer will now look to pick his midfield three from Nemanja Matic, Fred and Andreas Perreira against the Gunners.
