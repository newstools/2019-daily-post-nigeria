Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, has described himself as the luckiest politician that was assisted by God to overcome the onslaught of the Buhari government during the 2019 elections. Speaking during the Thanksgiving Service of Senator Representing Rivers South-East Senatorial District, Senator Barinada Mpigi, at Saint Cyprian’s Anglican Church, Koroma Town, Tai Local Government Area, on Sunday, Wike said he fought Federal Might and survived because God was with him. He said: “I am the luckiest politician who has always received God’s Blessing. I don’t know how many people who have fought Federal Might and succeeded. “God fought for us during the last elections and we were victorious. That is why I will always support the Church. I will always continue to give thanks to God for his mercies. ” Governor Wike reiterated that only God has the power to enthrone his successor in 2023. “I will not install my successor. It is God that will determine who will succeed me. Only God has the power to install my successor. “However, I will fervently pray that my party succeeds in 2023. The insistence to plant a successor is mainly for selfish reasons. Everyone with the right capacity should come forward to tell Rivers people, why they should vote for him/her, he said. The governor described Senator Barinada Mpigi as a dedicated politician who works hard to achieve results. Wike said that he has worked closely with Senator Mpigi since 1999 because he is a trustworthy politician. He said that Mpigi has examined both PDP and APC, with the conclusion that PDP is the hope for Nigeria.
