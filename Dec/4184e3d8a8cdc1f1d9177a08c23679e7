Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has left Paul Pogba out of Saturday’s trip to Burnley. Pogba who recently made his return from injury, came off the bench for their last two fixtures against Watford and Newcastle United. The Frenchman will however not be available for Solskjaer at Turf Moor. Aaron Wan-Bissaka is among the substitutes for the game. Wan-Bissaka provided his first assist as a United player, when they beat Newcastle 4-1 on Boxing Day. The Red Devils play Arsenal next on New Year’s Day at the Emirates.
