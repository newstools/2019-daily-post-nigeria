Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has disclosed he might feature Diogo Dalot when his side takes on Colchester United in the Carabao Cup fixture on Wednesday at Old Trafford. He also said that midfielder, Paul Pogba is working hard to return to action for the Red Devils, adding that the France international is sick. Pogba and Dalot have missed several matches for Solskjaer’s side so far this season due to injuries. Speaking ahead of his side’s clash with Colchester on Wednesday, Solskjaer was quoted by Man United’s official website as saying: “Maybe Diogo might return against Colchester after he’s had a week of training, but probably no one else,” said Ole. “Of all things Pogba is now struck down with illness and he’s been off for two or three days. That’s not beneficial and that’s probably set him back quite a bit. “As I’ve said so many times, Paul is a top player that we want to see playing his best football at Man United. “We just need to get him match fit. He might be half an hour, 45, 60, 90 minutes – who knows – in the first game. We’re working hard to get him back, but now he’s ill.” He added: “We’ve got a squad and we’ve got to rotate,” the manager said. “We did that on Thursday [against AZ Alkmaar] and we’re going to make changes again because there are so many games. “I think that the team we’re going to put out is strong enough to win the game. At home, against a League Two team, you’re big favourites and you’ve got to expect that. “But we’ve got to go out there and earn it. It’s going to be strong enough to create chances and, hopefully, score goals.” The kick-off time for the match is 9pm.
