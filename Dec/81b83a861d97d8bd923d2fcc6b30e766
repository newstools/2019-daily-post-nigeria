The Ogun State Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps said it has arrested two persons for allegedly shooting one of its personnel in the leg in order to evade arrest. DAILY POST reported Monday that a gunman, who claimed to be a policeman, allegedly shot the FRSC officer, who was controlling traffic in the Ibafo area of the state, in the leg on Sunday. The unidentified gunman who drove a vehicle with number plate, WED 264 YE, was said to have been stopped for driving against the traffic, but he allegedly pulled out a pistol and shot the FRSC personnel in the leg and drove off. However, the Sector Commander, Ogun State Command, FRSC, Clement Oladele, on Tuesday, confirmed that two suspects had been arrested in connection with the incident and had been handed over to the police at the Ibafo Police Station. Oladele informed that the suspects, one of whom impersonated the police, were arrested through the National Vehicle Identification Number Scheme. “Sequel to the attack on a FRSC personnel by an unknown gunman, who was driving against the traffic on Sunday, December 15, 2019, along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, diligent search from the National Vehicle Identification Number Scheme led to the arrest of two suspects, who are being charged for assault, armed robbery and impersonation of a policeman,” Oladele stated. However, the Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, said one of those arrested was the owner of the vehicle used to perpetrate the crime, adding that the gunman had escaped. Oyeyemi debunked claim that the yet to be apprehended gunman was a policeman. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
