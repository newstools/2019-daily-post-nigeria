A month after a one-year-old child, Gold Kolawole went missing at a popular Ondo Church, Sotitobire Miracle Centre, the founder of the Church, Prophet Babatunde Alfa has finally been arrested by officials of the Department of State Services, DSS. It was gathered that Prophet Alfa was picked at his church by the DSS after a petition against him about a missing child in his church. On November 10, Gold went missing at the Sunday service in the church after his mother, Mrs. Modupe Kolawole dropped him at the children’s department of the church which is located at the Oshinle Quarters area of Akure, the Ondo State capital. Following the mysterious disappearance of her son at the church, Mrs. Kolawole accused the Prophet of being behind the family’s predicament. She also alleged that Prophet Alfa has been using his contacts to harass them from getting justice. According to a source at the DSS office, “Pastor Babatunde was invited this afternoon to our office for interrogation after we got a petition about a missing child in his church. “We had earlier contacted him through his lawyer but both of them were not cooperating with us. “Fortunately, he showed up this afternoon after intense pressure, so we had to quickly swing into action by taking him to his house for a search. “We also searched his church thoroughly. “His case is being moved to Abuja for further investigation.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
