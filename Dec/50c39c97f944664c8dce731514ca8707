Officials of the Lagos State Building Control Agency, LASBCA, at the weekend, shut down 19 buildings in Igbogbo Baiyeku area of Ikorodu, for violating the town planning laws. A Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, and a Cherubim and Seraphim Church, on Bamgbose Street and eight other buildings, were affected after the owners failed to produce building permits and other required documents. General Manager, LASBCA, Engr. Abiola Kosegbe, who led the enforcement team, said buildings were also sealed at Kosebinu Orepekun Street, Market Street, Ogolonto, among others. Kosegbe explained that government was on enforcement and sensitisation campaign to forestall further collapse of buildings in the state. The official warned that any developer that did not notify government about development of their structure could be arrested. Kosegbe added that most of the properties sealed had already been served abatement notices, adding that LASBCA also engaged in post construction audit, where those who had already completed their buildings were asked to present documents to ascertain if they got the needed permits to erect such structures. Chairman, Igbogbo Baiyeku Local Council Development Area, Olusesan Daini, said the essence of the enforcement and sensitisation exercise was to reduce incidence of building collapse and maintain standard. “The problem we have is that people don’t build right. Affected residents are to go to LASBCA to regularise their documents and those building now should get their building permits. “They should be citizens. Government is not doing this alone to generate revenue, but to protect the citizens,” Daini stressed.
