Juventus manager, Maurizio Sarri, has refused to blame his attack led by Cristiano Ronaldo, for their 3-1 Super Coppa Italiana defeat to Lazio on Sunday. Instead, Sarri claimed his team lacked energy. The Bianconeri were beaten by Lazio for the second time this month, as Senad Lulic scored one goal and had a hand in another. Sarri started Ronaldo, Paulo Dybala and Gonzalo Higuain, as he did for wins over Udinese and Sampdoria. He, however, took off Higuain and brought on Wales midfielder, Aaron Ramsey, with the game still at 1-1. “We arrived at this game short of energy, physically and mentally. This happens. Meanwhile, Lazio are experiencing a moment of incredible form. “We are sorry we lost a title, but we still have many competitions to play for in the next five months. There is anger, but crying over it does not solve the problems. “We did not lose because of the front three, since we conceded the [second and third] goals after I added a midfielder,” Sarri told a news conference.
