The former Chairman of Trade Union Congress (TUC), Cross River State Council, Comrade Clarkson Otu, has condemned the state security architecture. Speaking with DAILY POST on Thursday in Calabar via phone, Otu condemned the recent kidnap of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) Chairman, Comrade Ben Ukpepi. He described the incident as unfortunate, blaming it on poor security architecture of the state government and security agencies. “I speak as a Cross Riverian, I speak as a stakeholder and I speak as Labour leader, it is very unfortunate thing, what has happened is very unfortunate. “Not just because Comrade Ukpepi is NLC Chairman but for every Cross Riverian or Nigerian that has misfortune of fallen into the hands of kidnappers, it is a very unfortunate thing. “It was something that we were not part of. It was unfortunate that the security situation has deteriorated to this level. When the Commissioner of Police came to the state, at a courtesy visit to the Governor, he made a remark that the security in the state was very much improved but what do we see today. “It is very unfortunate and we are not happy at all. About if the kidnappers have put a call across to the family, I am not aware and have no knowledge of such.” On how to curb the menace, the ex-TUC Chairman said “It is the duty of government to leave up to her responsibility of securing life and property. “I know that things are hard but this level of criminality, which has come and is not going away is not a good thing. Government should leave up to its responsibility and do the needful with a view to improving the security situation in the state,” he stated.
