The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, (SERAP) has reacted to the Federal Government’s order to take over Sowore’s case DAILY POST had reported that the Attorney-General of the Federation, AGF, and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, on Friday directed the Department of State Service, DSS, to hands-off the prosecution of Omoyele Sowore, convener of RevolutionNow Movement. Malami ordered the DSS to forward the case file in respect of the charge pending against Sowore before the Federal High Court in Abuja, to his office. Reacting, SERAP in a statement on its official Twitter page said, the decision was not a take over because the AGF filed Sowore’s case, adding that the activist was subjected to a 4-hour interrogation on Thursday. It said the interrogation pertained to Sowore’s alleged links with the proscribed Boko Haram sect, IPOB and IMN. The statement said, ”In spite of the directive of the AGF to take over the case the SSS subjected Sowore to a 4-hour interrogation yesterday (12/12/19). The entire interrogation pertained to Sowore’s alleged links with the proscribed Boko Haram sect, IPOB and IMN which he vehemently denied. ”At Sowore’s instance a member of the legal defence team Mr. Abubakar Marshal witnessed the marathon interrogation. The plan of the SSS is to charge Sowore with terrorism in line with the unsubstituted allegations of presidential media aides. ”In view of the foregoing we urge the AGF to file a nolle prosequi motion without any further delay to end the macabre dance which has exposed the country to avoidable embarrassment.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
