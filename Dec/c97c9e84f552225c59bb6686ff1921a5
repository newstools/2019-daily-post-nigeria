A 41-year-old old auto dealer, Frank Ehigbor, who allegedly defrauded his customer of N2 million appeared before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Ehigbor, who resides at No. 3, Rasheed Abiara St., Ikotun, Lagos State, is facing charges of stealing and obtaining goods under false pretences. However, he pleaded not guilty to the two-count charge preferred against him. The prosecutor, Sgt. Michael Unah, told the court that the defendant committed the offence in December 2018 at Egbeda, a Lagos suburb. Unah said the defendant collected one Equinox Jeep worth N2 million from the complainant, one Mrs Esther Ogieabu, with a promise that he would help her sell it. The prosecutor said that the defendant stole from the complainant by diverting the N2 million, being the proceeds from the sale of the jeep, into his personal use. He said “All attempts made by the complainant to retrieve the jeep or the money from the defendant proved abortive.” The prosecutor said that the offences violated Sections 287 and 314 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015, (revised). NAN reports that Section 287 stipulates three years’ jail term for stealing, while Section 314 provides 15 years’ imprisonment for obtaining under false pretences. The chief magistrate, Mr A. A. Fashola, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N200, 000 with two sureties in like sum. Fashola ordered that the surety must be gainfully employed with evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. He adjourned the case until Jan. 21, 2020 for mention.
