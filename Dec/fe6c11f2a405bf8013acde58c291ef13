Manchester City assistant coach, Mikel Arteta, is very interested in taking over at Arsenal, but wants guarantees from the board, before engaging in further talks, according to the UK Sun. The Gunners are looking for a replacement for Unai Emery, who was fired at the end of last month. Freddie Ljunberg has been installed on a temporary basis. Arsenal are still on the hunt for a permanent successor to Emery, with as many as 10 candidates likely to be interviewed. Arteta is however the favourite to land the job. But he is seeking assurances over the nature of the project at Arsenal, before going any further. The Spaniaard wants a guarantee over what is on offer and their plans for the club.
