Arsenal playmaker, Mesut Ozil, has reacted to his side’s Premier League 3-1 victory over West Ham United at the London Stadium on Monday night. Arsenal went in 1-0 down at half-time, thanks to Angelo Ogbonna’s deflected header. But Gabriel Martinelli fired the Gunners level, before Nicolas Pepe and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang added two more goals to give Freddie Ljunberg’s all three points against the hosts. Reacting to Arsenal’s win over West Ham, Ozil in a tweet on his official Twitter handle, admitted that there was still a lot of work Arsenal needed to do going forward despite beating Mauel Pellegrini’s men. He wrote: “Finally a reason to smile again … a little bit! “That winning feeling is back. How I’ve missed you!! But of course we all know that there’s still a lot of work in front of us #YaGunnersYa #M1Ö #COYG @Arsenal @premierleague.” Arsenal will now take on Manchester City in their next Premier League fixture on Sunday at the Emirates Stadium.
