Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said he is not afraid of getting sacked. United are ninth in the Premier League table, following their worst start to a season since 1988. The Red Devils host Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, having won just four games out of 14 fixtures this season. Spurs, who are being coached by Solskjaer’s predecessor at United, Jose Mourinho, have their last three games. Speaking ahead of the clash, Solskjaer told reporters on Tuesday: “It doesn’t make me concerned. “I’m just focusing on my job and that’s doing as well as it can, looking forward to the next game. “Football is a results business. We’re not happy, we know we can do better and we are working hard. “The work is always geared on us improving but we’re not getting all the results we’ve deserved.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
