Carlo Ancelotti has been sacked as manager of Napoli on Tuesday, after their 4-0 victory over Genk. The win confirmed the Serie A team’s place in the Champions League knockout stage. “Napoli has decided to revoke the position of first-team coach from Carlo Ancelotti. “The relationship of friendship, esteem and mutual respect between the club, its president Aurelio De Laurentiis and Carlo Ancelotti remain intact,” a club statement read. Gennaro Gattuso, who was fired by AC Milan at the end of last season, has emerged as top contender to replace Ancelotti. Ancelotti himself has been mentioned as candidate for the permanent job at Arsenal.
