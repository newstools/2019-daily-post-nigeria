Opeyemi, the wife of Omoyele Sowore, convener of RevolutionNow Movement, has raised alarm over threat to her husband. She called on the United States, US, government to intervene in the predicament of her husband, who was re-arrested by operatives of the Department of State Services, DSS, in an Abuja Federal High Court on Friday. Addressing a press briefing in the US over the weekend, Opeyemi said her husband’s life might be in great danger unless the U.S. government intervenes. Opeyemi insisted that Sowore’s re-arrest was a show of lawlessness and a gross disregard for the rule of law. She said: “After over 125 days of my husband being in detention illegally, he was finally set free. “He got to speak to myself and the children. For the first time, we got to see his eyes when we spoke to him. “I haven’t told them yet that he was rearrested. I was truly shaken to my core what I witnessed this morning. I was woken up by 4 a.m. what I call truly outrageous and a gross disregard for the rule of law. “My husband was strangled and forcefully removed from the courtroom. The judge had to run and hide for her own safety. How do I tell my children who, after 125 days, have for the very first time spoken to their dad and seen his face that he is again in detention and he may not be coming home for Christmas? How do they understand this? Where do they go from here?” “My 10-year-old (son), one of the things he wants for Christmas is for his dad to be home for Christmas. Christmas is only a few days away. What do I tell him when I leave here and get home? “I’m truly afraid for his life and at this point, I believe the only way to bring him home is with the help of the United States.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
