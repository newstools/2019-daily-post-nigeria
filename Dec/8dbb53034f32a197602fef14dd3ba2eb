Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has said that no player can replace Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid. Ronaldo spent nine years at Madrid, where he clashed with Messi during El Clasico fixtures, before joining Juventus in the summer of 2018. Ahead of Wednesday’s home game against the Los Blancos, Messi was asked if Hazard could replace Ronaldo at the Bernabeu. He told Marca: “Hazard has a lot of quality. He is a different football player who can unbalance [defences], but I think he is different to Cristiano, with different characteristics. “It is very difficult to replace Cristiano, but Hazard is also a great player.” The Argentine superstar also opened up on Madrid’s tactical setup for their home and away matches. “When we play at the Bernabeu, many more spaces are generated. They attack us more because they have the obligation as the host team and people push them for that. “At the Camp Nou, they play another type of match, sitting a little further back, they are closer together and hit on the counter-attack because they have very fast players upfront. “At the Bernabeu, we play 90 minutes equally. Here the game becomes more locked and is more complicated,” Messi added. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
