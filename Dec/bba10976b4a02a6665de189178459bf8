Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has a ‘break clause’ in his contract, that could see him leave the club this summer, the Daily Mail reports. Guardiola signed an extension to his contract last year, keeping him at City until 2021. If he sees out the full contract he will have been at City for five seasons, longer than he stayed at either Barcelona or Bayern Munich . The new deal included an agreement that he could leave City at the end of this season. City are however confident Guardiola will stay for another season and see out his contract. After a trophyless first season, Guardiola led City to a silverware haul comprising seven out of eight of the domestic trophies available, including back-to-back titles and last season’s unprecedented treble.
