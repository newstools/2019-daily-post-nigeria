Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State has said that carnival is a business venture in Nigeria as at today. Ayade who spoke on the essence of the Bikers parade stated that apart from the Biker parade spicing up the event, the ceremony is organized to bring everybody together on a tripod. “Before now the carnival was about entertainment, but now we are moving into a business. This is why we are introducing different contents that can at least bring the rich and wealthy ones to Calabar”. Speaking on the theme “humanity” the state Governor stated that the number of Bikers that came out to participate in the parade goes a long way to tell that the carnival has come to stay. On why he invited the bikers Ayade said, “They are here to deepen and spend money in Calabar because we want to bring economy into the carnival”. The Governor urged the people to have humanity at the back of their minds as they go about enjoying the carnival, “So, let people enjoy themselves and have humanity at the back of their mind”. “Even in this nature let them remember that the theme for this year is Humanity. Love for fellow human beings, providing a shoulder for a weaker person and the vulnerable to lean on.” The Governor charged those participating in the carnival Calabar Bikers parade to at all times offer their shoulders to vulnerable fellow countrymen who are in dire need of a shoulder to lean on.
