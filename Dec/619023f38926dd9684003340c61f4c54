The lawmaker representing Egbeda/Ona Ara, Oyo State in the House of Representatives, Hon. Akin Alabi, has reacted to the chaotic scene witnessed at the Federal High Court in Abuja, where the trial of Omoyele Sowore was disrupted by DSS operatives, who rearrested him on Friday. Alabi described the incident as desecration of the judiciary. “The DSS will have to explain why Sowore was rearrested. And the reason has to be HUGE. “We just debated on the floor yesterday about separation of powers but this is a desecration of the judiciary. No matter whose side you are on, this cannot be right in anyway,” he tweeted. He added: “I can’t find words to describe this show of shame. Except Sowore is about to bomb a shopping mall or something that extreme, which I’m sure he is not, this is unacceptable in a democracy.” Sowore and Adebayo Bakare, aka, Mandate have been standing trial for treasonable felony with the hashtag, #RevolutionNow since August 3, but were initially released yesterday.
