Police said, “further information about the suspect revealed that he is also a big time dealer of illicit drugs”; adding that “his cult group always uses his abode as their meeting point from where they do plan how to carry out their notorious activities.” “On receiving the information, the DPO Enugada division mobilized his men to the scene where the suspect was promptly arrested, while some of his accomplices escaped. About 300 wraps of weeds suspected to be Indian hemp was recovered from him,” Oyeyemi said.
