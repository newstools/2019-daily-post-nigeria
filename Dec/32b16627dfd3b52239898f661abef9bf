Arsenal playmaker, Mesut Ozil has reacted to his side’s Premier League 1-1 draw with Bournemouth on Thursday. Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang equalised in the second-half for Mikel Arteta’s side after Dan Gosling had opened the scoring for Bournemouth to ensure both teams shared a point each. Ozil, in a tweet on his official Twitter page, said the Gunners were ‘unlucky’ not to have got the victory against Bournemouth. “Unlucky to not get the victory,” Ozil wrote on Twitter. “But many positive things to take away from the game. Let’s trust the process #M1Ö #COYG.” Ozil will now hope to lead Arsenal to victory when they take on Chelsea this weekend in their next Premier League fixture.
