Paul Pogba missed Manchester United’s training session on Monday morning, ahead of their game on New Year’s Day against Arsenal. However, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was still handed a massive boost, as Eric Bailly returned. Pogba appeared as a substitute in recent matches against Watford and Newcastle, but was left out of their 2-0 victory over Burnley on Saturday. The France midfielder attended a charity match in France on Sunday, but returned in time to report to the Carrington HQ on Monday morning. Scott McTominay, Axel Tuanzebe and Ashley Young also weren’t involved in the session. United however stated on their website that: “Their absences from training on Monday morning does not necessarily mean they are unavailable for action.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
