Former Everton and West Ham United striker, Tony Cottee has criticised Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard for the tactics he used during the Blues’ 2-0 defeat against Southampton in the Premier League on Thursday. Southampton shocked Lampard’s men at Stamford Bridge, thanks to goals from Michael Obafemi and Nathan Redmond. But Cottee now believes that Lampard got his team selection wrong for not playing three defenders at the defence and also playing only Tammy Abraham up front against the visitors. “I don’t want to be too critical of Frank because he’s a young manager and he’s learning his job,” Cottee was quoted by Metro UK as saying after the match. “But he might look back and think he shouldn’t have played three at the back. It limited the options and meant Tammy [Abraham] was playing up on his own. “He didn’t play badly but there was no support. It caused Chelsea problems. He [Frank] changed it up at half-time but it was very flat. The atmosphere was very flat. “It was very quiet in the stadium and Chelsea never got going. You can’t take anything away from Southampton because they did a great job.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
