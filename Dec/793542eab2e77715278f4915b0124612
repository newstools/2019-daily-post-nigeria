Mr. Charles Enya, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who filed a suit seeking a constitutional amendment to allow President Muhammadu Buhari and governors to seek for third-term in office, has withdrawn the matter. He said the withdrawal was to allow for further consultations. DAILY POST reports that Enya in a suit no. FHC/AI/CS/90/19, had approached the Federal High Court in Abakiliki seeking for the amendment of section 137(1) (b) and 182 (1) (b) of the Nigerian constitution to allow for a third term for the President and the state Governors. The counsel to the applicant, Iheanachor Agboti told the court he was withdrawing the suit on the instruction of his client, Enya. “I have the instruction of my Client to withdraw the suit so as to allow further consultation”, he told the Court. Ruling on the application, the presiding judge, Justice Akintayo Aluko, granted the application and therefore struck out the suit. “Upon the application of the learned counsel for the applicant for the withdrawal of this suit, I say may the case be struck out”, Justice Aluko ruled. Recall that the National Publicity Secretary of APC, Lanre Issa-Onilu, in a press statement, threatened legal action against Enya. “The president said history would not be fair to members if the APC collapses after his second term. What better proof is required of the President’s resolve to abide by the constitution on term limit? “The Party is, however, by this statement sending a strong signal to such other busybodies like Charles Enya who may be contemplating testing the resolve of our government on our mission to work for the best for our country to be ready to face the law.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
