The Nigeria Police Force have demanded for immediate establishment of law guiding the operation of vigilante in Jigawa State. State Police Commissioner, Usman Sule Gomna, disclosed this when he received members of the state assembly who were on a courtesy call to his office. He explained that the role vigilante groups are playing with regard to maintaining security can never be emphasized. “Vigilante personnel are playing a key role in providing security in a society, so there is need for the establishment of law that will protect their operation in a society,” he said. “Although, Jigawa is one of the most peaceful states in the country, there is lingering seasonal farmers/herdsmen conflict in the state,” he added. He called for collaborative efforts by the lawmakers to end the problem. Earlier, Speaker of the State House Assembly, Idiris Garba Jahun, said the meeting was aimed at establishing the cordial relationship between the police force and lawmakers in view to curtailing farmers, herdsmen conflict and other security challenges in the state.
