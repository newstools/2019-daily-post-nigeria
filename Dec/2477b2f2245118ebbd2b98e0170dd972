Arsenal interim manager, Freddie Ljungberg, has said Nicolas Pepe will be given a “fair chance” to win back his place in the side, after he was benched for the 2-2 draw against Norwich City on Sunday. Ljungberg took charge of his first game after replacing Unai Emery on Friday. The Gunners went behind on two occasions at Carrow Road, but Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted twice to salvage a draw. Pepe was left on the bench, as Ljungberg opted to bring on Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli as his attacking substitutions in the second half. “I haven’t had that word with them but for me that’s how it works,” Ljungberg told Sky Sports. “I’ve looked, of course. I’ve been here [in the first team] for three months, last year I was the manager of the Under-23s, so I saw every game of the first team. “So of course, I have an opinion about how we can play and players. “But I try to see it just like that, everybody has a fair chance. “What I see in training and games, that’s what I’m going to judge it on.” When asked directly about Pepe’s omission against Norwich, Ljungberg replied: “Pepe’s a very good player. “But like I said, I try to look at what’s being done in training and what I see every day, and that’s how I judge it.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
