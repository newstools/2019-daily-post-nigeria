The United States has called on the Nigerian Government to respect the rule of law, judicial independence, political and media freedom. The US State Department made the call while reacting to the re-arrest of the convener of RevolutionNow Movement, Omoyele Sowore on Friday. Recall that the DSS operatives on Friday allegedly chased out lawyers from the courtroom and attacked journalists after which they re-arrested Sowore. Following the invasion of the courtroom, the trial judge, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu adjourned the matter till February 11, 12 and 13 for definite hearing. Reacting via its official Twitter page @StateDRL, the State Department said, “We are deeply concerned that Sowore has been re-detained in Nigeria shortly after a court ordered he be released on bail. “Respect for rule of law, judicial independence, political and media freedom, and due process are key tenets of democracy.” Meanwhile, the Department of State Services (DSS) has said it re-arrested the convener of RevolutionNow Movement, Omoyele Sowore because he ‘resorted’ to act against the law. DSS spokesperson, Peter Afunanya said, Sowore had shortly after being released from custody, addressed a group of persons, reassuring them of his continued intention to create anarchy in the country.
