Arsenal are expected to confirm Mikel Arteta as their new manager, before their trip to Everton in the Premier League on Saturday, the UK Mirror reports. Arteta has agreed a three-and-a-half years contract with the Gunners. The 37-year-old will earn £5million annually at the Emirates, the same wages Unai Emery was on. Arsenal will also pay a seven-figure sum in compensation to Manchester City, to secure Arteta’s release. He is still expected to travel to Oxford for City’s Carabao Cup final clash on Wednesday morning, but he has the club’s blessing to move on.
