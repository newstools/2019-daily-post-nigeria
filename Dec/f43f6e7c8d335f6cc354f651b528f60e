Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State has told journalists to feel free to criticise him and his government as he has no problem with criticism. He said during a dinner with journalists at the Government House Tuesday night that he actually needed constructive criticism to guide him in his efforts to deliver good governance. The governor told the hundreds of journalists who turned up at the Banquet Hall of the Government House for the dinner: “I like critical media. Don’t be afraid that your criticism will destroy our relationship. “Let’s operate with sincerity of purpose, knowing that we are working to build a better Adamawa. Always try to advance issues that will be beneficial to mankind.” The governor who had been on television for a media chat earlier in the day, said he had dedicated the day to be with journalists because he holds them in high esteem. “I value you, I love you and I respect all of you. That’s why I have called you for this dinner, so that we can sit in a relaxed atmosphere and socialize, and to end the year on a very happy note.” The Governor’s End of Year Dinner with Journalists was attended by media chiefs and reporters of local newspapers, television and radio houses, as well as correspondents of national media houses operating in Adamawa State. The state Chairman of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), Mr Ishaka Dedan, who gave the vote of thanks, expressed gratitude to the governor for honouring the union. “We feel privileged that you have chosen us from among the professions for this dinner,” Mr Dedan said.
