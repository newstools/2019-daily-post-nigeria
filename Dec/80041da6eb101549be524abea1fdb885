The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has claimed President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration has become a house of commotion. In a statement on Wednesday, the National Secretary of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan, said Buhari has handed over the control of the government to a cabal. PDP was reacting to a statement by Aisha Buhari, wife of the president, accusing Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, of taking instructions from Mamman Daura, the president’s nephew and undermining her office. “It is indeed appalling that under President Buhari, our once productive and highly organized Presidency has been bastardized and reduced to Kunle Bamtefa’s soap opera, Fuji House of Commotion. “Instead of governance, the Buhari Presidency has continued to serve Nigerians and the international community with tragicomedies that make mockery of leadership. “Nigerians can now further see why nothing works under the Buhari presidency; why the administration has remained shambolic and plagued with policy somersault and executive recklessness; why our economy has remained comatose and why our nation has been dangerously drifting to the brinks under President Buhari’s watch,” Ologbondiyan said Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
