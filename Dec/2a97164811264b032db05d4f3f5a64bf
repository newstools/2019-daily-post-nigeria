Malami made the disclosure while addressing journalists at the Federal Ministry of Justice headquarters in Abuja, on Thursday. He said he was yet to receive a formal briefing on Adoke’s arrival to the country Adoke said: “I think there are multiple judicial cases pending before the judiciary and against the background of subsisting principle of the law, I wouldn’t want to comment one way or the other in that respect or direction because I cannot be talking in preemptive sense or preempting the judicial position as it relates to the matter. “I am equally not in a position to confirm the statement relating to the arrival of the former Attorney General in Nigeria as I have not been officially briefed in that respect. Until I am formally briefed I am not in a position to comment on it, one way or the other”. Adoke was arrested and detained in Dubai by the Interpol since November 11.
