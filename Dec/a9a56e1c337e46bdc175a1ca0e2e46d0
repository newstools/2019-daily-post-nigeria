The Ekiti state commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) Mr. Solomon Iyamu, has confirmed the arrest of two herders and detained about 100 cows. The NSCDC boss said the arrest of the suspects was made possible through a joint operation of the Agro Rangers Unit of the command, Nigeria Army, Police, Ekiti State Anti-Grazing Agency and men of Vigilante Group of Nigeria (GVN) The operation which he said lasted for about six hours took place at Ago Aduloju and Ogbese axis of Ise-Orun and Gbonyin local government areas of the state. He disclosed that two herders of Fulani origin who were arrested will be charged to court as soon as investigation is completed on the matter, while about 100 hundred cows detained during the operation are currently at the premises of the corps in Ado-Ekiti. The Ekiti NSCDC commandant explained that there have been a series of complaints by farmers, especially herders migrating from neighbouring states to Ekiti in search of fresh pastures for their animals. According to him, “the herders who were discovered uprooting tubers to feed their animals and also destroy bans and other valuables, they were arrested when they were destroying some farms along Ado/Ijan road. Iyamu appealed to farmers in Ekiti State not to take laws into their hands and always report any perceived herder’s threat to the men of Agro Rangers Unit of the Corps for prompt assistance. He, however, commended the joint operations and thanked them for the work carried out, urging them to work more for the unity of Nigeria. He commended the Commandant General of the NSCDC for his laudable achievement geared towards solving farmers, herders clashes in the country which he said has given birth to Agro-Rangers Unit and safeguard investments of farmers as well that of herders in Nigeria.
