Former Arsenal star, Charlie Nicholas, has said defending Premier League champions Manchester City will defeat rivals Manchester United in Sunday’s derby. United are currently 11 points adrift of league leaders Liverpool and face City at the Etihad. Nicholas has also backed his former club Arsenal to return to winning ways at West Ham, while he cannot see Liverpool slipping up at Bournemouth. On the Manchester Derby, he told Sky Sports: “Does United’s victory over Spurs signify the turning of a corner under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer? “We’ve said that so many times, but we’ve been proven wrong on every occasion. “City have the fire, the burning desire back in their bellies, we saw that in the victory at Burnley, and it is for that reason why the United revival will be short-lived. “It will be a blue day in Manchester.” On West Ham vs Arsenal, he said: “These are two teams in a right mess. I saw more fight from Arsenal at Norwich, but it was a disaster defensively and a crazy team selection from Freddie Ljungberg. “West Ham will be up for it, as will Arsenal – they have a chance of catching up and getting back in the top six. “A bit of momentum can get you there. They have class up top, but West Ham are not showing a lot at the moment.” Nicholas, speaking on Everton vs Chelsea, added: “Marco Silva’s immediate replacement may be a temporary one, but it will be one that should give Everton a much-needed lift. “I am not convinced by Chelsea’s defence, they looked uncomfortable at times against Aston Villa. “Things haven’t gone Everton’s way under Silva, but they are a team of scrappers, and I see them battling their way to three points.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
