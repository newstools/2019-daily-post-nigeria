Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp has reacted to midfielder, Takumi Minamino joining the club. DAILY POST had earlier reported on Thursday that Liverpool have completed the signing of Takumi Minamino from Red Bull Salzburg. But Klopp has now described Minamino as a ‘clever’ player, adding that the 24-year-old Japanese international will bolster his attacking options at Anfield. “This is fabulous news – a wonderful signing,” Klopp told Liverpool’s official website on Thursday. “We are really, really happy about this. “‘Our supporters have had the chance to see him close up recently so I don’t need to sing too loudly about his qualities as they are already known. “Takumi is a very quick, very clever player, he finds space between the lines. He is brave with the ball but also brave without the ball – a proper team player. He makes the best of himself for the benefit of others. “His Champions League experience is a big bonus and coming from the club and organisation he does, we know he’ll be well-coached, used to an elite environment and had all the right experiences.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
