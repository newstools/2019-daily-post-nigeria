Former Arsenal star, Paul Merson has urged Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard to prioritise a move for a centre forward and two defenders in the January transfer window. According to Merson, Lampard needs another striker to support Tammy Abraham, more experienced centre half if Antonio Rudiger isn’t going to be 100 per cent for the rest of the season and a left-back as well. He, however, believes the three players will help Lampard’s men to qualify for next season’s UEFA Champions League. “If Chelsea does the right deals in January they can book their ticket to a top-four finish now their transfer ban has been lifted,” Merson told Starsport. “They are right in the hunt already but they have teams breathing down their necks now and the youngsters could do with some help. “They need a centre forward to take the load off Tammy Abraham for a start. He’s done brilliantly but you can’t rely on him alone for the rest of the season. “I think Olivier Giroud will go. He’s hardly played and isn’t getting any younger. So they will need to replace him. “They might need a more experienced centre half if Antonio Rudiger isn’t going to be 100 per cent for the rest of the season – and they need a left-back as well. “But they don’t need major surgery. I don’t think they will spend big. Frank Lampard was a hard-working player. He will only want to buy that type of player. “He won’t want to be paying £80m for a superstar who just does enough in training and doesn’t pull his weight in matches. “Chelsea’s kids have done well but there are times when they will need to be taken out of the team. Buy the right three players and I think they’re guaranteed to make the Champions League.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
