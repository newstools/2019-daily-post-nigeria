Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has said that his side weren’t committed enough, following their 3-1 defeat at Everton on Saturday. The Toffees got off to a perfect start under Duncan Ferguson, after Richarlison headed in for 1-0. Dominic Calvert-Lewin then netted brace either side of Mateo Kovacic’s fine finish. “We gave them three goals. I suppose the first goal will be seen as a good goal from their point of view but we know Richarlison’s good in the air, he scores a lot of goals and we didn’t deal with it. “Then when you give Everton that goal to hang on to, we gave ourselves a problem. We didn’t create enough chances and we didn’t want to shoot enough, we dribble into their box and we try and beat someone else. We need to shoot more. “And then the other two goals were just really poor from our point of view. You dominate a game with possession, you play a team that play with a lot of fighting spirit in the moment when they’re fighting for their interim manager and for themselves and we’ve got to do more. “I think we matched them on the work rate. Work rate is one thing, I expect us to match everyone in this league on that but sometimes physical contact is another. “So, if you’re not going to win headers or balls that bounce down and you’re not going to go through the ball and the man a little bit then at places like Goodison, especially, it’s going to be really hard to come and win,” Lampard told BT Sport.
