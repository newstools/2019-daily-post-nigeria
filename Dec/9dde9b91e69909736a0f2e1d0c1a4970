Manchester United legend, Ryan Giggs has slammed Anthony Martial over the Frenchman’s poor performance in the Red Devils’ 1-1 Premier League draw against Everton at Old Trafford on Sunday. Ole Gunner Solskjaer’s side had the opportunity to take all three points but settled for a frustrating stalemate against the Toffees. Giggs noted that Martial looked ‘casual’ and ‘lethargic’ as the club were searching for the winning goal. “He is talented, and he’s not a bad kid, but the problem he has is that he looks lethargic all the time. “He looks casual, as if he’s not bothered,” he said on the Premier League’s matchday coverage via Goal.com. “When it comes off, and he’s doing brilliant things, you say it just comes naturally. “But when it’s not, you think: he’s not running, he’s not trying, he’s not working hard enough, he’s not holding the ball up.” Giggs added that the Frenchman’s position could be under threat during the forthcoming matches, particularly with young graduate Mason Greenwood finding the net in recent games for the club. “With Mason coming on and doing that, getting in positions to score goals, he [Martial] is going to be under pressure, because he’s not giving you anything defensively and he’s not giving you anything offensively either,” he added.
