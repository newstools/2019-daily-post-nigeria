Former Nigeria President, Olusegun Obasanjo, has described Kaduna state Governor, Nasir el-Rufai, as one of the best persons to work with. Obasanjo stated this on Wednesday, when he paid a private visit to El-Rufai at the government house. El-Rufai served under Obasanjo, first as Director-General, Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) and later as minister for Federal Capital Territory (FCT). “He is one of the best persons to work with; El-Rufai is a near-genius,” Obasanjo said. “We need a character like this, a man that you know where you stand with him. Any job given to him will be well done. “I made women matter in my government. He has done the same in Kaduna. He is a very good learner.” Obasanjo described his visit as homecoming, saying he is a “son of the soil”. The former president built his first house in Makera area of the city between 1959 and 1967, when he served at the Mogadishu battalion of the Nigerian army in Kaduna.
