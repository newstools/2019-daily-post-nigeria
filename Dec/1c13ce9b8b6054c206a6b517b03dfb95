Manchester United missed out on signing Erling Haaland, after refusing to meet the demands of his representatives, according to SportsMail. Haaland’s £18million move from RB Salzburg to Borussia Dortmund was confirmed on Sunday. It came as a shock to many, as the 19-year-old was heavily linked with United. It is understood that Dortmund have agreed to give his agent Mino Raiola and father Alf Inge Haaland a significant share of Haaland’s future sales value. These were terms that the Red Devils refused to agree to. United were so desperate to land the player, that manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer who worked with Haaland at Molde, flew to Salzburg on a private jet earlier this month to convince the player and his representatives. Solskjaer will now turn his attention to other targets as the January window opens on Wednesday.
