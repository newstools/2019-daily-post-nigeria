Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho has backed British fighter, Anthony Joshua to beat Mexican-American fighter, Andy Ruiz Jr in their heavyweight rematch. Ruiz stunned the boxing world when he knocked Joshua down four times before stopping him in the seventh round of their heavyweight world title fight in June. The 30-year-old will put his three belts back on the line in the rematch when they clash in the desert of Saudi Arabia tonight. Speaking ahead of his side’s Premier League clash against Burnley on Saturday evening, Mourinho, who insisted that he was invited to watch Joshua’s heavyweight rematch with Ruiz Jr by Saudi Prince Mohammad bin Salman, was quoted by the Sun UK as saying: “That’s the only bad thing for me in getting the job at Tottenham – that I’m not going to be there. “I was invited by the Prince to be there, but I prefer to be in the match against Burnley.” Pushed as to whether he expected a Joshua victory, Mourinho replied: “I’m not an expert. I just love the sport. I like Anthony very much because he’s a great kid and I hope he wins. But in sport you can lose. So let’s see.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
