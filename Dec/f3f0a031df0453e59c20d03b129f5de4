Everton manager, Marco Silva, on Tuesday, confirmed that his side will be without two key players when they take on Premier League leaders, Liverpool on Wednesday night at Anfield due to injuries. Silva’s men head to the game following a 2-1 defeat to Leicester City in their last Premier League encounter on Sunday. Speaking at his pre-match press conference, Silva was quoted by Echo Liverpool as saying: “Coleman [Seamus] tried this morning again, but he’s not in the conditions to be fit for the match against Liverpool. “Delph [Fabian] is not training in this moment with the team. Let’s see over the next few days how they will be.” Silva added: “Theo will be ok for tomorrow. “Like you know he was sick, but he worked the last two sessions with the team and will be in the conditions to be in the squad list.” Meanwhile, Liverpool stars, Andy Robertson and Mohamed Salah appear to have recovered from the ankle issues that kept them out of international duty some few days ago. The kick-off time for the match is 9:15pm. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
