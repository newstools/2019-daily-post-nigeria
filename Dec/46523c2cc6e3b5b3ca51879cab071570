A former lawmaker representing Abia North in the upper legislative chamber, Senator Emma Nwaka, has advised the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the last election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, to shelve the idea of running in the 2023 presidential election. The PDP chieftain said the ticket should be zoned to no other region than the South East. The former Abia State Chairman of the PDP, however, told the Sun that the Igbo must work hard to get the presidency. On the rumour that Atiku Abubakar, has started warning up again for 2023, Nwaka said, “It’s still speculation. I don’t know if he wants to run again, but I think the proper thing will be for power to shift to no other zone than the Southeast. “I’m sure we don’t lack men and women who can do well as Nigeria president. Zoning is in PDP constitution and I don’t see our party going back on that. “What is right is that power should shift to Southeast in 2023 for equity, peace and justice.” He continued, “Power is not given on a platter of gold; you go for power. We are not saying that power should be donated to us simply because we are from Southeast. “We must synergise with other ethnic nationalities. Politics is all about dialogue and compromise and not what is currently happening in the country where a particular section of the country has virtually taken over the country. “Look at the security architecture of Nigeria; the Southeast and South-South zones have almost been tactfully excluded. Those in power now use force and bullet to scare the electorate and declare results.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
