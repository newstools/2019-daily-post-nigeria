Apathy expressed in low turnout of voters was evident in Adamawa State Saturday, the day scheduled for election of chairmen and councillors for the 21 local government areas of the state. The election started behind schedule in Yola and its environs, and as the day wore on, it became evident that voters were not enthusiastic, as only a handful turned up at polling units visited. There was restriction to vehicular movement, but commercial motorcycles defied the order and found their way around, conveying residents who went about their businesses as if the election was a no-issue. Sen Aishatu Ahmed Binani, who got into the Senate in May for the Adamawa Central District under All Progressives Congress (APC), complained about the low turnout. Speaking of her impression of the poll after casting her ballot in Yola North LGA, Binani said, “So far so good, except that the turnout is low compared to our experience during the presidential, National Assembly and governorship elections. The turnout was far better.” She, however, said the council poll was peaceful and it should be commended. There were allegations of irregularities levelled by some APC members in some LGAs as this report was being concluded Saturday evening, but it was difficult to place premium on such allegations, as they were not substantiated nor confirmed by any authority. Voting in the council election, which officially started at 8 am, ended officially at 2pm when restriction to movement by residents was also lifted. The PDP, which forms the government in the state, is expected to do well in the council election, but the main opposition APC is strong and is also expected to put up a good fight.
