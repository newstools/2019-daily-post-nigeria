Saudi Arabia’s Ambassador to Nigeria, Adnan Bostaji, says his country will continue to offer humanitarian assistance to Nigeria especially in the health Sector. Bostaji made the pledge in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Abuja. The envoy said that in 2020, the embassy would take more of its already existing health campaign, in the area of eye treatment and eye operation to other parts of the country so that every Nigerian would benefit. “Based on the kingdom’s interest to do more and aid the Nigerian citizens in humanitarian activities, the medical campaign has been held in Nasarawa and Oyo states. “The bottomline is to treat eye patients with glaucoma and cataract and to do a number of operations. “The Kingdom does not differentiate between ethnic groups of Nigeria. “It gives everybody on the same footing and that is why very soon, we will move over to some South Eastern states to show that the Kingdom is very objective. “We are expecting the next campaign in February and March and that would be focusing on the South Eastern states. “The reason it has not been done yet is because the embassy has to collaborate with state governments to see which states have the proper hospitals to handle the operations and medical campaign,” Bostaji said.
