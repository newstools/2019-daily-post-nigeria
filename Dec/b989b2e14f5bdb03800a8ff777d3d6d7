Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard has issued a strong warning to his players after their shocking 2-0 defeat to Southampton on Boxing Day. Lampard was left frustrated once again as his Chelsea side fell at home to Saints on Thursday. Michael Obafemi opened the scoring for the Saints in the first half, before Nathan Redmond secured a vital three points for the visitors. The defeat means Chelsea’s advantage over Tottenham in the race for the Premier League top four is now back to three points. “It’s a similar story, it felt the same as recent games,” Lampard told Amazon Prime. “You have to credit Southampton for that, they were organised and they got their goals on the counter. “But we need to be better at breaking teams down, simple as that. We need to do more. “I think we’ve got enough to be better than we were today, and what we’ve been at home. “It needs to be a quick learning process now for us. There’s a difference between going to Tottenham in a game that opens up because they have a go at you, and being able to do things with the space that opens.” “But when there’s no space, and it’s close, that’s a different question, and we’re not answering that.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
