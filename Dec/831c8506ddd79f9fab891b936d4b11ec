The Football Association have rejected Tottenham Hotspurs’ appeal against Heung-Min Son’s red card, during their 2-0 defeat to Chelsea on Sunday, Sky Sports reports. Son was sent off in the second half of the game, when VAR showed him kicking out at Antonio Rudiger in retaliation to being fouled. The FA’s decision to uphold the red card means the South Korean will miss Spurs’ next three matches against Brighton (Boxing Day), Norwich (Saturday) and Southampton (New Year’s Day). It was the third red card for Son in 2019, as he was also sent off for pushing Jefferson Lerma at Bournemouth last season, then for a tackle on Everton’s Andre Gomes in November that broke the midfielder’s ankle. Spurs also appealed against both dismissals, winning the latter. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
