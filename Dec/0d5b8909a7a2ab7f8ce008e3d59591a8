Arsenal’s head coach, Mikel Arteta, has expressed his confidence that he can win over the fans of “the biggest football club in England”, after a difficult few months at the Emirates. Arteta was appointed as Unai Emery’s successor earlier this month and oversaw a 1-1 draw with Bournemouth for his first game in charge. He faces a sterner test against rivals Chelsea in the club’s final game of 2019 on Sunday. Arteta has now outlined his plans on how to recapture the glory days in North London. “We need to connect the team with the fans again,” he told Sky Sports. “I sense in the last few seasons there has been a big disconnection, and we are losing a lot of power. “I said before that they are probably the most important part of the football club, and we need to get them on board, we need to convince them, and we need to be able to transmit what we are trying to do with the team. “Hopefully on Sunday they will start to see some things where they think: ‘OK, I take this on board, I start to like a few things!’ The process is going to take some time, but I hope we can start to engage them again. “I think things happened in the last two seasons that have a strong say on the situation. If the fans can see an identity close to what they are used to seeing with Arsenal, they will be on board. “There are some non-negotiables. The demands we put on the team, the commitment, the energy we put in, that dominance. “We are the biggest football club in England, and we have to play a little bit with that arrogance, that belief. This stadium has to create fear again. I used to hate coming here as an opponent, and we need to use that power.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
