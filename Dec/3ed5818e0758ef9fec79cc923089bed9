British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, on Tuesday, called for resistance to calls for UK break up. Johnson was making a reference to Scottish nationalist lawmakers, who are demanding a new independence referendum, Reuters reports. “Most honorable members in this House believe we should resist the calls of those who would break up the United Kingdom”, Reuters quoted him as saying. “And as the parliament of the United Kingdom, we should politely and respectfully defend that partnership and that union”. Britain set a hard deadline of December 2020 on Tuesday to reach a new trade deal with the EU, betting that the prospect of another Brexit cliff-edge would force Brussels to move more quickly than usual to seal an accord. Johnson will use his control of parliament to outlaw any extension of the Brexit transition period beyond 2020. “Our manifesto made clear that we will not extend the implementation (transition) period and the new Withdrawal Agreement Bill will legally prohibit government agreeing to any extension,” Brexit minister, Michael Gove said.
