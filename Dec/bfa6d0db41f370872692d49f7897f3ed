Policemen in Ekpan Divisional Headquarters have arrested four Vehicle Inspection Officers, VIO, over the alleged death of a trailer driver. The incident occurred in Effurun, Uwie Local Government Area of Delta State, DAILY POST reports. The VIO Officers are currently cooling off their heels at the Police cell. It was learnt that one of the VIO Officers flagged down the trailer driver but he tried to escape, knowing that his particulars were not intact. When he (trailer driver) got to the Hausa Quarters along the NPA Expressway, he parked his vehicle in an attempt to escape. The VIO Officers gave him a hot chase and in the process, a hit-and-run petrol tanker crushed him to death. The incident caused serious tension in the area as sympathisers pounced on the VIO Officers. They were seriously beaten until the Police came to pick them up. The corpse, which was deposited at the morgue in the Hospital Management Board, Ekpan was later buried in line with Islamic religion. When contacted, the Delta State Commissioner of Police, CP Adeyinka Adeleke confirmed the report in a telephone chat with our Correspondent in Warri. CP Adeleke said,”It is not a case of murder. But it is a case of homicide.” According to CP Adeleke, “The intention of the VIO Officers was not to kill the trailer driver. They (VIO Officers) were not with weapons. They did not kill him. They were arrested. It actually happened.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
