Arsenal defender, David Luiz, has lavished praises on head coach, Mikel Arteta, backing him to become one of the best in the world. Arteta was appointed to replace Unai Emery earlier this month and took charge of a 1-1 draw at Bournemouth, before losing 2-1 to Chelsea on Sunday. Luiz has however been left impressed by his tactical nous, after spending time with him on the training pitch. “For me he will be one of the best coaches in the world. “I am lucky to have had many good coaches in my career, he is intelligent, he is clever and I think he will be one of the best “But it is part of our job to help him do that. People have doubts but I trust in his philosophy and the way he sees football. “He knows football. When you know football it is much easier to explain and understand the head of the players on the pitch,” he told BBC Sport. Luiz however admitted that some of his team-mates may not be able to deliver on Arteta’s vision. “It is not easy for him in the middle of the season, he didn’t choose the players, but he will do his best. This amazing club deserves better,” he added. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
