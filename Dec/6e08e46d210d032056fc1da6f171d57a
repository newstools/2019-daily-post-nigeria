The US Embassy has condemned the recent violent attacks on humanitarian aid workers in Nigeria. Four aid workers, working on a health project implemented by the INGO Action Against Hunger, were recently murdered by Boko Haram/ISWAP insurgents. They were amongst the six aid workers who were abducted on 26 July when their convoy came under attack near Damasak, in Mobbar local government area. One of the drivers was killed during the attack and another was earlier executed on 24 September 2019. In a statement on Wednesday by its Public Affairs Section, US also called for the protection of aid workers. “The United States Embassy honours the tireless efforts of humanitarian workers. “They risk their personal safety every day to provide critical assistance to those forcibly displaced and in need. “This has been starkly illustrated by the recent murder of the members of Action Against Hunger. “We condemn this senseless slaughter and extend to the grieving families our sincerest sympathy and condolences. “Humanitarian workers deserve the protection necessary to allow them to pursue their work. “We call on all parties to armed conflict to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law, including those relevant to the safety and security of humanitarian personnel,” the embassy stated.
