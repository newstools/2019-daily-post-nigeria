Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has claimed that Liverpool have already won the Premier League trophy, adding that this was something his former club never achieved at this stage of a season. The Reds are a long way clear at the top of the Premier League table after almost half of the season’s matches. Liverpool beat Leicester 4-0 at the King Power Stadium on Boxing Day to extend their lead at the top of the table to 13 points. Jurgen Klopp’s side are currently unbeaten 18 matches into the campaign, dropping just two points along the way. Scholes, who won the Premier League title eleven times with Man United, insisted that the title race is over this season and does not think there was any campaign previously where United won it at this stage. “I don’t think we’d ever won it by Christmas,” Scholes told Premier League Productions. “This team, look it’s game over, there’s nobody [who is going to catch them]. “I think the question now is how many points they are going to win it by, I think they’re so good. “[Manchester] City have a team if any team could get anywhere near them but I don’t expect that to happen. “I just think Liverpool are too good. I think the biggest fight we’ve got now this season is probably the relegation fight and third and fourth. “Leicester, on the evidence of tonight, they don’t look like a team who could finish in the top four with a performance like that.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
