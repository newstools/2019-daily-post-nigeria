Brig. Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim, Director-General, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), has warned corps members against unnecessary journeys, “especially at night”. Ibrahim gave the warning on Tuesday in Mangu, when he paid a familiarisation visit to the Plateau State NYSC Permanent Orientation Camp, NAN reports. “Investigation has revealed that most corps members, who had lost their lives in motor accidents, traveled at night. “I have held a meeting with the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), and the Nigerian Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), to form a synergy to ensure that no corps member is allowed to travel once it is 6 p.m. “We have resolved that NYSC staff would be stationed at various motor parks to ensure that the corps members comply,” he said. The NYSC boss further cautioned corps members against boarding vehicles on the road instead of the motor parks, saying that doing that was “very dangerous”. He also cautioned them against using the social media to spread hate speeches and religious bigotry, urging them to rather use it to promote peace and unity. Ibrahim said that the essence of the orientation exercise was to promote national unity and integration, and also remove stereotypes.
