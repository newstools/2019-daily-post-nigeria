Among the critics was former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Babachir Lawal who released a statement Sunday afternoon asserting that the election was a fraud and an insult to Adamawa people. The former SGF accused Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of failing to deliver on his promise to ensure free and fair elections. He said election did not take place in some LGAs, including Hong where he was during the election, and declared that the result of the election cannot be acceptable.
