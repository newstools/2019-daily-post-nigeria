Former Arsenal star, Charlie Nicholas has noted that Jose Mourinho has not changed anything at Tottenham Hotspur. This is following the recent 2-1 defeat to London rivals Chelsea. Mourinho has suffered three losses in his first eight matches at Tottenham. The defeats came at the hands of Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Chelsea.. The defeat to Chelsea has, however, raised plenty of questions about Tottenham’s ability to compete for a top-four finish. Nicholas believes not much has changed under the Portuguese coach even though Spurs are now seventh in the table. “I have been really impressed with Brighton, but they were poor against Sheffield United. At the same time, Tottenham were awful and well-beaten against Chelsea,” he told Sky Sports. “Heung-Min Son’s red card tells you all you need to know. Have things changed under Jose Mourinho? I don’t think they have,” he told Sky Sports. “Harry Kane looks off the pace and Jan Vertonghen is really struggling to deal with pace. If I were Brighton I would get Leandro Trossard on his side and really test him. “It’s essential that Spurs stay in the frame for the top four so for that reason alone I think they will get over the line.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
