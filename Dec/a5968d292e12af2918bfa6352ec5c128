The Speaker of Abia State House of Assembly, Rt Hon Chinedum Orji, has debunked rumors making the rounds that he is nursing governorship ambition in 2023, describing the report as fake news. The speaker attributed the rumour to the handiwork of his detractors who are deliberately spreading the falsehood just to distract him. Chinedum Orji is the son of a former Governor of Abia State and now, the current Senator representing Abia central district in the upper legislative chamber of the national Assembly, Chief Theodore Orji. However, in a statement released to newsmen on Sunday by his Chief Press Secretary, Jude Ndukwe, the Speaker posited, “My attitude towards politics is same as my decision in 2015 when I turned down the offer of being Speaker of the Abia State House of Assembly. “My detractors who are pushing these false narratives in a bid to be politically relevant, or seeking to be governor, should seek relevance through positive means and not by continually propagating falsehood against me in the name of a non-existent 2023 governorship ambition. I am not interested. “My pursuit of legislative excellence with my colleagues in the Assembly should not be mistaken for ambition but only a drive to repay the people who put their trust in me through the ballot. My detractors should stop being afraid. I am not contesting the governorship with them”.
