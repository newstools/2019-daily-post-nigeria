Women groups, who issued three days ultimatum to Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State to nominate more women in his cabinet or face occupation of Government House, have made real their threat. Hundreds of them stormed the government house premises on Monday, carrying banners calling on Abiodun to immediately act on the demand. DAILY POST reports that of the 18 nominees Abiodun sent to the legislature for approval, only two were women. The protesters in an open letter to the governor, which was also sent to the Speaker of Ogun State House of Assembly and Secretary to the State Government, insisted that more women in leadership are a prerequisite for sustainable democracy and development.  It read: “We are concerned about the absence of a sizeable number of women nominees for appointment as commissioners in the state. We believe that Your Excellency through these actions has failed to keep to your promise of ensuring gender equity through at least 35% inclusion of women in your government. We were surprised that out of 17 commissioners only two of the nominees are women. “We kindly want to remind the Governor about the promises that the cabinet will comprise 50% women which your excellency, made in different fora in the presence of the Nigerian media.  “May we also remind the Governor about our open letter on the above subject on the 27th of July 2019 and subsequent protest by women in the state to the Governor’s office, where they were received by the Deputy Governor, HE, Mrs Noimot Salako-Oyedele and the public assurances made to the mammoth crowd of women representatives. “We call on Your Excellency to emulate the Governor of Kwara State and other progressive Governors who had ensured, irrespective of all odds, to be inclusive in their nominations and appointments.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
