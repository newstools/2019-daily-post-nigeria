Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has admitted that his side’s major problem so far this season is not the defence but the team as a whole. Mourinho said this following Tottenham’s 2-1 win over Wolves in the Premier League on Sunday. Lucas Moura opened scoring for Mourinho’s men in the first half of the encounter before Wolves levelled in the 67 minutes through Adama Traore. However, Jan Vertonghen’s late goal gave Spurs all three points against the host. Speaking after the match, Mourinho, was quoted by Football London as saying: “The problem is not the defence. It is the whole team. When my three attacking players press high, as they did at the start of the game, well you know you’re not going to be able to do it all game. He added: “It’s one of these victories where quality is not enough. If you are not a team, a real team in the sense of what the word team means it’s impossible. Wolves are very, very good and very difficult to play against.” “This match is the perfect example of a match that only a team can win. You have to be a team.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
