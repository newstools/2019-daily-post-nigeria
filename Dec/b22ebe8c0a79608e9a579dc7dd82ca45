Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, Tuesday, bagged the Platinum Anniversary award of the Most Courageous Statesman and Defender of Humanity Award. Ortom was given the award by African Newspapers of Nigeria, ANN Plc, publishers of Nigerian Tribune. The governor was among fifteen other Nigerians who were presented with awards for their services to the country and humanity in general at Muson Centre, Onikan, Lagos State. Speaking, Ortom thanked the management and staff of African Newspapers of Nigeria, saying that the award would spur him to do more for the people of his state. Ortom also commended Nigerians for standing with Benue people at the time armed herdsmen invaded the state and were killing innocent people threatening to take over the land. The Governor reiterated his call on other Nigerians to reject impunity and uphold justice, stressing that the country belongs to all its people. Earlier, the Chairman of African Newspapers of Nigeria Plc, Dr Tokunbo Awolowo Dosumu said the organisation had chosen to recognize the Governor on its 70th Anniversary for exhibiting Uncommon Courage in Governance and Protection of Humanity.

The ANN Chairman said the governor had demonstrated unrivaled zeal and sense of responsibility in the protection of lives and property of Benue people irrespective of ethnic compositions at a time many leaders were playing politics with the carnage perpetrated in the state by marauding herdsmen.
