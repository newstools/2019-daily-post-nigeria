Eden Hazard has said he would return to Chelsea, when he is finished at Real Madrid. The Belgian left the Blues for Madrid this summer after seven years, for an initial £88.5m ($119m) fee. During his spell at Stamford Bridge, Hazard won six major trophies, including two Premier League titles and two Europa League crowns. The 28-year-old hasn’t quite managed to match those high standards during his first few months at Madrid, having dealt with a number of niggling fitness issues. Hazard took some time out from his rehabilitation programme this week, to speak to Chelsea fan Frank Khalid. “When I finish here I’ll come back. “When I can I watch. Not all the time. They are doing well, they’re young. Now they can pay for players, they can buy players now,” he said. When it was put to him that, with their transfer ban having been lifted, the Blues could look to sign Hazard, he responded: “I do my job here and then I come back.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
