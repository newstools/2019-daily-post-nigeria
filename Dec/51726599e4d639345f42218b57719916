The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the election of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State. The ruling was given in a unanimous judgment delivered by Justice Paul Galinje. Galinje held that the relief sought by the appellant did not fall within the ambit of the schedule of the electoral act and that prayers sort before the court in an election matter are jurisdictional and must fall within the reliefs allowed by the law in section 138 of the electoral act. Also, the court on Wednesday affirmed the election victory of Katsina State Governor, Aminu Masari. Recall that the Katsina State Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal had recently in Abuja validated the election of Masari of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Justice Dele Omotosho, in his judgment at the Zone ll Magistrate Court, Abuja, held that the petitioner failed to prove the allegation of substantial non-compliance to the electoral act in the conduct of the election, NAN reports. Omotosho, however, in his dissenting judgment, had allowed the petition and nullified the election of Governor Masari. He had also ruled that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) must conduct a fresh election in the state within 90 days. Omotosho held that Masari was qualified to have contested the election and that the petitioners were not able to prove the allegations which they hinged their petition. In the majority judgment, chairman of the panel, Justice Hadiza Alijos and Justice Ityonuyiman, held that petitioners failed to prove the allegations of non-compliance to the electoral act in the conduct of the election that produced Masari as winner.
