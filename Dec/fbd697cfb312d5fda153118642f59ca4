Former Chelsea striker, Chris Sutton has given his predictions for some of the UEFA Champions League round of 16 fixtures. Chelsea were drawn alongside Bayern Munich, when the draw for last 16 took place in Nyon, Switzerland on Monday. Champions League holders, Liverpool will battle La Liga giants, Atletico Madrid. Manchester City will face Real Madrid, while Tottenham Hotspur will tackle Red Bull Leipzig. Writing in his column for Daily Mail, Sutton said: “How will Jose Mourinho set up against the surprise German league leaders, Leipzig? This is a talented young side under [Julian] Nagelsmann. Sorry Jose, but I can see Leipzig nicking this. “Bayern are enduring a pitiful Bundesliga season but walked their group. “This will be quite the test for Frank Lampard’s Chelsea. “If Real play their A game that could spell trouble for City. But Guardiola could have Aymeric Laporte back by then, which would be huge. “Tough tie for Liverpool against Atletico Madrid but they are still the team to beat.” The round of sixteen games will be played on February 18, 19, 25 and 26. The second legs will be played on March 10, 11, 17 and 18 March. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
