Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola, has admitted that his side had no answer for the speed of three Manchester United’s attackers in their 2-1 home defeat to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men on Saturday. According to the Spaniard, Man City could not cope with the pace of Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Dan James. Rashford won and converted a penalty before Martial struck to give the visitors two goals lead in the first half. Nicolas Otamendi’s late goal gave City hope of a comeback, but Solskjaer’s United held on for a valuable win. With the defeat City fall 14 points behind leaders Liverpool, with their title defence in tatters. “I like how my team played,” he told post-match press conference. “We conceded a little bit more, not than usual, but than in the last years against United. “We knew with the pace they had [Dan] James, [Anthony] Martial and [Marcus] Rashford because sometimes it is not possible to control it. “In general, we did what we like. We arrived in the final third many, many, many, many times. Unfortunately, we couldn’t finish a little bit more but I like to watch my team. I know nobody agrees but I like it.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
