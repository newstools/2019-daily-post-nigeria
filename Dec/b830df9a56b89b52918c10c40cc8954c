Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has defended Antonio Rudiger following criticism from Jose Mourinho, for his role in Son Heung-Min’s red card during the Blues’ 2-0 win against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. Son was sent off after kicking out at Rudiger following a VAR check. After the match, Spurs boss Mourinho had suggested Rudiger should “stand up and play.” “With Toni, in this incident when he is having to post after the game about something we know is a huge deal [racism], I think to question his integrity in that time is disappointing for sure,” Lampard told a news conference on Tuesday, ahead of their Boxing Day clash with Southampton. “Pretty universally, certainly what I heard in the commentary and the post-match reflection was that the Son incident was a red card. “It wasn’t brutal but it was instinctive that warrants a red card in the modern day. It was pretty clear that was the case. I wouldn’t question Toni’s integrity on that. So I do defend Toni firmly on it.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
