Chairman of the commission, Dr Atiku Zawuyya stated this while parading the suspects at the commission’s headquarters on Monday. NAN quoted him as saying the police officer, who is serving with the Central Police Station, Gusau, and others committed acts contrary to Sharia law. Zawuyya said preliminary investigation conducted by the commission showed that one of the three girls was from Kaduna state while the two others were from the same family in Zamfara.
