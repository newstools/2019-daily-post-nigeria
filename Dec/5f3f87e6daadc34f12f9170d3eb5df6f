The Chairman of the Yoruba Council of Elders, YCE, Prof. Banji Akintoye, on Saturday, accused South West governors of being responsible for the high rate of poverty and insecurity in the region. Akintoye pointed out that South West governors were not doing enough to create jobs for youths, hence the high rate of poverty and insecurity in the region. Speaking during an Annual Distinguish Lecture organised by Ede Unique Club in Ede, Osun State, Akintoye said youths now resort to social vices as means of survival. He said: “There is no doubt that there is massive poverty in the South West and in the country at large. “And it is painful that our South West governors do not know how to handle poverty. “Rather than creating job opportunities, we are enrolling our children in schools with no job prospects. “Poverty is becoming unbearable in the region and as a result, many youths in the South West are engaging in drug abuse and other illegal activities. “The economy is declining, many are losing their jobs, there is a high level of corruption in the land and people are living in abject poverty. “There is no doubt that there is an urgent need for economic revival in the South West and in the country at large.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
