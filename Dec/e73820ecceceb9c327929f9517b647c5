The Ondo State Command of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, has arrested a notorious drug merchant in the state over his alleged link with the murder of four of its officials. According to the State Commander of the agency, Haruna Gagara who did not disclose the name of the drug kingpin, the drug merchant allegedly masterminded the killing of four of its men. He described the arrest as a big catch towards apprehending others connected with the incident. Gagara disclosed this on Tuesday at the end of the command’s one-week operation codenamed ‘Thunderstrike IV’ carried out towards ridding the state of illicit drugs. Recall that the command was thrown into mourning in February 2019 when four officials of the Agency attached to its Ifon Division were killed at a checkpoint within Ikaro/Sabo axis via the Benin/Owo highway in Ose Local Government Area of the state. The gunmen, who were three in number, carried out the operation on a motorcycle. They shot the four officers at close range, as well as burnt their operational vehicle. Meanwhile, Gagara disclosed that during the operation a total of 14.3 tons of Indian hemp farms were destroyed in six camps raided by his men. He also added that eight locally made guns and several rounds of cartridges were seized during the operations.
