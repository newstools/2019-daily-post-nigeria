The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) Comptroller General, Muhammad Babandede, has announced drug test for all officers. This was disclosed in a statement by the Service Public Relations Officer, NIS, Mr Sunday James, on Saturday in Abuja. Babandede said this as NIS graduated 509 officers of the 3rd Conversion and Upgrading Course at the Immigration Training School, Kano, Kano State. He reiterated the need for the officers to put what they learnt into action, noting that the service had invested so much into training and capacity development. He encouraged them to maximize the knowledge of ICT gained to uplift the standard of the service among other sister agencies by complementing each other wherever and whenever the need arises. Babandede warned officers and men to be cautious in the use of weapons in the course of duty. “We cannot afford to be careless with weapon; hence, all officers of the service will undergo drug test beginning with me. We shall not dismiss anyone at first discovery but we would try to rehabilitate. “However, if the fellow continued unrepentant, administrative procedures will be followed and appropriate sanctions applied,” he said.
