President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick, has said that head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, will only get a new deal if stringent clauses are included. Speaking with SportingLife, Pinnick explained that these clauses are to help the national team, ahead of the qualifying series for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Rohr’s current deal will expire in June 2020. “Sincerely, we want him to continue with his work and we have said that we are going to sit down with the coach in January with the possibility of offering him a new contract. “The truth is that we were carried with the euphoria of World Cup qualification and honestly, what he had can be regarded as a ‘raw’ contract. “But we are going to have some stringent measures for overall best interest of the Super Eagles and Nigerian football,” Pinnick. He added that some of the clauses would see Rohr take permanent residence either in Lagos or Abuja. The German will also be allowed to travel on vacation only three times in a year. It was also understood that the coach would henceforth work in conjunction with the NFF’s technical committee.
