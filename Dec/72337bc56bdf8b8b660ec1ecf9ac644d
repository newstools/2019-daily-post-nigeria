Senate on Wednesday urged the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu to arrest and prosecute the perpetrators behind the alleged killings and kidnapping in Boki local government area of Cross Rivers State. It also asked the IGP to establish a Mobile Police Barracks in the troubled area and condemned the destruction of property in its totality. This development followed an adopted motion sponsored by Senator Sandy Onor, titled, “Incessant cases of militancy, coordinated killings and kidnapping in Boki local government area of Cross Rivers State “. In his lead debate, the lawmaker recalled that last week, President Muhammadu Buhari had spoken about the worrisome crisis involving three communities: Ise-Obendege, Boje and Sadom in Boki Local Government of Cross River State. He added that Boki was a very critical and strategic local government in Cross River State and falls within his constituency. Onor, therefore, urged the upper chamber to lend its voice in finding ways and means of ending the ongoing crisis that has claimed many lives and property. In their alternate contributions, the red chamber in a majority vote okayed the motion. Senator Okorocha said, “Our traditional rulers should be given more responsibilities to handle issues of communal disputes because every one of us comes from a community. “We must return to basics and give traditional rulers responsibility”. Further, the Senate asked the Cross River State Government to take over the crisis-stricken areas and delineate the inter-community boundaries accordingly. Senate also directed the IGP to ensure better security of life and property in the affected areas of the local government.
