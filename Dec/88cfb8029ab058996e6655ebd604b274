Inter Milan striker, Romelu Lukaku, has admitted that Paul Pogba was the first person he confided in, when he decided to leave Manchester United. In an interview with New York Times, Lukaku opened up on his frustration at Old Trafford. The Belgian striker joined Inter last summer in a £73million move and has since scored 12 goals in 17 Serie A games, to help fire his new side to the top of the table. During his spell in Manchester, he netted 42 times in 96 matches, but feels the focus was always on the chances he missed. “I told him I was done. “I scored against Real Madrid in the European Super Cup but missed a chance. It was: ‘But he missed that one’. “I scored against West Ham in my first Premier League game: ‘Yes, but…’ From then on, I started to wonder how it was going to go,” Lukaku said.
