President Muhammadu Buhari, on Monday recalled events of his early age. He spoke in Katsina state, at the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Community Secondary School, Daura. Buhari said he became an orphan at a young age, but his nine years in boarding school and joining the army shaped his life. The President and five others founded the Community Secondary School as community service. “I spent nine years in the boarding school where the teachers showered us with love, care and total commitment. They treated you as their own children. “They commended you when you did well, and flogged you on bare buttocks if you misbehaved,” said the President. He praised the current management of the school, which is now renamed Pilot Secondary School, Daura, for maintaining high standards. Buhari added that Nigeria’s socio-economic and political salvation will come from education, urging citizens to embrace learning as a way of life while the government will do its best to provide access.
