Osita Okechukwu, the Director-General of Voice of Nigeria (VON), has appealed to the two dominant political parties, the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to adopt the model used in1999 when Chief Olusegun Obasanjo emerged president. He urged the two parties to nominate candidates from the South East. In 1999, Obasanjo and his rival, Chief Olu Falae of the then All Peoples Party (APP) both hailed from the South West. The VON DG, who spoke with newsmen in Enugu, yesterday, assured that if APC and PDP produce Igbo presidential candidates in 2023, it will remedy current prevalent gun-box democracy and return ballot box democracy in Nigeria. “In a multi-ethnic society like ours, where politics is a do-or-die affair, the only pragmatic answer to the palpable threat facing 2023 presidential election is the Falae/Obasanjo 1999 model. “Rotation of president is the ligament holding our fledgeling democracy. “The Falae/Obasanjo model was founded in 1999 on equity, natural justice and good conscience with the sole objective of a harmonious and peaceful country. “We may recall that in 1999 two Yoruba were fielded by national consensus under PDP and AD/APP alliance. “That was the genesis of rotation of president between north and south.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
