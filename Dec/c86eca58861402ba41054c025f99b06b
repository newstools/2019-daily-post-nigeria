Juventus manager, Maurizio Sarri, has said he hopes Cristiano Ronaldo wins his sixth Ballon d’Or on Monday. Ronaldo is up against fellow five-time winner Lionel Messi and Liverpool defender, Virgil Van Dijk, in the running for this year’s award. After watching Ronaldo overcoming a persistent knee injury to play a full 90 minutes in Juve’s 1-0 win over Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, Sarri said he was impressed with the 34-year-old’s recovery. “Cristiano did well in the last game, even with some resistance,” Sarri told reporters. “Now he just has to grow in terms of brilliance. “I hope that Cristiano wins the Ballon d’Or, de Ligt the Kopa Trophy and that Dybala will one day be a future Ballon d’Or contender.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
