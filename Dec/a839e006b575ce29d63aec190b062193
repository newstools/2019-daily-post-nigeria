The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has said its agitation for the Sovereign State of Biafra is for the betterment of all living Nigerians. In a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, IPOB wished its members and supporters the best of the festive season. According to a statement by the group, “IPOB agitation is not just for the liberation and well-being of Biafrans alone but for the betterment of every living soul unfortunate enough to be trapped in the cesspit of corruption, backwardness, hardship, and totalitarianism that Nigeria has become”. IPOB further cautioned politicians and those it accused of being involved in a conspiracy with Fulani cabals to bring RUGA and Fulani military into eastern Nigeria to stay away. The group explained that its members were highly upset and would not hesitate to vent their anger on any person or group found to be in collaboration with the alleged Fulani dictators. “It is in the interest of these traitors to stay away from Biafraland because they would bear the consequences of any move by the Fulani to force our land to become volatile to justify their murderous military occupation. IPOB also accused the Arewa north of employing the divide and rule strategy in an attempt to destabilise the east for their pesonal benefits. “We are well aware of the antics of core Arewa north and their current effort to intensify their divide and rule strategy in Biafraland by constantly seeking to pigeon-hole us into a meaningless South-South and Southeast when they have one monolithic political North dominated by the wandering Fulani tribe. ‘‘IPOB by successfully uniting all the people of the Eastern region and Midwest has brought this terrible era of Fulani divide and rule internal colonization in the Middle Belt and South to an end.’’ Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
