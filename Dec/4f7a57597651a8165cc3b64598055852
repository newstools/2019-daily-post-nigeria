The international NGO community also called INGO Forum on Saturday said, at least 20 aid workers have been killed in North-east Nigeria since the beginning of the large-scale humanitarian response in 2016. The Forum said they stand in solidarity with colleagues of Action Against Hunger (AAH-ACF) in this sad moment following the execution of four staff of the Action Against Hunger yesterday by the terrorist group ISWAP. The statement reads: “We are deeply saddened and condemn the recent killing of four humanitarian workers, previously abducted along the Maiduguri-Damasak road on 18 July 2019. “We are calling on all relevant stakeholders to ensure that Grace Taku, the last AAH-ACF staff remaining in captivity and all other humanitarians currently held, are immediately released. “Over ten years of conflict has deeply affected the population in North-east Nigeria. “Today more than seven million people are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance in Borno, Adamawa
and Yobe states. “Attacks against humanitarian aid workers cut off the population from much needed life-saving services. “All parties to the armed conflict must respect their safe and unhindered access to all the people in need of assistance. Aid workers are not a target. “Our thoughts and condolences are with their families, friends and colleagues.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
