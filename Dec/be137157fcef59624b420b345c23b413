Human rights lawyer, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, SAN, has condemned the rearrest of the convener of RevolutionNow protest, Omoyele Sowore by operatives of the Department of State Services on Friday. DAILY POST had reported that DSS operatives on Friday chased out lawyers from the courtroom and re-arrested Sowore. Following the invasion of the courtroom, the trial judge, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu adjourned the matter till February 11, 12 and 13 for definite hearing. They had earlier attempted to re-arrest Sowore but were prevented by those around. This is coming less than a day after Sowore was released by the DSS after an Abuja Federal High Court ordered for his release within 24 hours. Reacting, Adegboruwa sharing a video of the incident in court on his Facebook page described the situation as an act of lawlessness. He called on Nigerians to kick against the situation which he described as evil and a shame to the laws in Nigeria. He wrote, “This is lawlessness at its peak, for operatives of DSS to storm a courtroom where there is a presiding judge to arrest Omoyele Sowore, right inside the courtroom. “It was reported that the presiding judge was chased away with guns and the whole courtroom is in pandemonium right now. “I don’t feel proud to be a lawyer right now at all, let alone being a citizen of a country of lawless officers of the law who are shaming the law. We must rise up and kick against this evil.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
