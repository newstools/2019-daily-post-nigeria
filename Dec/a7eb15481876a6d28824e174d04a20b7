Enang said that the defendant made a false statement on oath at the Lagos High Court, and submitted it as a genuine document to the U.S. Consulate-General. “The defendant knew that his oath declaration was false and the traveller’s documents were fake; he still submitted them to the U.S. Consulate-General to be acted upon as genuine, ” Enang said. He said that the offences contravened Sections 114, 115, 363, 366 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
