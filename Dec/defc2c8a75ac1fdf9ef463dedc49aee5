The Benue State University Visitor, Governor Samuel Ortom has directed the institution to offer admission to Miss Goodness Thomas, an indegene of Niger State who emerged as best graduating student of St. Clement’s Secondary School, Gbaiko Minna for year 2019. Miss Thomas was allegedly denied admission by another Nigerian university. Governor Ortom’s directive follows reports that despite scoring 302 points in her Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), 278 points in post UTME test and six A1s in her Senior School Certificate Examination, Goodness was not given admission, thereby failing to realize her dream to study Medicine and Surgery. The Governor further gave the assurance that his foundation which runs charity programmes will place Miss Thomas on scholarship during her stay in the Benue State University. This was made known to DAILY POST by the Governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Terve Akase on Tuesday. Ortom reaffirmed the resolve of his administration to encourage young people who excel in their chosen careers to succeed, irrespective of religion, tribe and place of origin. He wished Miss Thomas a successful academic career. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
