Former Manchester United star, Gary Neville has slammed Arsenal defender, David Luiz for his rash tackle on Chelsea midfielder, N’Golo Kante during the Gunners’ Premier League 2-1 defeat against the Blues on Sunday. Two late goals from Jorginho and Tammy Abraham ensure Frank Lampard’s side defeated Mikel Arteta’s men at the Emirates Stadium as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s first-half goal was not enough to salvage a point for the host. Luiz contested a 50-50 ball with Kante at the closing stages of the first half during the encounter. The Brazilian followed through with a high boot which only narrowly missed Kante’s body as Referee Craig Pawson decided not to give Luiz a yellow card for risky play. “I have to say that’s unorthodox and stupid from David Luiz,” Neville said during his commentary for Sky Sports. “He just follows through ridiculously, I’m not sure he makes contact but what is he doing? ‘It’s a ridiculous thing to do, he’s played so well, the team has played so well, then you see that. “You think about what [Heung-min] Son got sent off for in the game against Chelsea last week then you see that. That’s just ridiculous, look at Kante, he looks towards the referee and says, ‘you gonna allow that?’.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
