Femi Fani-Kayode, a social commentator and chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has suggested that one of the secrets a retired Army General, Theophilus Danjuma may want to reveal to Nigerians is that the man in Aso Rock is not Muhammadu Buhari. Recall that Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, had last year claimed that that President Buhari was dead and cloned. He said the man in the Presidential Villa is Jubril al Sudani who, according to him, was impersonating alleged dead Buhari. DAILY POST reported that Danjuma, a former Defense Minister, said that Nigerians won’t sleep if he reveals what is happening in the country. He made the remark while lamenting that leaders from the South West were afraid of speaking out against the Federal Government. However, in a tweet on Saturday evening, Fani-Kayode wondered if Nnamdi Kanu has been proved right. He tweeted, “T.Y. Danjuma says if he were to reveal certain things to the public Nigerians would not be able to sleep. “Is it possible that one of those things is that Buhari is not Buhari but rather Jubril from Sudan? I’m just wondering. Has @MaziNnamdiKanu been proved right? TELL US!” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
