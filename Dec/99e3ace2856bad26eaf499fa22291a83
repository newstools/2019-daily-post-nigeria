Arsenal’s Head of Football, Raul Sanllehi, has given new manager, Mikel Arteta the immediate task of qualifying for the Champions League, according to the UK Mirror. Arteta watched on as the Gunners were held to a 0-0 draw by Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday. He will take charge of his first game against Bournemouth on Boxing Day. Arsenal are currently 11th on the table, six points off fourth place. “There are different degrees of success and we want the highest degree eventually. “To get to one point you need to go through phases. Of course, we want to be back fighting for all the titles that we can fight for in every season. “In the short-term, we want to turn this around and our ultimate objective for this season is to qualify for the Champions League because this is the place where we belong. “We’re a Champions League club. We need to be in the Champions League. And then win the league next season? Eventually. Let’s leave it that way,” Sanllehi said.
