Former Tottenham Hotspur manager, Harry Redknapp has predicted the winner between Manchester United and Everton when both sides clash in today’s Premier League fixture at Old Trafford. Man United head to the game following a 2-1 victory over Manchester City in their last Premier League encounter, while Everton defeated Chelsea 3-1. “Manchester United enjoyed their best win of the season against close rivals Manchester City in the champions’ own back yard and with eleven points obtained from their last five top-flight matches, the Red Devils have moved into fifth and within touching distance of a top-four place that looked to be well beyond them prior to their improved run of form,” Redknapp was quoted by Sport Review as saying. “Marcus Rashford has played a significant role during this wonderful spell and with ten PL goals is in the race for at least a place in the Golden Boot award. “Confidence is such a key element in sport and suddenly United are playing some eye-catching football and their fans now believe 2020 can be a successful one. A 4-0 romp in the Europa League against AZ Alkmaar on Thursday will see them in fine fettle for the weekend. “It will be interesting to see if caretaker gaffer Duncan Ferguson can inspire his troops after a fantastic debut 3-1 win over Chelsea. Having a man with so much passion for his club really worked wonders and the fans are fully behind their former star player. “It will be a big ask to back up last weekend’s effort and they visit Old Trafford at the wrong time with the hosts in such splendid form. “I expect a battling performance but the Reds to prove too strong at the conclusion.” The kick-off time for the match is 3pm.
