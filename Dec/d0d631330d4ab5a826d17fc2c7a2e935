The Ogun State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has eulogised the former Special Adviser on Women Affairs to ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo, Mrs Titilayo Ajanaku, describing her death as ‘painful exit’. DAILY POST reports that Ajanaku, who was the first female Chairman of Local Government in Nigeria, died on Wednesday after battling with an undisclosed terminal disease for years. According to a statement signed by the Publicity Secretary of APC Caretaker Committee in the state, Mr Tunde Oladunjoye, the copy of which was sent to DAILY POST on Thursday, the late politician was one of the foremost grassroots politicians and community leader the state ever produced. “Ajanaku, reputed as the first female local government council chairman, former Special Adviser on Women Affairs to former President Olusegun Obasanjo, and the Otun Iyalode of Egbaland, lived an eventful life with total dedication to the cause of humanity through her nursing profession. “She was a great mobiliser and very vocal on issues pertaining to women’s rights and gender balancing. Her political posturing and activism also brought her against the military junta, for which she bore the brunt, as she was among those politicians arrested, detained and charged in 1995 before the General Patrick Aziza-led military panel over phantom coup. “As one of the pillars of the People’s Democratic Movement (PDM), a political organisation founded and nurtured by late Alhaji Sheu Musa Yar’dua, Mama Titi Ajanaku served as a source of inspiration and beacon of hope to many people, especially women in politics. “With the passing away of Chief Titi Ajanaku, Ogun State has indeed lost a political Amazon, a benevolently community leader and a champion of women’s rights.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
