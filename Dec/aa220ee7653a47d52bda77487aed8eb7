Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) on Wednesday felicitated with Christians in Nigeria as they celebrate Christmas. A statement by its Director, Professor Ishaq Akintola, reminded Nigerians of the need for adherents of the Abrahamic faiths to forge a brotherhood of love, tolerance and forgiveness. “Christians, Muslims, African traditionalists, Hindus, Bhudists, Confucianists, Jainists, etc, are therefore under obligation to think humanity first”, it said. “We must halt all forms of segregation, stereotyping and discrimination on the basis of religion, race, colour or tribe. We must bring peace back to the world. “MURIC calls for a cessation of hostilities in all troubled parts of Nigeria and the rest of the world. We urge all homo sapiens compos mentis living in troubled areas to embrace dialogue as a means of returning normalcy to their regions. “In particular, we charge religious leaders in Nigeria to step up genuine interfaith relationship and adopt the philosophy of live and let live in order to put a halt to the constant heating of the polity. “We pray for the return of enduring peace and security in our dear country, Nigeria. We pray for the safe return of Leah Sharibu, the Chibok girls and all those in captivity in the country. “We pray for Divine protection and guidance for the leadership of the country at both federal and state levels. We also pray for political stability and economic buoyance for Nigeria.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
