Liverpool star, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has admitted that Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane find it difficult passing the ball to their teammates. The trio are likely to be named in Jurgen Klopp’s starting line up on Wednesday night as Liverpool face Everton. “Something that Sadio and Mo have in common is that they don’t pass us the ball much, that would be the main thing – they like shooting a lot,” the midfielder said at the launch of ‘Roar! for Diversity’, a new resource and competition for seven to 11-year-olds. Salah and Mane have been in superb form this season, scoring 14 Premier League goals between them to fire Klopp’s men eight points clear at the top of the table. The England international continued: “They’re both from Africa and they’re both Muslims. “They’re two players in our team that have different periods of the season when they have Ramadan which is a testing time for them because they don’t get to eat and drink at the same time as the rest of the team. “So we have to understand to try and help them and the coaching staff does that very well.” Chamberlain added, “The most successful teams bring together players with individual skills and qualities to be able to achieve success as a group. The Liverpool dressing room is home to players from more than 20 countries. Everyone brings something different to the atmosphere on and off the pitch! “The Premier League is for everyone. Using sport to inspire a generation of young fans to celebrate diversity is something I’m proud to be supporting.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
