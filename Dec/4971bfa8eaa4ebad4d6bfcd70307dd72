I am 100% Tottenham, 100% my club always, all my career. “No space at all for my previous clubs. I gave everything to all of them, my previously. Everything. I kept nothing from them. I gave everything but they are my previous clubs. I give everything to my club – my club is Tottenham. “For me, it’s so easy for me to play that game. Difficult because of Chelsea’s quality but not difficult from an emotional point of view. Not difficult at all. Easy.” The kick-off time for the match is 5:30pm.
