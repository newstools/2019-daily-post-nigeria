Arsenal head coach, Mikel Arteta, has told Nicolas Pepe to work harder, so he can feature more in his plans. Pepe came on for the last 10 minutes of the Gunners’ 1-1 draw at Bournemouth on Boxing Day. In Freddie Ljunberg’s final game as caretaker boss, the Ivorian winger was left on the bench for the entire 90 minutes. Arteta, speaking to the media ahead of Sunday’s clash with Chelsea, has asked Pepe to show more consistency. “If he is willing to learn, if he is willing to work hard, I assure he has potential to be top, absolutely top. “Against Bournemouth, he showed two or three actions already to show how good he can be. But he has to be consistent. “The problem is only confidence will only come when he plays. But he has to train well enough to convince the manager I am confident enough to play him,” Arteta said.
