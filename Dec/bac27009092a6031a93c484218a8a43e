Wednesday’s rescheduled El Clasico game between Barcelona and Real Madrid, ended in a goalless draw at the Nou Camp. Zinedine Zidane’s men had the chance to topple the champions with a win, but failed to make their dominance count. Raphael Varane saw his header cleared off the line in the first half, while Gareth Bale’s goal was ruled out for offside in the dying stages of the game. The result means Barca remain top with 36 points, the same as Real Madrid. However, the Catalans have a superior goals difference.
