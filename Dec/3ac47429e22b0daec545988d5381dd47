Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has blamed his side’s lack of qualify in the final third, for their 1-0 home defeat to West Ham. The Blues have largely impressed under Lampard this season, but lost to their London rivals at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Aaron Cresswell’s second-half strike proved to be the winner, as the Hammers eased the pressure on manager Manuel Pellegrini with their first win at Chelsea for 17 years. Reacting to the defeat, Lampard told Sky Sports: “We didn’t have enough quality in the final third. My gripe this season is that we are not converting enough chances. “Shocked isn’t the word. The Premier League is what it is. I’m disappointed more than shocked.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
