Victor Moses has ruled out the possibility of returning to Chelsea in the January transfer window. Moses moved to Fenerbahce on an 18-month loan deal, after falling out of favour under Maurizio Sarri. However, there have been speculations linking him with a return to Stamford Bridge, after Frank Lampard replaced Sarri. Despite playing for only four months for the Yellow Canaries, he ended the 2018/2019 season with four goals in 14 appearances in the Turkish Super Lig. Moses started this season in fine form, but has suffered a muscle injury, which has kept him out for two months. After returning to the pitch in October, he suffered a relapse and is out until next month. “Injuries affected me, but I will make a real contribution to the team in the league’s second half,” Moses said, according to quotes carried by Fotomac.
