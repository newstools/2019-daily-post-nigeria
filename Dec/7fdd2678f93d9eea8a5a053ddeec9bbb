Former Liverpool and Real Madrid striker, Michael Owen, has predicted that Jose Mourinho will leave Old Trafford with a point on Wednesday night, when he takes his Tottenham Hotspur side there for a Premier League fixture. Mourinho has won all three of his matches in charge of Spurs thus far, scoring at least three goals in every game. The Portuguese coach returns to United, almost one year after he was sacked and replaced by current boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Pressure is mounting on Solskjaer, with the Red Devils only picking up four wins from 14 league matches this season. “United shared four goals and the points with Villa on Sunday and it would not surprise me if we saw a similar result midweek when Jose Mourinho returns to Old Trafford for the first time since being sacked as United manager 12 months ago,” Owen told Bet Victor. “Both teams have scored and conceded in their last four games while Spurs have shipped two goals in all three fixtures since the Portuguese boss replaced Mauricio Pochettino in north London. “It promises to be a terrific occasion and one I see finishing with honours even.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
