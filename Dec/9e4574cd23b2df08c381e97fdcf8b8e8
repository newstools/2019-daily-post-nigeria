Former Arsenal midfielder, Samir Nasri has identified Manchester City’s Riyad Mahrez as a better player ahead of Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah. According to Nasri, he would rather work with Mahrez than play alongside Salah. He added that the Algerian international is more of a team player than the Egyptian star. “Between Mahrez and Salah, I would prefer to work alongside Mahrez,” Nasri, who currently plays for Anderlecht told Le Buteur. “Why? Because he is Algerian and I also like his style of play. “Mahrez is a collective player, while Salah is much more an individual player. He only aspires to score goals. I wouldn’t say Salah is selfish, but he runs behind goals and statistics. “Mahrez, meanwhile, you can play a one-two with him. He is a player with whom you can easily develop.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
