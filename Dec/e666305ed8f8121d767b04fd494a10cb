Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) says the closure of the country’s borders is in the interest of the citizenry. Joseph Attah, Deputy Comptroller and Public Relations Officer of the NCS, in a chat with the News Agency of Nigeria in Abuja on Friday, encouraged the public to be patient as it was for the greater good. He said: “Well you cannot get to a destination If you don’t want to endure the journey. Nigerians are desirous of an economically viable country, a secured nation. “Therefore certain actions have to be taken, partial border closure is part of it, because a secured border is a secured nation. “You cannot open your doors to all sorts of things that can compromise your economy and security. “Especially when you have neighbours who at will, want to engage in activities that will make effective policing of your border difficult. “So you take decisions that will call them to order and bring situation to perspective so that going forward we have a better border security and create enabling environment for local businesses to thrive.” Attah noted that most decisions taken by the service were based on the best interest of Nigerians and the overriding need to maximise revenue for economic development.
