Sacked Tottenham manager, Mauricio Pochettino, has turned down an offer to manage Everton following the sacking of Marco Silva. Pochettino declined the chance to become Everton’s next manager after they made an approach for him, according The Athletic. The Toffees sacked Silva yesterday with the side living dangerously in the relegation zone. Pochettino was sacked by Tottenham over two weeks ago and is now beginning his search for a new job. Yet he has decided against taking the vacancy at Goodison Park and will instead wait for other offers. “Everton Football Club can confirm that manager Marco Silva has left the Club,” a statement from Everton read. “Majority Shareholder Farhad Moshiri, Chairman Bill Kenwright and the Board of Directors would like to thank Marco for his service over the last 18 months and wish him well for the future. “Duncan Ferguson has taken temporary charge of the first team and will manage the side for the game against Chelsea on Saturday. “The Club aims to confirm a new permanent manager as swiftly as possible.” Everton are believed to be holding talks with Vitor Pereira about becoming their next boss.
