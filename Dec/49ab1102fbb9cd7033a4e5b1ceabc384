A former Governor of Imo State, Ikedi Ohakim, has issued a stern warning to Nigerian political leaders, telling them to avoid the mistake British made in Northern Ireland in handling the Biafran agitation and the Independent People’s of Biafra, IPOB. The former Governor stated this when he delivered a lecture titled “Nigeria: The Leadership Question,” at the 2019 Public Service Lecture and Award ceremony of the University of Ibadan Alumni Association, Imo State chapter on Saturday. He said the British made avoidable mistake in Northern Ireland, calling on political leaders to embrace peaceful negotiation to solve the problem of agitation. “They fell in the trap of believing that because they had power, weapons, soldiers, and experience that dwarfed those of the insurgents, it did not matter what the people thought of them. “History tells us that Britain couldn’t defeat the Northern Ireland insurgents for more than twenty years,” he said. Ohakim.noted that late President Musa Yar’ Adua heeded this advice and succeeded with the Niger Delta militants and amnesty programme. Quoting Attila the Hun, he said “it is never wise to gain by battle what may be gained through bloodless negotiations.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
