Former Chelsea player, Ashley Cole has advised the club manager, Frank Lampard to prioritise a move for a quality defender like Leicester City defender, Ben Chilwell in the January transfer window. Cole, who played alongside Lampard at Chelsea, believes Chilwell is good enough to play for the Blues, adding that the 22-year-old England star would be a superb signing for the West London club. “I’d love to see him [Ben Chilwell] here,” Cole told talkSPORT. I think he’s a quality player. “I’ve heard he’s a Chelsea fan so yes I’d like to see him here. It’s a big decision for the club but quality-wise for sure he is good enough. “But that depends on if he wants to leave or if Leicester will sell him – that’s something the clubs would need to talk about. “There’s always going to be a question mark going to a bigger club, but he’s doing really, really well in terms of how he is playing with Leicester. “He’s obviously enjoying the way Brendan plays, and the system, he’s got that licence to attack. “In terms of quality, for sure he has the quality to be here. It’s a big decision for the club but quality-wise for sure he is good enough. “I definitely think they need to add to the squad in terms of strength in depth really,” he added.
