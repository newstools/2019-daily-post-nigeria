The national chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Victor Oye, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government to factor the sufferings of the people into whatever programmes it plans to execute 2020. The APGA chairman opined that anything outside of this would increase the hardship and hunger in the country. Oye made his opinion known in a terse statement forwarded to newsmen on Sunday afternoon. The statement partly reads, “Despite the social, economic and political challenges facing our nation, we still have every reason to be grateful to God, at least, for keeping us alive and united to face these challenges. “The federal government owes the people of Nigeria adequate security; more amenities such as steady electricity, potable water, and medicare; more food; quality education; and general atmosphere of peace and tranquility. “We urge all Nigerians to remain steadfast in prayer and patriotic service to our nation, while hoping for the best in 2020. We single out the administration of Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State for special commendation for the able way it has piloted the affairs of the state, especially in the areas of security, road construction, food production, education, general infrastructure and regular payment of workers’ salaries and leave allowances, pensions and gratuities”.
