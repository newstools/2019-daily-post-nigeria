New Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has named his coaching team, with Freddie Ljungberg confirmed as one of his three assistants. Arteta left his role as assistant to Pep Guardiola at Manchester City last week, to replace Unai Emery at the Emirates. Ljungberg, who took interim charge of the team for six matches, remains as an assistant coach alongside Albert Stuivenberg and Steve Round. Stuivenberg is currently Ryan Giggs’ assistant manager with Wales and will combine duties with Arsenal until after Euro 2020. He previously worked with Louis van Gaal at Manchester United. Arteta has also brought in Round, who was part of David Moyes’ backroom staff at Everton and Manchester United. Inaki Cana Pavon comes in as goalkeeping coach from Brentford to work with Sal Bibbo. “I am delighted to have this talented group of coaches alongside me. They bring a great mix of experience and fresh thinking. “Along with the talented people we have in the club already they will be key people to get us back to winning ways,” Arteta told the club’s official website.
