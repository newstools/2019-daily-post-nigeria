Paul Ibe, the senior Spokesman for the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the last election, Atiku Abubakar, has shared some images on social media of a man changing his son’s name from Buhari to Suleiman. In the viral photos, the man from Dutsinma, in Katsina, Buhari’s home State, is angry over the performance of the current administration. Paul Ibe tweeted, “THIS IS WHAT TRUE CHANGE LOOKS LIKE IN PICTURES:
To underscore his dissapointment with Maj. Gen. @MBuhari’s performance in office, a man officially changed son’s name from Buhari to Suleiman in Dutsinma, Katsina.” The current economic hardship in the country has angered many Nigerians who now express their annoyance in different ways. President Muhammadu Buhari had defeated Atiku and the PDP during the presidential election and at the Supreme Court. The apex court dismissed the appeal of the PDP and Atiku against the APC and Buhari for lack of merit.
