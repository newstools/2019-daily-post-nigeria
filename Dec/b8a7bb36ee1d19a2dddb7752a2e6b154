In obedience to Justice Ollor’s ruling, the party had scheduled its activities to commence from Saturday Dec. 21 until this latest development. But loyalist to the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi and former member of the House of Representatives, Igo Aguma has stopped the planned Congress. Aguma, among other things want the National Working Committee of the APC to resolve the crisis in the party before conducting congresses. Obliging Aguma’s prayers, Justice Uchechi Kingsley-Chuku ordered, “the defendants in the matter to stop, refrain or desist from any action in furtherance of the subject matter (the Congresses)”. Defendants in the matter include Caretaker Chairman of the APC in Rivers State, Abbot Ogbogbula, APC and National Chairman of APC, Adams Oshiomhole. The matter was adjourned to January 27, 2020 for definite hearing.
