Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has hailed Red Bull Salzburg striker, Erling Haaland, as “a very big talent”. However, Klopp insists his team won’t be doing anything out of the ordinary to stop him, ahead of their Champions League clash. Haaland will lead Salzburg’s attack on Tuesday night, with the Austrian champions knowing a win will send them into the last 16 and dump the holders out of the competition. And when asked about the threat of the in-demand strike sensation, Klopp told reporters: “I had a time when I had Robert Lewandowski in my team. “All Polish reporters wanted to talk about him. I wish you could find something else you could talk about. “He [Haaland] is 19, exceptional. A big, big talent, a very bright future. “How do you defend a very good striker? Try and stop balls into Like the best strikers, you try to cut the ball from them.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
