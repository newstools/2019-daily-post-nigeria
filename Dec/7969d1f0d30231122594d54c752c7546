Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta has commented on midfielder, Mesut Ozil’s performance following his side’s 1-1 draw with Bournemouth in the Premier League on Thursday. Arteta said that Ozil played really well for the Gunners against the host, adding that the former Real Madrid star could have been the difference during the encounter. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang equalised in the second-half for Arsenal after Dan Gosling had opened scoring for Bournemouth. “I think he [Ozil] played really well,” Arteta told BBC Sport. “He worked and could have been the difference, we could have scored three or four goals from his balls through. “The final product wasn’t what we wanted. It was intense, I was so excited, I just wanted to pass that energy to the players and I really enjoyed it.” Arsenal will now face Chelsea this weekend in their next Premier League clash.
