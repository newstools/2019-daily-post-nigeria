The operatives of the Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit (Taskforce) has demolished over 2,500 illegal structures as it began the demolition of all illegal structures, shanties, kiosks and containarised shops at ‘Marwa Waterside’ area of Lekki, Lagos, over the weekend. Speaking on the demolition, the Chairman of the Agency, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi, disclosed that the exercise became imperative in preparation for the construction of a coastal road, which will serve as an alternative route for the Lekki-Epe Expressway and enhance free flow of traffic on that corridor. According to him, “Illegal business operators like iron benders, mechanics, food/fruits vendors and others were served a seven-day ‘Removal Notice’ by the government to remove their property and vacate the entire area and it expired on Thursday, 19th of December, 2019. “It was an eye-sore as these illegal artisans, food vendors and others littered the entire area with refuse and waste materials. “Investigation conducted revealed that none of these occupants and illegal business operators have any permit from the State Government as miscreants freely smoke and sell Indian hemp as well as engage in prostitution around residential premises.” The Taskforce confirmed that after the expiration of the removal order, the government still gave the illegal squatters additional eight days grace to vacate the entire area before embarking on the clean-up exercise as well as clampdown on all criminal elements disturbing law-abiding residents within Marwa waterside and the entire Lekki axis. He implored all illegal occupants on any of the government lands/property to immediately vacate same as it would not be business as usual across the state.
