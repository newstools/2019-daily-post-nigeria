The Senate has issued an ultimatum to the Department of State Services (DSS), the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, SAN and Femi Falana (SAN), counsel to Omoyele Sowore, to submit their testimonies. Others are the Executive Secretary of the National Human Rights Commission, Barrister Tony Ojukwu, Chief Judge of the Federal High Court and the presiding Judge at the time of the court invasion, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu.  Senator Michael Opeyemi Bamidele-led Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters said the memoranda are expected on Friday at the committee secretariat at the National Assembly. Speaking on Thursday in Abuja, Bamidele stated that the panel was unable to proceed with the scheduled investigative hearing after the Senate had suspended all activities in honour of Senator Benjamin Uwajumogu who slumped and died in Abuja on Wednesday. He said, “We are not able to proceed with the hearing because we lost one of our colleagues yesterday. He was on the floor of the Senate two days ago. We need to show concern for the departed soul. “Therefore avail us with memorandum within 24 hours. We have contacted the Office of the Chief of the High Court to give us perspective if what happened including the presiding judge”. “We’ll like to have the memoranda before the close of work on Friday”, the lawmaker added.
