Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has claimed that he was resting Kevin De Bruyne, when he took him off during their 3-2 defeat at Wolves on Friday. City blew a 2-0 lead, as Raheem Sterling’s double was cancelled out by strikes from Adama Traore, Raul Jimenez and Matt Doherty. The Blues played the game with 10 men, after goalkeeper Ederson was sent off in the 12th minute. With his side looking in control, Guardiola turned his attention to Sunday’s game with Sheffield United and replaced De Bruyne with Ilkay Gundogan. De Bruyne was visibly unhappy with the decision and the decision backfired as Wolves fought back to win. Asked why he took De Bruyne off, Guardiola said Amazon Prime: “We have less than 48 hours for our next game. “It is always what it is. We could not defend it at the end, they fought incredible, ran until the last minute. The goals could have been avoided.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
