According to Lala, Khafi told her that she followed Gedoni while on the show because she found something more in him. She wrote; “I remember my first conversation with Khafi when she came out of the Big Brother house…I celebrated everything she did in the house, but I was like ‘why did you follow a man that was a distraction.’ “She smiled and told me I was wrong, told me she felt she had found something that was beyond a reality show. She then said I should speak with him and assess him on my own. . “The first thing Gedoni told me was how much he loved Khafi and wanted to make her happy forever. Despite my many questions, he remained graceful. The rest they say is history! “I know you both genuinely love each other, so I pray that your love would keep growing stronger and stronger.
