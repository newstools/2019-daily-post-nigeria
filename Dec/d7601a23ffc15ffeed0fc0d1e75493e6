The Emir of Dass in Bauchi state, Alhaji Usman Bilyaminu Othman has described immorality among students especially in secondary schools as a source of worry and concern. Speaking during the 11th general meeting of the old boys association of Government Science Secondary School, Toro, Bauchi state over the weekend, the emir who was an ex student of the school asserted that students were more obedient to their teachers, seniors and disciplined during their school days.  He said the indulgence of young students in schools across the country into drug addiction is alarming. According to him, those who attended boarding schools in the past were very brilliant, disciplined, respectful and obedient to their teachers, seniors, parents and society in general. He therefore advocated the restoration of the virtues in boarding schools and tasked teachers to inculcate both knowledge and good values in their students so that they can be responsive and responsible citizens of the society.  Also speaking, the president of the association Malam Tanimu Umar explained that the purpose of the meeting is for the old boys to reunite, exchange pleasantries and discuss the problems bedeviling the school. He noted that the major problems they observed in the school are inadequate water, dilapidated staff quarters and non functional laboratory appealing to the state government to look into the matter.
