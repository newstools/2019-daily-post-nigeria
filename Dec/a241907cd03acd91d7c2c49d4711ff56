Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has said he “couldn’t care less” about the history of the Manchester derby. According to the Spaniard, it will have little bearing on the outcome, when City clash with United at the Etihad on Saturday. Guardiola was also reluctant to be drawn on the gap between the two clubs, with City already 11 points clear of their neighbours in the Premier League table. “It’s Man United, I respect what they’ve done for English football, European, and world football,’ said Guardiola. “It’s always United. It’s an important game, big rival, big history so of course it is (one of the biggest games of the season). “Normally here we speak about what happened in the past, the recent past, yesterday, the day before, everything has changed. I couldn’t care less and tomorrow is 5.30pm and the players decide who is going to win. “Of course United have a huge history and their quality is always there, but we must try to beat them. I speak to my players to see how to beat them,” Guardiola told a press conference. Earlier in the day, United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, aimed a dig at Manchester City ahead of Saturday’s derby, saying “at least we play every year now.” City’s relegation meant there was no Manchester derby between April 1996 and November 2000.
