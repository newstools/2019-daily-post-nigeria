Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has hailed Kevin De Bruyne as a “spectacular” player, following their 3-1 win over Leicester City on Saturday. De Bruyne put in an influential display, as the Premier League champions claimed an important victory at the Etihad. City fell behind to a Jamie Vardy goal, before Riyad Mahrez made it 1-1. Ilkay Gundogan converted from the penalty spot and De Bruyne’s powerful run set up Gabriel Jesus to make it 3-1. “I am delighted with the way we played. We created a lot and played really good,” Guardiola told Sky Sports. “We kept going forward and played balls so simply. We didn’t want to make every action incredible, playing simple is why the team played good. “I enjoyed it much more [than the Arsenal game]. Kevin De Bruyne was incredible tonight – he won the game for us. “He has always been incredible since we’ve been together. His commitment is incredible. He’s a spectacular player.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
