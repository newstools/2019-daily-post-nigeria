The planter of Christ Apostolic Church (CAC), Adamimogo Outreach, Prophet Sam Olu Alo, has said Nigerian youths are not prepared to take over the leadership of the country amidst prevailing unwholesome activities. Prophet Alo made this known in Ado Ekiti on Sunday during the commissioning of the state capital branch of the ministry. According to him, “Our youths must seek the face of God and have it in mind that they are the leaders of tomorrow. “But the evil deeds of today’s youths are more grievous than those we are are looking up to as leaders. There is need for them to get themselves prepared for the leadership task of leadership ahead.” On why there is no unity among African leaders, he said, ” Leaders are no longer putting God first. We never allow God to choose for us. “That is why election are being characterised by violence, with money, power and force as determining factors. It means the most powerful are getting more power.” Speaking at the event, CAC General Evangelist, Prophet Oladeji Hezekiah, said the prophesy he gave some 15 years ago had come to fruition. He, therefore, charged Nigerians to return to God for the country to regain her glory. Also present at the event were: Ewi of Ado, Oba Rufus Adejugbe; representative of Aare Afe Babalola, Pastor Modupe Babalola; Olojudo of Ido, Oba Ilori Faboro; The Atayero of Aramoko Ekiti, Omooba Segun Aderemi; Commissioner for Environment, Mr Gbenga Agbeyo; Pastor Olu Eyebiokin; Pastor Gideon Obiwale; Oba Moses Fabusuyi; among others.
