Mr. Nuru, who was represented at the ceremony by the Regional Head, South-West, Mr. Adelaja Adeleye, said, “with a robust product suite for businesses and individuals and our award-winning service culture, we intend to leverage these capabilities by investing extensively in some channels to reach more customers. Today, our customers are embracing these alternative channels such as mobile and internet banking, at an impressive rate, whilst others who prefer human interaction when banking still need the reassurance a physical branch offers. Our new Ondo town branch gives this reassurance as it is well-equipped to further enhance the experience of our customers’’.

It is non-pollutant and great for the environment’’. Mr. Idowu, added that, ‘’the Branch will also offer excellent services provided by our team of professionals. We are committed to scaling our operation, building the requisite capabilities, while deploying the best ways to simplify banking for customers who use our robust technology platform’’.
