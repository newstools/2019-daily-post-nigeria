Everton interim manager, Duncan Ferguson has named his backroom coaching staff after replacing Marcos Silva on Thursday ahead of his side’s English Premier League clash with Chelsea on Saturday afternoon. Everton made this known in a statement on their official website on Friday. The statement reads: “Everton caretaker manager Duncan Ferguson will be supported by a coaching team of John Ebbrell, Francis Jeffers and Alan Kelly for Saturday’s home match against Chelsea. “Ebbrell, Jeffers and goalkeeping coach Kelly will temporarily move from David Unsworth’s Everton Under-23s coaching staff to assist Ferguson. “The trio were part of the coaching team as Unsworth’s side won the Premier League 2 title for the second time in three years last season. The young Blues then added the Premier League Cup to complete an unprecedented double. “Ferguson, Ebbrell and Jeffers boast a combined total of 620 first-team appearances for Everton. “Kelly, meanwhile, made more than 450 club appearances and won 34 caps for the Republic of Ireland during a 16-year professional career.” DAILY POST had reported that Everton appointed Ferguson to temporarily take charge of the club as they begin their search for a manager after sacking Marco Silva. Silva, who had been under intense pressure, was sacked after losing against Leicester and a 5-2 hammering by Liverpool on Wednesday.
