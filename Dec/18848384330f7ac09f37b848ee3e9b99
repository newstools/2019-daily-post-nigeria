President Muhammadu Buhari has declared that he will not favour any politician to compromise the electoral process in 2023. The President, who turned 77 on Tuesday, vowed to give Nigerians a free, fair and credible election. Buhari stated this on Tuesday morning when Secretary to the Federal Government, Boss Mustapha, and some of his aides and assistants went to present a birthday card to him to mark his 77th birthday anniversary at the State House in Abuja. He said that politicians who intend to run in the next general elections should “start working hard to merit the trust of the people.” Buhari warned that he would not ” bend the rules for anyone against the will of Nigerians.” The President, however, told members of the All Progressives Congress, APC, his party, that whoever wants “to contest must work hard as he will not condone anyone using the name of his office to canvass for support.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
