Cameroonian legend, Samuel Eto’o has backed Ernesto Valverde‘s Barcelona to beat Real Madrid when both sides clash in the La Liga El Clásico fixture on Wednesday night at the Camp Nou Stadium. Eto’o, who has played for both Barcelona and Real Madrid, also hoped to see a great match between both teams. Barcelona head to the game following a 2-2 draw with Real Sociedad in the La Liga on Saturday, while Real Madrid played a 1-1 draw with Valencia on Sunday. When asked who will win between Barcelona and Real Madrid, Eto’o was quoted by Tribuna as saying: “Obviously I want Barca to win El Clasico and I think they will win. “But I also want to see a good game with respect for both sides. I hope it will be a great game, as it usually is. Eto’o added: “At Barca it was different, it was about Catalonia. Everybody used to talk about the game. I was always anxious just to be out there playing, but I’d be calm a week before the match.” The kick-off time for the match is 8pm.
