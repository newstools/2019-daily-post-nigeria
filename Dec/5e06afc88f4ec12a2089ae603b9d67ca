President of the Confederation of African Football (CAF), Ahmad Ahmad, has said the dates for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations could be reverted to the old calendar, because of unfavourable June and July climatic conditions in Cameroon. This year, Egypt hosted the AFCON in June and July, with the tournament moved from the traditional January and February period. With rains expected in the middle of the year in Cameroon, Ahmad feels it is not condusive to have the tournament then. “When we took the decision to move the Africa Cup of Nations to June, which we did for the last tournament in Egypt, we have always said that we need to have some flexibility over the dates,” Ahmad told Inside World Football. “This is because of the different climatic conditions in the continent. In my view, it is not possible, because of the climatic conditions in Cameroon, to stage the Africa Cup of Nations in June/July. This is clear, so we must take a decision on the date.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
