Former Nigeria captain, John Mikel Obi, has said Joe Aribo is not his natural replacement in the team. Mikel Obi retired from international week after the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations and his no. 10 shirt has been taken by Aribo. Aribo, who plays for Rangers in Scotland, netted on his debut for the Super Eagles in an international friendly against Ukraine.
