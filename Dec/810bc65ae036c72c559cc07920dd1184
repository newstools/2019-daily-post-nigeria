The National Youth Service Corps(NYSC) in Osun State has cautioned corps members posted to the state for mandatory 12-month scheme against unnecessary journey during the yuletide, to avert untoward circumstances. The corps emphasised the need for employers to seek permission from NYSC management before allowing corps members in their employment to travel. The Osun State Coordinator of the scheme in Osun, Mr Ayodele Adegoke made this known on Wednesday, during the closing ceremony of the 2019 Batch C, Stream II orientation course at the permanent orientation camp of the NYSC, located at Ede, Osun State. He added that the policy became necessary because of the peculiarities of road travelling as year runs to the end, adding that the scheme needs total cooperation from employers. Adegoke further disclosed that the total of 1200 corps members were posted to the state for the exercise. “It is pertinent to intimate various employers of our corps members of certain procedure for granting travelling permission to corps members. No employer of corps members should give travelling permission to corps members without approval of the NYSC.” The Secretary to the Governor of Osun State, Mr Wole Oyebamiji, who represented Governor Gboyega Oyetola at the event commended the management of NYSC for consistently propagating National ideals and values.
