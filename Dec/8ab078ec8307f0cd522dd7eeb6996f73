A Federal High Court, sitting in Abuja, Monday, declined to vary the bail conditions meant for compliance by a Briton, Richard James Nolan. It would be recalled that Nolan was accused of $9.6 billion fraud and money laundering obtained by the process and Industrial Development Company against Nigeria. While arguing the application, it was affirmed that Nolan had not provided enough evidence to prove that he was unable to get a Senator as Surety who would provide N500 million bond. Further, the prosecution counsel submitted that Nolan being a Briton with alleged fake Nigerian residence permit, may even jump bail. In his ruling, Presiding Justice Okon Abang said that the applicant had not even explored all avenues in meeting the bail conditions and dismissed the application. Abang also adjourned the case to December 10 for continuation of trial. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
