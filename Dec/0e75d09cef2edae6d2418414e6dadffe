Glasgow Rangers manager, Steven Gerrard, has named Barcelona striker, Luis Suarez, as the greatest player he ever played with. Gerrard played alongside Suarez during their time at Liverpool before the Uruguay international left Anfield for Barcelona in 2014. The ex-midfield maestro, who made 114 caps for England national team, also played alongside the likes of Wayne Rooney, Alan Shearer, Fernando Torres and Frank Lampard. “The arrival of Luis Suarez took us [Liverpool] to the next level,” Gerrard told BT Sports. “The best player pound-for-pound I’ve played with.” Suarez has scored 187 goals and provided 99 assists in 263 appearances for Barcelona since he joined the club from Liverpool. The striker has won lots of trophies with Barca, including the La Liga title, Copa del Rey and Champions League.
