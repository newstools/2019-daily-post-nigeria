Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has said Mikel Arteta must decide whether he believes he is ready to step into management. Arteta has been heavily linked with a move to Arsenal, following the sacking of Unai Emery in November. The Spaniard was a candidate to replace Arsene Wenger in 2018, but the Gunners settled for Emery. Guardiola appointed Arteta as his assistant in 2016 and the club allowed him to speak to Arsenal 18 months ago, while there was interest from Everton and Newcastle in the last year. “You can be a 45-year-old and believe you’re not ready [to become a manager] and 35 and believe you’re ready. Only he knows. “I’ve spoken about the situation a few weeks ago, there’s no more to add. I said two weeks ago, he’s got two weeks more experience, so he’s ready,” Guardiola told reporters on Friday.
