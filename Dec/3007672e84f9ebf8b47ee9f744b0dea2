All I’m saying is refraining from beating Bambam should be priority on your new year resolutions. “That one na bad thing? See your fans here, especially the women using abusive languages on me just to encourage a fellow woman to keep mute and continue forming in an abusive relationship. Something most of them will not condone. “Honey, tell them to stay off o. Because remember you beating Bambam is no lie. I am not saying she should leave you. All I am saying is please kindly stop beating her. “Merry Christmas my dear. Now tell your fans to keep their comments clean without insults. Not like I care but just because it’s Christmas. Thank you.” But, BamBam in a video on her Instagram page debunked the allegations, stressing that Teddy A has never beaten her since they have been together. She described the report as malicious and a way to taint the image of her husband and their names.
