Tottenham manager, Jose Mourinho, has claimed the club will never be the “kings of the market”. Spurs ended their transfer drought over the summer, by bringing in Tanguy Ndombele, Ryan Sessegnon, Giovani Lo Celso and Jack Clarke. But with Mourinho replacing Mauricio Pochettino and the club currently seventh in the Premier League, the possibility of more reinforcements has been floated. Mourinho has, however, said Tottenham’s transfer policy means a signing spree won’t happen. “I am at Tottenham Hotspur. I know the profile of club, I know the project, I know the vision, I know the objectives and I know that in our transfer market we are going just to react to things that can happen to us in the market. “If some player leaves we need to adapt to it. But we are never going to be the kings of the market, attacking important targets, fighting with clubs that are ready by their profile and philosophy to splash the cash and to go to the important targets. “We need to do our things in an intelligent way, a creative way, and I repeat I like the players that I have. The more I work with them, the more I know them, the more I realise their qualities and their problems. “I keep saying that I need time and this time is arriving. Not from yesterday until the 26th, or the 26th until the 28th. But in January, in February, we are going to have a little bit more time to try to improve it,” Mourinho said according to Goal.
