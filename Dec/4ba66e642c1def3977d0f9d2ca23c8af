Arsenal defender, Calum Chambers, has revealed what the club’s new manager, Mikel Arteta, told the team during their 0-0 draw with Everton in the Premier League on Saturday. Arsenal and Everton shared the point at Goodison Park as interim managers, Freddie Ljungberg and Ferguson took charge of their last matches. Asked about Arteta’s dressing room visit, and what he said to Arsenal players, Chambers told BT Sport: “He just wants us to be brave, take responsibility and work hard for each other. Those were the messages from him. “I feel we did that today and now there is more, there is a lot more, we can work on, his philosophy and the things he wants to bring to the team. I’m sure we’ll be working on that this week.” Arsenal will now take on Bournemouth in their next Premier League fixture on Boxing Day.
