Manchester City, Pep Guardiola, has once again lashed out over their fixture schedule, through the Christmas and New Year period. Following his side’s 3-1 victory against Leicester City on Saturday, Guardiola laid out in detail his team’s schedule for the next few days. “I wrote a letter to the Premier League to say thank you and we are going to the fridge after Wolves to get ready for Sheffield United,” Guardiola told the Telegraph. “[Sunday was] a day off, we are training [on December] 23 and 24. The night of the 24th is off. The morning of the 25th off. Then the 26th training and 27th [play] Nuno’s team.” The defending champions are currently 11 points off the top of the table. Guardiola’s men are third in the Premier League, still one point behind Leicester.
