Chelsea will be without right-back, Reece James, when they take on Arsenal in Sunday’s Premier League fixture at the Emirates Stadium due to an ankle injury. Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, confirmed this during his pre-match press conference on Saturday. Lampard’s men head to the game following a 2-0 defeat to Southampton in their last Premier League encounter. “Marcos Alonso got a small muscle injury,” Lampard said as quoted by Football London. “Hopefully he’ll be OK for Arsenal but Reece James probably won’t. He got an ankle injury and we need to look at it. It’s probably going to be a bit longer.” The kick-off time for the match is 3pm.
