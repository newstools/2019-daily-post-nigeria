The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), on Sunday, said that President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration is a government specialised in the spread of fake news. ASUU made this declaration via a statement made available to DAILY POST in Ibadan, the Oyo state capital by the ASUU Chairman, University of Ibadan chapter, Professor Deji Omole. DAILY POST gathered that the federal government had last week insisted that it has enrolled no fewer than thirty-nine (39,000) lecturers on the controversial Integrated Personnel Payroll and Information System (IPPIS), which the union has been resisting. But, Omole while reacting, maintained that the claim by the federal government is an indication that the government has specialised in the spread of fake news. He described the government as a greatest promoter of fake news over its claim that it has enrolled over 39,000 lecturers on the controversial Integrated Personnel Payroll and Information System (IPPIS). ASUU described the story as fraudulent and fictitious asking government to stop fooling itself. Omole while speaking further, stated that the union recorded over 90 percent compliance from her highly focussed, dedicated and loyal members. Omole who stated that it was also laughable that a government agency could go on air to say it discovered 100 fake professors in Nigerian Universities when it still needed verification of the names from University administrations. According to him, a government run on deceit and falsehood is an enemy of growth and development. He advised Federal Government to stop breaking the law in the name of fighting corruption and offer to help government in anti-corruption fight without breaking the law. He stated that University lecturers are different from University workers which the government claims it enrolled.
