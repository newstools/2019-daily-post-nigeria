Arsenal’s interim manager, Freddie Ljunberg, has lashed out at Mesut Ozil, over his behaviour during their 3-0 defeat to Manchester City last week. Ozil was left out of Saturday’s goalless draw at Everton and Ljunberg has said that the German was injured, but would not have even made the travelling squad. After getting subbed off in the second half against City, the 30-year-old threw his gloves on the floor and kicked at a bottle by the pitch. Speaking after the game at Goodison Park, Ljunberg told BT Sport: “He walked off, took his things and kicked them. I said at Arsenal, that’s not how we behave. “Mesut was injured but I would not have picked him for the squad, because I want to make a stance that that’s not what I accept from an Arsenal football player.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
