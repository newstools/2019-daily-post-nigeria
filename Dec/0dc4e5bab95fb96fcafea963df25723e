WBC champion Deontay Wilder has revealed he does not see a fight with Anthony Joshua for all the belts ever happening. Joshua reclaimed his WBA, IBF, WBO, and IBO belts from Andy Ruiz in Saudi Arabia on Saturday, almost six months after he lost it at Madison Square Garden. This has led to talk that Wilder and Joshua could face off in a unification bout. However, Wilder told The Athletic: “I don’t think we’ll ever see a unification bout. “We’ll never see it, and I don’t want people to get their hopes up on it because it’ll never happen. “They couldn’t say anything about fighting me. They couldn’t mention my name. They went around me “I’m too dangerous. You’ve seen what I do in the ring. I don’t play around. And they know if Ruiz can get Joshua out of there, imagine. That’s why they stayed away from me.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
