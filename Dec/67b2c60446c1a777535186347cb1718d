The Premier League will not change the way Video Assistant Referee (VAR) works for tight offside calls for the rest of this season, according to Daily Mail. VAR has proved controversial with fans during its first season in England, because of marginal offside decisions. There has been as much as five close ‘armpit’ calls during the most recent weekend of action. This week, the International Football Association Board (IFAB), which makes the game’s laws, stated that VAR should only overturn blatant errors. IFAB are set to issue guidance to leagues during their annual meeting in February. However, the Premier League have no plans to alter the way VAR makes offside decisions. The league feels changing the rules halfway through a season would “affect the integrity of the competition”.
