Plateau Governor, Simon Lalong, has assured that his administration was working with the federal government and security agencies to secure the release of Miss Jennifer Samuel. Lalong gave the assurance in a statement on Thursday signed by the Commissioner for Information and Communication, Dan Manjang. Jennifer, an aid worker, hailed from the Plateau State. The captive, who works with Alliance for International Medical Action, a humanitarian organisation in the North-East, and others were abducted in Borno by suspected Boko Haram insurgents. The governor stated that his government would not rest until Miss Jennifer Samuel and her colleagues were released. “The Rescue Administration is interested in the welfare of Plateau citizens anywhere in the world. “Channels of communication have been opened with relevant authorities to secure the release of not only Miss Jennifer Samuel but also other citizens in the captivity of the terrorists,” he said. Lalong encouraged the family of Jennifer to remain prayerful and hopeful as nothing was being left to chance to secure her freedom. In his reaction, UN Secretary-General António Guterres on Tuesday condemned the recent killings and abductions in the country and expressed solidarity with the Nigerian government and citizens.
