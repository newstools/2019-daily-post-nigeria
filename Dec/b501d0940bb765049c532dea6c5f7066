Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has insisted that he has no plans of bringing in a striker when the January transfer window opens. Zidane stated this while speaking to the media, after a 0-0 draw with Athletic Bilbao at the Bernabeu on Sunday. Madrid also failed to score against Barcelona in El Clasico at Camp Nou on Wednesday. It’s the first time since 2006 that the club have drawn two consecutive LaLiga games 0-0. “No. Absolutely not,” Zidane said in his post-match news conference when asked if his team needed attacking reinforcements. “It’s true that in football, you have to score. “We had three or four chances in the first half, where if you score, the game is different. That’s football, it’s two games without scoring, and we have to stay calm. “The important thing is to create chances. It will change in 2020.” Karim Benzema is their top scorer, with 12 league goals, while defender Sergio Ramos is next with three.
