Shandong Luneng midfielder, Marouane Fellaini, has ruled out a January move to Tottenham, amid rumours of a reunion with former boss Jose Mourinho. The Belgian currently plays for the Chinese Super League, whom he joined from Manchester United in February, two months after Mourinho was sacked at Old Trafford. The pair developed a close relationship during their time at Old Trafford, sparking rumours Mourinho would seek to bring him to North London. “Jose is special for me. “We text each other, we call each other from time to time. “He’s taken over at Spurs and he’s doing well. I wish him all the best, but I am good where I am now,” Fellaini told Eleven Sports. Fellaini scored seven goals in 22 appearances during his debut campaign in China as Shandong Luneng finished fifth in the table.
