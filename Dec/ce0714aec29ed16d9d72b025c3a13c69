The camp of former president, Goodluck Jonathan, has lambasted Bayelsa Governor, Henry Seriake Dickson, for “attacking” the former Nigerian leader. Reno Omokri, Jonathan’s former aide and one of the officials of the GEJ media house condemned Dickson in a statement Tuesday night. He suggested that pride caused the governor’s downfall at the November 16 governorship election. Omokri said: “You can keep sponsoring false stories against former President Jonathan, but that will not make your situation any better. Pride is your undoing. Learn humility so you can stop falling. “He, Jonathan is not joining and will never join the All Progressive Congress. Look at what hubris has done to you. When will you humble yourself so that God can raise you in His own time? “When will you stop biting the finger that fed you? Learn from HE Jonathan’s humility and save what is left of your political career. That is if anything salvageable is left.” Meanwhile, the All Progressives Congress (APC) has mocked Dickson for blaming everyone, including public institutions, but himself, for the loss of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the Bayelsa election Lanre Issa-Onilu, APC National Publicity Secretary, in a statement, said “if Dickson should stand before the mirror, he would see a clown, a prodigal son, and a failure, all rolled into one. We know he cannot do that. Shame would not allow him to carry out self-evaluation”. Dickson had insisted that there was no election in the state and alleged that what transpired was a well-organised conspiracy against that led to the massacre of innocent persons. But reacting, the APC spokesman said Lyon won because Dickson wasted the opportunity he had to become a hero in a state that badly needs one.
