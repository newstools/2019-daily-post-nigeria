The beef between popular Nigerian singers, Tiwa Savage and Yemi Alade seems to be over. Tiwa on Monday night invited Alade on stage to perform one of her songs. Both singers were seen dancing and singing on stage at Tiwa’s ‘Everything Savage’ concert. Speaking on stage, Tiwa said: “I’m about to bring out Yemi Alade. We do this for the culture.” In December 2018, the duo had engaged in a heated war of words on social media, after Alade claimed some female artistes enlarge their buttocks in photos to deceive fans. DAILY POST recalls that the Afropop singer, Yemi Alade also said that she might never do a music project with Tiwa Savage, because of the “troubles” from their fans. In an interview with Ndani TV, Alade said a collaboration might not attract positive reactions from the public.
