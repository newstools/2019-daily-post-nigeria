Juventus manager, Maurizio Sarri, has predicted that Manchester City are favourite to win this season’s UEFA Champions League trophy ahead of his team. The former Chelsea coach said this following his side’s Champions League 2-0 victory over Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday night. “I spontaneously think of Manchester City as my favourite [to win Champions League],” Sarri was quoted by Metro UK as saying. “The impression I have got of this team has convinced me and they will probably focus more on the Champions League than on the Premier League this season.” Manchester City have already qualified for the Champions League round of 16 stages. Pep Guardiola’s men defeated Dinamo Zagreb 4-1 on Wednesday night to book their place in the last sixteen.
