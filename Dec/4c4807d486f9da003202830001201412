Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has disclosed that he wished Everton interim coach, Duncan Ferguson ‘good luck’ following the Blues’ 3-1 defeat against the Toffees on Saturday at Goodison Park. Everton got off to a perfect start under Ferguson, after Richarlison headed in for 1-0 in the first half. Dominic Calvert-Lewin then netted brace either side of Mateo Kovacic’s fine finish to give the host all three points against Lampard’s men. Lampard shared a quick word with Ferguson on the touchline and congratulated the Scottish after the match. Asked what he said to Ferguson, Lampard was quoted by Metro UK as saying: “I just wished him all the best. “He’s obviously a man who felt the game passionately, you could see that and I understand that. “I just wished him all the best for the games they’ve got coming up.” Lampard added: “It was definitely a dangerous – extra dangerous – time to play against Everton, because they did have a bounce.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
