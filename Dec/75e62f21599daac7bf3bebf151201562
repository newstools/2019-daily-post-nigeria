Former Arsenal striker, Kevin Campbell has claimed that Manchester City’s assistant manager, Mikel Arteta is not the right man to take charge at the club. Arteta is expected to be announced as the Gunners’ permanent manager, following Unai Emery’s sack as manager. But Campbell thinks Arsenal’s hierarchy are desperate, adding that they should appoint an ”experienced and top manager” instead of the Spaniard. Speaking on the development, Campbell told Sky Sports, “I think Arsenal are desperate, I’ve got to be honest with you. “The way things never panned out with Unai Emery and the way the results are going, obviously against Manchester City the last game, it was a bit of a football schooling. “The hierarchy and the fan base, me as a fan as well, look at that and think ‘something’s got to change, something’s got to be done’. “It looks like the club are doing what they think is right, which is all they can do I suppose. “But it begs the question that it just creates more questions. “Why does a club like Arsenal not go for somebody who’s really experienced and a top, top manager? “Are they doing things on the cheap? Or are they trying to do a new vision?” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
