Former Liverpool and Chelsea manager, Rafa Benitez, has refused to rule out the possibility of becoming the coach of Premier League side, Everton. The 59-year-old Spaniard said he wants to return to England eventually with his family currently living at Merseyside. Everton are currently in search of a permanent manager after they sacked Marcos Silva and appointed Ferguson to temporarily take charge at Goodison Park earlier this month. When asked on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football whether he would be interested in coaching Everton, the former Newcastle United manager said: “Obviously I have connections to Liverpool but at the same time, we are involved in the city, we have a lot of friends in the city, so we don’t have problems with the fans or the city. “Obviously we are closer to Liverpool but I am a professional so in the future, you never know. I want to stay in England, I want to stay close to my family.” Benitez is currently working with Chinese Super League side, Dalian Yifang, but has been tipped to replace Unai Emery at Arsenal Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
