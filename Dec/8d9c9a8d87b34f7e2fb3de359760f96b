Manchester United striker, Marcus Rashford, has played down Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s comparison of him and Cristiano Ronaldo, insisting he still has a long way to go to match the Portugal superstar. Solskjaer said it was “easy” to compare Rashford and Ronaldo, after the England international scored his 13th goal in his last 14 games, in the 2-1 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium. Rashford has also reached 50 United goals in fewer games than Ronaldo. “As a forward player ever since I’ve come through, they always compare you with forwards that have been in the past and it’s something that you don’t really have much of an input on. “All you do is try to do your best on the pitch and then people outside do the talking about it. “It’s just a thing people like to do with forwards so it’s obviously nice, definitely a compliment. I understand how far I’ve got left to go to reach the heights they reached so I am very clear-minded and just focused on myself,” Rashford said according to ESPN.
