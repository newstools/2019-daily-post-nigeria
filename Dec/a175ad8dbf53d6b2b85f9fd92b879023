Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said Paul Pogba will not be available for Jose Mourinho’s Old Trafford return. Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Solskjaer also revealed that Scott McTominay and Nemanja Matic were “touch and go” for the game. Pogba has not featured since the match against Arsenal in September due to an ankle injury and returned to the north-west at the end of last week, after a spell of rehabilitation in Miami. “No. Paul’s not ready, no. “He’s still a bit away but he’s working hard so let’s see. He’s out on the grass, so let’s see how long it will take,” Solskjaer said. United go into the game in ninth place, two points behind Spurs.
