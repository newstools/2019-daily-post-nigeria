A Federal Capital Territory, High Court, FCT, sitting in Maitama, on Friday ordered the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, to detain Mohammed Adoke, former Attorney General of the Federation, AGF, and Minister of Justice for 14 days. Justice Othman Musa held that Adoke should be held in custody pending investigation. The judge gave the order while granting an ex-parte motion moved by EFCC’s lawyer, Fatima Mustapha to that effect. “Application to remand the suspect in EFCC custody for 14 days pending investigation is granted,” the judge said. DAILY POST had reported that operatives of the commission had picked up Adoke at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja upon his arrival from Dubai. The former AGF, who donned a white Kaftan with a white cap, arrived at the airport aboard Emirates flight, Boeing 777 -300ER, at 3.45pm. Upon his arrival, he was immediately picked up by EFCC operatives and transferred into a Toyota bus marked RBC 931 BV while reading a book he brought from Dubai. Confirming Adoke’s arrest, EFCC said the former minister arrived into the waiting arms of its operatives.
