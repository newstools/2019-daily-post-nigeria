Three times governorship candidate in Ogun State, Prince Gboyega Nasir Isiaka, has said he and his Believe Movement members did not form an alignment with Gov Dapo Abiodun of the state to get political positions. DAILY POST reported that Isiaka and his followers defected to the Dapo Abiodun faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) recently, then the Governor promising them an all-inclusive government. But, Isiaka, this morning, said they joined the incumbent governor so as to be able to contribute to the development of the state, having lost the March 9 governorship election in Ogun. Isiaka was reacting to insinuations that he and his followers were ‘deceived’ by Abiodun; as nobody from their camp made the recently released Commissioners list. Speaking through his Spokesperson, Bolaji Adeniji, on an Abeokuta radio station, Isiaka said he believed in Gov Abiodun’s vision for the state; saying that prompted their defection. Adeniji, however, said members of the Believe Movement could be appointed into Abiodun’s government as Special Advisers, Senior Special Assistants, Chairmen of boards and others; adding that this would accord them the opportunity to play vital roles in developing Ogun State. “We didn’t sign an MoU with Gov Abiodun. There was no negotiation. It’s just a mutual understanding based on alignment of values. We didn’t sit to share commissionership or political positions. We didn’t have any official agreement or MoU. What we had was mutual respect and opportunity for us to contribute to developmental conversation at the state level and at the local government level.” Asked, Adeniji, said GNI would not contest against Abiodun in 2023.
