It must prove to be a working adminstration. “This period is the best for President Muhammadu Buhari government to spread joy by ensuring that items Nigerians use on a daily basis are affordable “Over the years, prices of goods and other items usually move up during festive periods. For instance, products that sold for N10,000 is now N15,000. “The Federal government must try as much as possible to make sure that taxes on imported goods and products are reduced in order to boost the economy. “People should be able to afford things easily at low prices. Currently, the prices of bags of rice, hampers and other necessary products are outside the reach of ordinary Nigerians. We hope the situation improves”.
