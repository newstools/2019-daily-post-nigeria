Zlatan Ibrahimovic is set to rejoin AC Milan on a free transfer, Sky Sport Italia reports. It is believed the deal will be confirmed in the coming hours. Ibrahimovic spent two seasons with Milan from 2010 to 2012, winning a Serie A title.

Ibrahimovic earned $7.2million this past season with LA Galaxy, according to the MLS players salary database. Milan director, Zvonimir Boban, also cast doubt on the move due to concerns over the forward’s age.
