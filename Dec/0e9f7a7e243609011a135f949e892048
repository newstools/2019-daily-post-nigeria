Senior Pastor, Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ Gospel Church, Adewale Giwa says he is not sure whether or not there is a sitting president in Nigeria watching a “show of shame” displayed by the Department of the State Service, DSS on Friday. The cleric, who stated this on Sunday while addressing his church members in Akure on the need to continue praying for Nigeria, described the invasion of the Federal High Court in Abuja by the DSS as undemocratic. He said one could no longer differentiate between the Military and Civilian rule under the current administration. “Nigeria needs total deliverance from the hands of the few people who are hell-bent on destroying the country. Nigeria has now become a global laughing stock. Do we still have a sitting president in Nigeria? “Does he read Newspapers? Does he know what is happening in the country? If the head is sick, the whole body is sick also. Lies have an expiry date, but the truth will last longer. Without anyone stressing himself to explain to the world, we can identify the official of the DSS from a civilian. Why are these people turning black to white? How long would they continue to deceive us Oh Lord? “These lies will expire one day; Children of God, I must urge you to continue praying for Nigeria. These political leaders no longer know what they do. They don’t know how to govern people anymore. All they now rely upon is power they can use to mistreat the people. “We don’t know whether we are under the Military or Civilian rule anymore. They are scaring us, they don’t want us to talk again. Please, Oh God, manifest your power and destroy this Chushan-Rishathaim king in Nigeria,” said Giwa.
