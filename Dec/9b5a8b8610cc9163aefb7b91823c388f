The Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign States of Biafra (MASSOB) has declared that nothing can stop the struggle for the actualisation Biafra nation, not even Igbo presidency in 2023. Uche Madu, leader of the group was quoted by The Sun to have disclosed this in Owerri, the Imo State capital. According to him, the suffering, pains and torture of MASSOB members over the years cannot be healed by electing an Igbo President in Nigeria. “We are not agitating for Igbo president. Our 20 years of existence full of persecutions, arrests, tortures, mesmerization, killings, detentions, rejections are not for Igbo President. Though, MASSOB is not against the agitators of Igbo president but its manifestation will never stop Biafra actualization and restoration.” Madu reiterated that the struggle for Biafra could be actualised through non-violence because, according to him, “black Americans and India achieved their freedom through non violence. We shall remain consistent, unshaken and resolute in all our approaches towards our freedom from Nigeria. “The Biafra self-determination struggle has reached the point of no return. The consciousness and reality of Biafra has sunk very deep in the minds and thoughts of every Igbo person irrespective of his or her political, economical, social, religious and business affiliation or service with Nigeria.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
