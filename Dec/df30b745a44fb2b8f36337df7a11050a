Outgoing Governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, has insisted that there was no election in the state on November 16 because his people were insulted. Dickson alleged that what transpired on November 16 in the state was a well-organised conspiracy against the people which led to the massacre of innocent persons by agents of the state and thugs of the All Progressives Congress, APC. Addressing journalists in Abuja, yesterday, the governor claimed that the agents of APC and security agents wrote out results of the election which was announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC. He said: “The reality in Bayelsa is that there was no election. It is an insult to the integrity of institutions and our people to refer to what happened on November 16 as an election. “From hospital records, we can for now account for 93 people, who were injured during the attack on the PDP supporters in Nembe and are currently receiving treatment. “At least 12 people died from those attacks on PDP supporters. The story is the same in Southern Ijaw. Some SPOs have already approached us that they are ready to tell the story of how they were not allowed to do their jobs.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
