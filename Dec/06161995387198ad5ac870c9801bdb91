The outgoing Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, Mr. Musa Istifanus, has advised his successor, Mr. Tope Fashemi, to adhere to the rules and regulations in the civil service. He stated this during on Thursday at a send forth organized by the staff. Istifanus advised the new Permanent Secretary to be fair, balance and not succumb to any influence, adding that these values would keep him on top in service delivery to Nigerians. According to him, “it is better to be sacked and go home to relax than being invited by ICPC and EFCC for any wrong doing. Everybody would laugh and smile with you but what they have in their hearts is different from what their faces reflect”. “You do not have a friend or enemy in the service, what you have is equal human beings and once you treat everybody equally, you have already exonerated yourself not only in the eyes of human beings but also in the eyes of God”. In his remarks, Fashedemi thanked the Permanent Secretary and staff of the Ministry for their kind words and advice and promised to take on board their admonitions. Before his promotion, Fashedemi was the Director, e-government in the Ministry. He supervised the production of the Federal Government e-government Master Plan in collaboration with the stakeholders.
