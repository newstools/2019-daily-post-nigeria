Renowned English sports journalist, Piers Morgan, has reacted angrily after Arsenal drew 0-0 with Everton in their first game after appointing new manager, Mikel Arteta. Morgan took to his Twitter handle to admit that the goalless draw on Saturday lunchtime was one of the worst games he’s ever seen. Arsenal had the only two shots on target of the whole game. New Arsenal boss Arteta was in the stands at Goodison Park as Ljungberg oversaw his final game in interim charge of the Gunners. Morgan, a celebrity Arsenal fan, was clearly not very impressed by what he saw from the London side. Morgan said: “This is one of the worst games of football I’ve ever endured. #efcafc.” Earlier in the game, he tweeted, “This is such an insipid, uninspiring, boring Arsenal team. “Nothing to stir the soul. Devoid of passion. Frightened to take chances. Relentlessly mediocre. We can change the manager all we like – but we need better players.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
