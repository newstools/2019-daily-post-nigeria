Arsenal interim manager, Freddie Ljunberg, has told the board to make a decision on appointing a permanent man in charge of the team. Ljunberg has been in temporary charge of the Gunners, after Unai Emery was fired at the end of last month. Since then, he has only won once – a 3-1 victory at West Ham on Monday. Arsenal were undone by the three first half goals against the champions on Sunday, as they failed to capitalize on Chelsea and Manchester United dropping points this weekend. Speaking after the game, Ljunberg told Sky Sports: “I said to them (club board), they need to make a decision.” Names like Mikel Arteta, Max Allegri, Mauricio Pochettino, etc have been linked with the job.
