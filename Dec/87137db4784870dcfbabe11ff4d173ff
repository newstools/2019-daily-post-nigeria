Former Manchester City midfielder, Yaya Toure has warned former Arsenal star, Mikel Arteta that it is going to be difficult for him at Emirates when he finally becomes the Gunners’ new manager. DAILY POST had reported that Arsenal are expected to confirm Mikel Arteta as their new manager, before their trip to Everton in the Premier League on Saturday.  Arteta has agreed to a three-and-a-half year’s contract with the Gunners. The 37-year-old will earn £5million annually at the Emirates, the same wages Unai Emery was on. Reacting to the development, Toure believes Arteta can give Arsenal a new vision of football, adding that the Spaniard is the right candidate to take over at the North London club. “It’s going to be quite difficult. Why? Because Arsenal are struggling and I think if the directors of Arsenal listen to him [Arteta] and go in his way, maybe it’s going to work,” Toure told The Associated Press. “All the time when you come in a new club which is struggling, you need the backing of your board to listen to you and do what you want. “Obviously City have a lot more money [to spend] than Arsenal and I think it’s going to be quite complicated.” Toure added: “He’s very smart and he’s achieved a lot of experience in football games. “I think he’s going to be good, good, good for Arsenal because Arsenal need a manager with a new mind and a new setup. “We’ve been identifying Arsenal with Arsene Wenger because Arsene Wenger was top drawer for them. “I was so sad when I saw the fans arguing Arsene Wenger has to leave and… now what is happening? Arsenal need a new vision of football, and I think Arteta can do it.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
