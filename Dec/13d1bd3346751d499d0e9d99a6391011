The policeman who allegedly shot and killed a haulage driver in Ondo State is yet to be arrested. The Police Command in the state on Wednesday disclosed that the trigger happy policeman identified as Sergeant Idowu Omosuyi has been on the run since he committed the crime. However, the police stated that five of his colleagues who were at the scene of the incident had been arrested and are currently in custody. DAILY POST had reported how one Sergeant Omosuyi on Monday allegedly killed a truck driver, Ado Saleh, who was in transit through the state following an argument of N50 bribe, which the killer cop had demanded. The policeman, who was attached to the Federal Highway Patrol, committed the crime at a checkpoint on Akure-Owo Expressway, in Uso town, Owo Local Government Area of the State. Speaking on the development, the Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, in the state, Femi Joseph, said the men of the command were already on the trail of the fleeing suspect. “We are yet to arrest him (Omosuyi), but the other members of the team have been arrested and are currently in detention. “It was during our preliminary investigation that the members of the team told us that immediately after the incident, he (Omosuyi) dropped his gun and ran away. “But we are after him, he can not escape and we will soon declare him wanted if he doesn’t report himself to the command. The command has begun the trial of all members of the team and we are on the process of declaring him (Omosuyi) wanted if he fails to show up.” Since the incident happened, there had been condemnations from various quarters, particularly from the Nigerian Bar Association, who described the development as barbaric with a call to the police authority to endeavor to sanitize the force for the safety of the citizenry.
