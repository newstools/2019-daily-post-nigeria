United States President, Donald Trump has now been formally impeached by the House of Representatives, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The vote followed weeks of testimony, related to his dealings with Ukraine. 230 to 197 votes in the Democratic-majority House saw to the impeachment of the US president. Trump now becomes the third president in US history to be impeached. He will, however, remain in office until he is tried and convicted by the senate. It is an unlikely scenario because his Republican party has control of the upper chamber and are likely to acquit him. If he remains in office after the Senate trial, Trump will be joining a rare group of two other American presidents — Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton — who were impeached but saved by the Senate.
