The All Progressives Congress (APC) on Monday, described reports and a statement from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) alleging that N90 billion or N40 billion was released to the party by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) for election campaigns as hogwash.  The FIRS had denied report that it gave billions to Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, before the 2019 general election.  APC spokesman, Lanre Issa-Onilu, said the report was an unintelligent and crude attempt at a smear campaign. “Only the sponsors of the report believe their tales. We call on the sponsors of the baseless allegation to resolve their confusion”, he said. “Last time it was N90 billion, now it is N40billion. We also challenge them to provide evidence from not only FIRS but any other government agency where the APC took one kobo for campaign. “The matter of dipping hands into public coffers as a matter of official policy ended with PDP. We recall that leaders of the PDP had contemplated changing the name of their party at a time because they were ashamed of their own record of sleaze. “We, however, refer the PDP and co-peddlers of falsehood to the records of the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) in terms of Cost of Collection accruing to FIRS and indeed the FIRS statement on the subject matter.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
