The Ondo State Police Command has placed a ban on the use of fireworks during the yuletide across the state. With a stern warning issued over the use of fireworks, the police authority in the state admonished parents, as well as guardians to advise their wards against the use of fireworks, as it stressed criminals might use them to cause havoc under the pretence of celebrating. In a statement issued on Friday by the spokesperson of the command, Femi Joseph, police stated that anyone caught engaging in the use or sale of fireworks will be dealt with according to the law. “Parents and guardians are advised to warn their children and wards from using such fireworks under the guise of celebrating the Yuletide as criminals often use this opportunity to commit havoc. “Similarly, those who engage in the sales of these items are also warned to desist from such business as buyers, users and sellers are all culpable under the law.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
