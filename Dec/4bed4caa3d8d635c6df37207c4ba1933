Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has compared Liverpool winger, Mohamed Salah to Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi. Wenger admits that Salah’s progression has earned him the right to be compared to Messi. The Frenchman said the Egyptian has become the complete player just like Messi by adding assists to his game. “I like Salah, the way of his evolution,” Wenger told beIN SPORTS on Thursday in front of a smiling Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp ahead of the Red’s Club World Cup final clash with Flamengo. “Because he had touches last night [against Monterrey] of a playmaker. “He created chances around the box that are exceptional, there were things of Messi in him last night and I like that a guy who can score so many goals also becomes the guy who gives assists. “That is a complete player. That’s what we all admire and what we want from our players.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
