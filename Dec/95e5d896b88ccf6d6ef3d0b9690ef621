Mateo, the son of Barcelona superstar, Lionel Messi, was clearly thrilled as his dad won his sixth Ballon d’Or in Paris on Monday. Messi beat closest rival, Liverpool defender Virgil Van Dijk, by just seven votes to land his sixth world crown. The Argentine now leapfrogs Juventus’ Cristiano Ronaldo who has five awards. After Messi’s name was announced, his four-year-old son could not contain his excitement. The camera caught Mateo laughing hysterically when his dad went to collect the prize, turning to another boy believed to be Messi’s nephew, Augustin. The four-year-old continued to turn his head in excitement and bounce around in his chair. Mateo was at the ceremony with seven-year-old brother Thiago and mum Antonella Roccuzzo. Messi won the prestigious crown after 54 goals last season for club and country, as he won his 10th La Liga title with Barcelona.
