Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodgers, has signed a new contract with the club, ending speculations linking him with the Arsenal job. Rodgers had emerged as a contender to replace Unai Emery at the Emirates, but has now penned a deal until 2025, to stay at the King Power Stadium. His previous deal was to expire in 2022, but it emerged last week that he had a £14m exit clause, putting Arsenal on red alert. “When I made the decision to come to Leicester City, it was because I was excited about the direction the club was taking and how I could apply my experience to the journey. “I came here with a purpose to add something to that and to help the Club build for the future. “I have inherited an outstanding team of staff that are dedicated to progress and improvement and we have a group of players that are a joy to work with every day,” Rodgers told the club’s official website. Leicester City are currently second behind Liverpool in the Premier League. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
