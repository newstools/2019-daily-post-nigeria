Former President of the United States, Barack Obama, has listed songs by Burna Boy and Remy in his 2019 favorite music playlist. The former president listed Anybody by Burna Boy and Iron Man by Rema in his favorite music alongside 33 others. Obama shared the playlist on Twitter via his handle, @BarakObama. “From hip-hop to country to The Boss, here are my songs of the year. If you’re looking for something to keep you company on a long drive or help you turn up a workout, I hope there’s a track or two in here that does the trick.” He tweeted. This is the second time Obama will list Rema’s song in his playlist. In July, he listed Iron Man by Rema in his summer playlist. This is the first time Burna Boy who is a Grammy award nominee will feature in that playlist. Interesting, Angélique Kidjo who is competing for the same Grammy award as Burna Boy is also in the playlist.
