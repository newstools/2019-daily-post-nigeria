Following the verification of workers within the Local Government Service of Ondo State, 51 non-existing workers, otherwise known as ghost workers were uncovered. Disclosing this was the state’s Head of Service, Mr. Dare Aragbaye at the NUJ Press Centre, Alagbaka, Akure, the state capital while addressing newsmen on the 2019 Public Service Week celebration programme with the theme: “ICT and Innovative Governance: Panacea For Youth Unemployment and Migration.” While stressing that the move was made by the state government towards shedding off the overloaded wage bill of the state, Aragbaye maintained that the 51 workers refused to show up despite extending the screening exercise by about two weeks. The HoS, however, said that the state government has stopped salary payment of the discovered ghost workers due to their failure to appear for the verification exercise conducted for its workforce. Speaking on the new minimum wage for workers in the state, Aragbaye said that consultations were ongoing with labour leaders in the state to work out the modalities on the implementation of the new minimum wage. He revealed that Governor Akeredolu was eager to hear what the final outcome of the consultations in order for him to append his signature on the implementation of the new wage.
