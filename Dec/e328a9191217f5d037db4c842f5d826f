Manchester City playmaker, Kevin De Bruyne has blamed Arsenal’s attackers following the Gunners’ 3-0 defeat to Pep Guardiola’s side in the Premier League on Sunday at the Emirates Stadium. De Bruyne believes the likes of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Mesut Ozil and Nicolas Pepe failed to help out defensively when Freddie Ljungberg’s men did not have the ball. Two goals from Kevin De Bruyne and a strike from Raheem Sterling gave Man City all three points against Arsenal. Asked if he was surprised by Arsenal giving City’s attackers so much space, De Bruyne was quoted by Metro UK as saying: “We saw up front in the videos… the attackers they try to press up but when we pass their front four they really don’t help the Arsenal defence. “So they always stay with four players [Aubameyang, Ozil and Pepe] up front, except [Gabriel] Martinelli who comes [back] a little bit more. “So we always get spaces somewhere over the pitch. “I think it’s really difficult for the six defenders to control that because obviously you can come from everywhere on the pitch. “I think they left some open spaces and we exploited them really well. Obviously, when you’re 3-0 up it makes the game a little bit easier for us.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
