In line with the tradition of the National Assembly, the House of Representatives will adjourn sitting today due to the death of Ja’afaru Iliyasu from Niger State. Iliyasu passed away on Monday. Over the years, whenever a sitting member passes away, the House adjourns sitting to mourn the member. The Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila on Monday announced the postponement of the planned celebration of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), scheduled to hold on Tuesday. The Senate will also adjourn plenary. It’s, however, unknown the impact that this will have on the plan to pass the 2020 budget this week.
