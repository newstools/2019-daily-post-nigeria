Barely 24 hours after Nasir El-Rufai declared that kidnappers terrorising the state have been brought under control, a pregnant woman identified as Mrs. Okeke and two minors have been reportedly abducted by gunmen in Juji, Chikun Local Government Area of the state. Governor Nasir El-Rufai, had on Thursday, while being interviewed by newsmen in Kaduna at the federal and state administrators meeting, declared that kidnappers terrorising the state had been tamed. The gunmen, numbering about 20 were said to have arrived the community at about 1:00 am on Friday and started shooting sporadically in the air. A resident of the area, who sought for anonymity, said there was pandemonium as the residents ran for their dear lives. He explained that the gunmen headed for the resident of the pregnant woman who is a mother of three and whose husband was said to have travelled. A 12-year-old boy was also abducted with his mother who is recuperating from injuries she sustained from a motorcycle accident. She was, however, abandoned in the bush when she could not cope with the trekking following the injuries sustained from the accident. The woman was said to have returned home on Friday morning. A nine year-old-girl was also said to have been abducted by the bandits. According to the resident, “We heard shots around 1:00 am and all of us ran in different directions. “I ran to a nearby bush and hid until they left before I came out. It was this morning that we discovered that they left with the nine-year-old girl and the son of the woman who was abandoned but was able to find her way back to Juji this morning.” The police were said to have visited the area Friday morning. When contacted, the spokesman of the Kaduna State Police Command, Yakubu Sabo, said he learnt there was an incident in the area and promised to get the details of what happened.
