Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodgers, has admitted there is a clause in his contract, that could allow him to join Arsenal. Rodgers has been linked with the role at the Emirates, after Unai Emery was fired on Friday. The former Liverpool manager has transformed Leicester into title contenders this season and victory against Everton on Sunday, extended their winning run in the Premier League to six games. They are currently in second place behind Liverpool. It has been speculated that there’s a £14million exit clause in Rodgers’ contract, should any club want to poach the ex-Celtic boss. And Rodgers confirmed such a clause is in place. “There probably is in most manager’s contracts,” Rodgers told reporters at Goodison Park. “It’s all hypothetical, all these types of situations. “I think for me in this moment we’ve had a brilliant win today, we came back really, really well. My focus is very much with Leicester. “I made a change eight or nine months ago, I came into here and I’ve been so happy since I’ve come into here and I’ve been so happy to come into here to work with the players, we still have a lot of work to do. “So like I said, most manager’s contracts will have something in that but my only concentration is Leicester. “I’ve been very fortunate in my career to work with some brilliant clubs and some great institutions. This was an ambition to come to here and to help the club arrive in the top six. “For us, everything has been great since we worked together. We know there will be some bumps along the way. For me, my ambition at this very moment in time is to help this club. “I’m very happy in doing that, there’s great, great potential here at Leicester City in order to push on in the next few years.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
