Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has said that forward, Son Heung-min’s astonishing solo goal against Burnley in his side’s Premier League 5-0 win on Saturday, reminded him of a goal Brazil legend, Ronaldo scored for Barcelona during his time at the Camp Nou. Son picked up the ball on the edge of his own area and carried it the length of the pitch to score against Burnley as goals from Harry Kane (2), Lucas Moura (1) and Moussa Sissoko (1) gave Mourinho’s men all three points against the visitors. Speaking after the match, Mourinho told BBC Sport, “Son’s is a tremendous goal. “Harry’s two [goals from] outside the box and the pass for the Moussa goal. “A couple of better passes or choices and we could have had more. “I remember when I was at Barcelona with Mr [Bobby] Robson and Ronaldo Nazario scored a goal similar to Son’s. “And this was an amazing goal. I know that he is going to reach the face of the keeper and the control… he is unstoppable. The keeper is good, though, but he managed to put it in.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
