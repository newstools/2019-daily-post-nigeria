Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike has said no amount of media propaganda will earn any individual or ethnic group the governorship position in the state. Governor Wike called on all ethnic nationalities seeking for the governorship position to liaise with others, rather than take actions that will engender disunity in the state. The Governor said this when leaders and people of Kalabari Ethnic Nationality paid him a courtesy visit at the Government House, Port Harcourt. He urged the Kalabari Ethnic Nationality and their leaders to be strategic in their quest for Governorship. Governor Wike said that the Governorship Position in Rivers State was difficult to access because Abuja-based politicians and other key leaders were interested in planting people. According to Wike, “You must have a strategy to get the Governorship Position. Quietly sit down with other ethnic nationalities and work towards the seat. “The Governorship seat cannot be gotten through the radio. It cannot be gotten through falsehood. There must be a strategy in place. Nobody gives you the Governorship Seat as a gift. “If the Governorship seat is gotten as a gift, the people will not appreciate it. “Abuja is interested, other states are also interested in who becomes the Rivers State Governor. They want to plant a Governor of Rivers State. God will not allow it.” Governor Wike reiterated that no single ethnic nationality in Rivers State can make a Governor. Chairman of Greater Port Harcourt City Development Authority, Chief Ferdinand Alabraba who led the Kalabari delegation commended the Rivers State Governor for his commitment to state-wide development.
