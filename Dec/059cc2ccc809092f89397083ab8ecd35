The Minister of State for Power, Mr Godwin Jedy-Agba says the Federal government has started the process of returning industries back to Nigeria. The process of bringing those industries back, he said, was to make sure there was sustainable electricity in Nigeria. Speaking with journalists at a “Roundtable discussion on Power”, organized by the Senate Committee on Power in Abuja, the Minister insisted that power would be fixed to entice industries that have relocated back to the country. “The Federal Government has started the process of stable electricity. I might not tell you the details, but we have started. “The Roundtable discussion today is part of it and we shall all wait for the outcome which the executive arm of government would take it from there. “We are considering the off-grid mode of electricity as part of options to ensure sustainable energy in Nigeria. ” According to him, the government is ready to implement policies that would drive the energy sector sustainably, adding that challenges militating against steady power supply were being looked into.
