Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodgers has hailed Liverpool right back Trent Alexander-Arnold, describing the 21-year-old’s range of passing as “phenomenal.” He said that the England international’s attacking instincts were as good as that of a midfielder. Alexander-Arnold provided two assists for Roberto Firmino and scored late as Liverpool thrashed second-placed Leicester 4-0 on Thursday. Alexander-Arnold in central midfield and got his first taste of senior soccer under former Liverpool manager Rodgers in 2015, but has excelled in Juergen Klopp’s back line making eight league assists this season. “For me, he plays full back as a midfield player. His range of passing is phenomenal… he was a midfielder as a youngster,” Rodgers told a news conference. “His quality, the experiences he has gained, for Juergen he has been absolutely amazing. Trent is up there and is very much England’s number one (right back) and playing consistently at a high level.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
