Chelsea could be without their two key players, Fikayo Tomori and Olivier Giroud when they take on Lille in the UEFA Champions League fixture on Tuesday night due to lack of ‘match fitness’. Tomori and Giroud were not spotted with the rest of Chelsea squad at training on Monday, leaving their involvement against the French Ligue 1 club in doubt, according to Football London. The pair did not feature in Chelsea’s 3-1 defeat to Everton in the Premier League over the weekend. Chelsea had defeated Lille 2-1 when both sides met in November at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy Stadium, thanks to two goals from Tammy Abraham and Willian. The kick-off time for the match is 9 pm.
