Dr. Paul Enenche and his wife, Dr. Mrs. Becky Enenche, of the Dunamis International Gospel Centre, on Saturday, reached out to widows, orphans and less-privileged as part of activities to mark this year’s Christmas and New Year’s Celebrations. The outreach took place inside the Glory Dome at the Lord’s Garden, along Airport Road, Abuja. The ministration is done annually to reach out to people during the Christmas season. Speaking during the empowerment programme attended by several people from various denominations and across religious lines, Dr. Paul described the gesture as a way of reaching to people and as well reminds them about the love of Christ. He said the gesture was in line with biblical injunction, which says, “Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven.” (Matthew 5:16 KJV). Among items distributed during the ministration were: hundreds of bags of rice, tomatoes, bags of salt, Holy Bibles, noodles, tubers of yams, oil, toiletries, wrappers, and other items running into thousands of pieces each.
Earlier in October during her birthday celebration, Dr. Becky Enenche, singlehandedly sponsored an Empowerment of Outreach for women as well as the less-privileged where items such as sewing machines, grinding engines, deep freezers, bags of rice, industrial ovens and several other items worth millions of naira were distributed.
