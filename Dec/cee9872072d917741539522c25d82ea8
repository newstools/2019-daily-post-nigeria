A former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has has condemned the re-arrest of Omoyele Sowore, convener of RevolutionNow Movement. DAILY POST had reported that DSS operatives on Friday chased out lawyers from the courtroom and attacked journalists after which they re-arrested Sowore. Following the invasion of the courtroom, the trial judge, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu, adjourned the matter till February 11, 12 and 13, 2020, for definite hearing. They had earlier attempted to re-arrest Sowore but were prevented by those around. This is coming less than a day after Sowore was released by the DSS after an Abuja Federal High Court ordered for his release within 24 hours. Reacting to the development, Fani-Kayode wrote on bus Twitter handle, “What was done @YeleSowore is a disgrace and outrage! You fight and brutalize a man that has been granted bail by a court of law and you do it right there on the court that granted him bail . “You drag him all over the floor and you forcefully take him back into detention! Shame on you. “You have no respect for the constitution, No respect for the courts, no respect for judges, no respect for the rights of Nigerian citizen, no respect for decency, no respect for humanity and no respect for God. Buhari fear God and know that you will not be in power forever. “The worst aspect of all this is that they did it right in front of the television cameras. If they can do this to him in front of television cameras only God knows what they can do to him behind closed doors!” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
