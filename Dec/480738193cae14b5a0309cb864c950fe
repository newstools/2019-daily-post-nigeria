Former Newcastle United boss, Graeme Souness has advised both Manchester United and Manchester City to sign Leicester City defender star, Jonny Evans. Evans spent nine years and played close to 200 games for Manchester United at the early stage of his career. The Northern Ireland defender left Old Trafford for West Brom in 2015 and was signed by Leicester in 2018. He has since flourished, helping the Foxes climb to second in the Premier League. Souness believes that the defender has been a ‘revelation’ since arriving at King Power Stadium and would do well at both Manchester clubs. He told The Times that ‘”Tottenham v Chelsea is a significant match in what promises to be a fascinating race to finish in the top four. “We’re still in December and it’s too early to say who will join Liverpool and Manchester City in the Champions League places. “Leicester have come into the equation with Spurs, Manchester United and Chelsea. It’s those four for two places and a really hard shout at this stage. “United looked like they might have turned a corner with the wins over Spurs and Manchester City, then it was back to what we’ve seen for most of this season from them against Everton. “They are still hit and miss, so there’s a big question mark against them. “I saw Leicester win 4-1 at Aston Villa recently and they are a good team but maybe a bit light on cover for their main men. “Jonny Evans has been a revelation and both Manchester clubs would love him right now. If he and their other key players stay fit, Leicester will be there or thereabouts.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
