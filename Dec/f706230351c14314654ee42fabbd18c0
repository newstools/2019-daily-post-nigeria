The All Progressives Congress (APC) has congratulated Nigerian-born Anthony Joshua on becoming a two-time world heavyweight champion. Joshua beat Andy Ruiz Jr in a tense rematch in Saudi Arabia on Saturday. Lanre Issa-Onilu, APC spokesman, in a statement on Sunday said the ruling party was “proud to present Anthony Joshua as an emblem of a true Nigerian. We see in him, the embodiment of the national identity every true Nigerian is made of.” “With Anthony Joshua’s boxing career suffering a major setback following a shock defeat to Andy Ruiz six months ago, he approached the disappointment with positive spirit. “We are not surprised by Anthony Joshua’s deserved and stunning comeback victory which saw him retake the IBF, WBA, IBO and WBO titles. “Anthony Joshua now joins a small cluster of men including Muhammad Ali, Lennox Lewis, Evander Holyfield, Mike Tyson and Floyd Patterson to have reclaimed the world heavyweight title. “Anthony Joshua’s persistence and resilience represent the typical can-do spirit of Nigerians in the face of adversity. He is a man who is proud to be a Nigerian doing his best in his calling to uplift the name of his fatherland. “He rose to world best in boxing with determination, exhibiting the positive audacity for which Nigerians are known worldwide.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
