Anthony Joshua has told Deontay Wilder he is ready for a fight between the heavyweight division’s two major champions. Joshua regained the IBF, WBA and WBO titles from Andy Ruiz Jr on Saturday night, while Wilder will defend his WBC gold against Tyson Fury in February. Joshua told Sky Sports News about facing Wilder: “I’m ready. I’ve got my belts back and I’m ready to fight him. But I’m not looking too far into the future because it takes your eyes off what is front of you. “I take it step by step and, by the time I get to unification, I will be ready. “I’ll knock them down one by one and, when the big boys are ready, I’ll be ready to become the next undisputed champion of the world. “I really want to make that happen.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
