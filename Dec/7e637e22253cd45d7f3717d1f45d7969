Former Kaduna Central Senator, Shehu Sani, has reacted to the saga between Omoyele Sowore, convener of RevolutionNow Movement and operatives of the Department of State Services, DSS, at an Abuja Federal High Court on Friday. Sani lamented that nowhere is “sacred” with the desecration of a courtroom which he referred to as “temple of justice” by operatives of the DSS. In a post on his Facebook page, Sani wrote: “When the Temple of Justice is desecrated, there is nowhere else that is sacred.” DAILY POST had reported that DSS operatives on Friday had chased out lawyers from the courtroom and attacked journalists after which they re-arrested Sowore. Following the invasion of the courtroom, the trial judge, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu adjourned the matter till February 11, 12 and 13 for definite hearing. This happened less than a day after Sowore was released by the DSS after an Abuja Federal High Court ordered for his release within 24 hours.
