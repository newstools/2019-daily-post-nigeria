The Senior Pastor of Daystar Church, Pastor Sam Adeyemi has condemned the re-arrest of Omoyele Sowore, convener of RevolutionNow Movement. DAILY POST had reported that DSS operatives on Friday chased out lawyers from the courtroom and attacked journalists after which they re-arrested Sowore. Following the invasion of the courtroom, the trial judge, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu, adjourned the matter till February 11, 12 and 13, 2020, for definite hearing. They had earlier attempted to re-arrest Sowore but were prevented by those around. Reacting, the cleric on his official Twitter page, said the incident was ‘saddening.’ He, however, called on Nigerians to do better in order to build the country’s democracy. He wrote, “Watching the video of the re-arrest of Mr Sowore right inside a court of law is saddening. “People expect their leaders to model the right behaviour. When those that should enforce the law break it, it weakens everyone’s resolve. We must do better to build our democracy.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
