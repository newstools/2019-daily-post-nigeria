President Muhammadu Buhari has mourned with Christians over the death of renowned evangelist, Reinhard Bonnke. The German evangelist died in the early hours of Saturday while in the company of his family members. Bonnie’s family, via his official Facebook page wrote: “It is with sorrow that the Bonnke Family would like to announce the passing of our beloved husband, father, and grandfather, Evangelist Reinhard Bonnke. “He passed away peacefully, surrounded by his family, on December 7, 2019.” Buhari in a statement signed by Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, described Bonnke’s transition as a great loss to Nigeria, Africa and entire world. The statement read: “The President condoles with government and people of Germany, family and friends of the great preacher and teacher of the Bible, and all his co-labourers in the vineyard, praying that the good Lord will comfort all those that mourn him. “President Buhari affirms that Bonnke’s crusades in Nigeria, across Africa and the globe strongly accentuated the message of Jesus Christ, and his vision and zeal for the salvation of souls clearly helped the world in understanding the power of love and kindness as universal language. “The President prays that the Almighty God will accept the soul of the departed preacher, believing that his legendary contributions to the body of Christ in teaching and writing will always be remembered by posterity.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
