Arsenal playmaker, Mesut Ozil visited Unai Emery in his office at the club’s training ground immediately after finding out that the former Paris Saint-Germain coach had been sacked, according to The Athletic. The ex-Germany international put his differences with Emery and went along with the rest of the Gunners squad to his office at the club’s London Colney training complex to sympathize with the Spaniard. This is coming ahead of Arsenal’s Premier League clash against West Ham United on Monday night. Arsenal head to the game following a 2-1 defeat to Brighton in their last Premier League encounter. DAILY POST had reported that Emery was demised last month following Arsenal’s 2-1 defeat at home to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League. Ozil fell out of favour at Emirates under Emery, since he took over from Arsene Wenger. The 30-year-old was dropped on several occasions from Arsenal squad by Emery.
