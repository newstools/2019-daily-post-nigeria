Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has praised midfielder Tanguy Ndombele, for his performance against Norwich City in the Premier League. Ndombele impressed on his return to the squad as they drew 2-2 at Carrow Road on Saturday. The club’s record signing was left out of the squad for Spurs’ Boxing Day clash against Brighton. Ndombele however returned in the absence of suspended duo Harry Winks and Moussa Sissoko and his display pleased Mourinho. “He played very well. We played without a positional player, no Winks, no [Eric] Dier and [Christian] Eriksen and Ndombele played so, so well. “Totally in control, the football was so fluid, passing, movement, turning, never playing back passes, always getting the ball going forward and between the lines and looking for the wingers. Fantastic football,” Mourinho told reporters. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
