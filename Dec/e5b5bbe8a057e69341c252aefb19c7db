Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s brother, Willy Aubameyang has criticised Manchester City’s assistant coach, Mikel Arteta, as the Spaniard set to become Arsenal’s new manager. DAILY POST had reported that Arsenal are expected to confirm Mikel Arteta as their new manager, before their trip to Everton in the Premier League on Saturday. Arteta has agreed to a three-and-a-half year’s contract with the Gunners. The 37-year-old will earn £5million annually at the Emirates, the same wages Unai Emery was on. But reacting to the development, Aubameyang claimed that Arteta has “no experience,” adding that the ex-midfielder is just like Arsenal’s interim coach, Freddie Ljungberg. “Ljungberg, Arteta is the same, no experience,” Aubameyang was quoted by Metro UK as saying on Wednesday. Arsenal will take on Everton in their next Premier League clash on Saturday at Goodison Park. The Emirates club are currently in the tenth position on the Premier League table with 22 points from 17 matches.
