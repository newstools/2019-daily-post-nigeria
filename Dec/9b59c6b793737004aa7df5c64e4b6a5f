Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder, Jermaine Jenas has urged Chelsea board not to buy more players in the January transfer window despite their recent dip in form. Frank Lampard’s side were defeated for the third time in four Premier League outings on Saturday afternoon when they went down 1-0 to Bournemouth at Stamford Bridge. The Blues maintain their fourth place in the Premier League table but Sheffield United are now just four points behind them. Chelsea are bound to be linked with a host of players in the January transfer window after their FIFA ban was overturned last week. However, the former Newcastle United midfielder does not think the club should necessarily be looking to spend big next month. “Chelsea need to decide what they want to be now for the next few years,” Jenas told BT Sport after the defeat by Bournemouth on Saturday. “They’re a team that has won titles and always chased for titles but they’ve got a team full of very good young players who need a year or two to develop into a team that challenges again. “Do you throw all of that away and just buy stars? There’s no point. Stick with it. Don’t buy players, wait until the summer. “Frank needs to keep this core group of players and let them develop and then eventually they will challenge. There’s no point in panicking. It’s ridiculous.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
