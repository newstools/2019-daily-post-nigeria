Arsenal hero, Paul Merson, has criticised Mikel Arteta following his appointment as the Gunners’ new manager. DAILY POST had earlier reported that Arsenal on Friday confirmed Mikel Arteta as their new manager. Arteta signed a three-and-a-half-year contract, to replace Unai Emery. But, Merson doesn’t believe Arteta has enough experience to manage the North London club. According to him, Arsenal hierarchy would have considered appointing Sheffield United manager, Chris Wilder, who has shown more potential than the 37-year-old Spaniard. Writing in his column for Daily Star, Merson said: “Mikel Arteta taking on the Arsenal job is like Conor McGregor trying to fight Floyd Mayweather. “If the Arsenal board thinks they are suddenly going to start playing like Manchester City just because Arteta has worked with Pep Guardiola for a bit, they need to wake up and smell the coffee. “Arsenal don’t need a quick fix. They need a long-term plan. But you need that experience to start with. “Look at Chris Wilder and the job he’s done at Sheffield United. How has he not even been mentioned? “He’s done everything right, been through the leagues and been hugely successful. Worked his way up. “Coped in difficult situations. Gained years of experience. “Doesn’t even get a look-in. I’m not saying he should have got the job instead but to not even be considered? “I would love Arteta to be successful at Arsenal. I really would. And I’ll be the first to admit I was wrong if he is. “But it’s a big, big gamble for me. If he thinks he can turn it around, fair play to him. “But does he really think he is going to go in there and get them playing like City?” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
