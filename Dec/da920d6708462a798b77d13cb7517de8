Former Arsenal striker, Thierry Henry, has backed Liverpool to win this season’s Premier League title ahead of Manchester City after the Jurgen Klopp’s men thrashed Leicester City 4-0 on Thursday night at the King Power Stadium. Henry believes Liverpool are on a mission to win their first Premier League title in 30 years, adding that they are unstoppable this term. Asked whether the title race is now over, Henry told Amazon Prime: “For me, yes. ‘It was always going to be a matter of when, they are unstoppable. “What they are doing is frightening. Jurgen Klopp is never going to admit that but this team are on a mission. They’re not going to stop after tonight.” Henry added: “They will only party after the last game. It could have been 4-0 at half-time. He will say it’s not done and they need to keep on going but what they are doing is not normal. “I’m not a Liverpool fan but I like to see a team play like that. They create, they fight.” Liverpool are now 14 points ahead of third place Manchester City, who will tackle Wolves on Friday night.
