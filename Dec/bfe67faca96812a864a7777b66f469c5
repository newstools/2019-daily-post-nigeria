Former Arsenal midfielder, Ray Parlour, on Thursday urged the Gunners’ board to appoint former Napoli manager, Carlo Ancelotti as the club’s new permanent manager. DAILY POST had reported that Arsenal is currently searching for a permanent manager after the North London club sacked Unai Emery last month and appointed Freddie Ljungberg on a temporary basis. Ancelotti was sacked by Napoli after their 4-0 victory over Genk in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday. But Parlour now wants Arsenal to move quickly and bring Ancelotti to Emirates. “Yeah, I’d have him [Carlo Ancelotti],” Parlour told Alan Brazil’s Sports Breakfast Show on TalkSPORT. “You’ve got to move quickly. Look at Spurs, they had a plan. “Mourinho replaced Pochettino straight away. Ancelotti has got to ask the board if they’re going to back him, if they’re going to give him money to spend.” Ancelotti, a former Chelsea manager, has won League titles in England, France, Italy and Germany. The Italian has also coached Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Juventus, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain. — Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
