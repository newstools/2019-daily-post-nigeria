The national President of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Chris Isiguzo, has hailed the release of Mr. Omoyele Sowore and Col Sambo Dasuki, rtd., from the Department of State Services (DSS) custody. The NUJ boss applauded the government for doing the needful albeit belatedly, urging it to release other political detainees as well as journalists who have been clamped into detention based on trumped up charges especially by some state governments. DAILY POST reports that the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, ordered their release on Tuesday. Malami advised them to observe the terms of their bail and refrain from engaging in any act that is inimical to public peace and national security as well as their ongoing trial which will run its course in accordance with the laws of the land. But, reacting isiguzo in a statement on Wednesday stated that, “This is indeed a welcome development and a good Christmas Present for not just the duo but for democracy. Two key ingredients of democratic governance are Respect for Rule of Law and Free Speech (Press Freedom) and once they are not respected, democracy will certainly be under threat.” The Abia-born Journalist explained, “A case in point is the incarceration of Agba Jalingo, who is presently in detention on the orders of Cross River State Government. The Federal Government should quickly intervene by ordering his immediate release. “Democracy is about the people and any action that undermines people’s right to free expression remains unacceptable. Despite the challenges, Nigerians must continue to keep hope alive”. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
