Senator Dino Melaye has said that the newly elected senator representing Kogi West, Smart Adeyemi is still his ‘Political wife’. Melaye said this while lamenting the outcome of Saturday’s Rerun Senatorial election in Kogi State. Melaye vowed to reclaim his seat at the Senate, adding that he started politics before Adeyemi, hence he will still remain his political wife no matter what happened. Speaking on Channels Tv, he said: “There was no election, there was only an attempt to kill me. “I want to assure you that Smart Adeyemi would remain my political wife. I started politics before him. “I will reclaim my mandate because I was voted. I won the election, but through the instrumentality of violence and national conspiracy, these have been tampered with. I want to assure Nigerians that it is temporal.” DAILY POST reported that Adeyemi, APC candidate of the Kogi West Senatorial election got 88,373 votes to defeat Dino of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), his closest challenger, who polled 62,133 votes.
