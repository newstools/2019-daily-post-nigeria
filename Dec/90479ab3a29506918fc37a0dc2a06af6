Arsenal has confirmed Mikel Arteta as their new manager. Arteta previously played for the Gunners for five seasons from 2011 to 2016. The Spaniard has signed a three-and-a-half year contract, to replace Unai Emery. “This is a huge honour. Arsenal is one of the biggest clubs in the world. We need to be competing for the top trophies in the game and that’s been made very clear to me in my discussions with Stan and Josh Kroenke, and the senior people from the club. “We all know there is a lot of work to be done to achieve that but I am confident we’ll do it. “I’m realistic enough to know it won’t happen overnight but the current squad has plenty of talent and there is a great pipeline of young players coming through from the academy,” Arteta told the club’s official website.
