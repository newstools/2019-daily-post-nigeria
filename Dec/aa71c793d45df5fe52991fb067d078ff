Manchester United will now look to sign Dominic Calvert-Lewin from Everton, after missing out on top target Erling Haaland, the UK Sun reports. Haaland was heavily linked with United, but has now signed for Borussia Dortmund in a £18million move. Now, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has his eyes on Calvert-Lewin, who the Toffees value at £50million. However, Everton would be reluctant to let the 22-year-old go. Calvert-Lewin has scored 10 goals in 22 appearances in all competitions this season, including a match-winning double at Newcastle on Saturday. He also scored on Boxing Day against Burnley, in new manager Carlo Ancelotti’s first game in charge.
