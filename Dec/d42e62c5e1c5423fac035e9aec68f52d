Arsenal interim manager, Freddie Ljunberg, has praised Nicolas Pepe’s display, following a 3-1 win at West Ham on Monday night. Pepe scored his second Premier League goal to give the Gunners a 2-1 lead, after Gabriel Martinelli cancelled out Angelo Ogbonna’s opener. The Ivorian then set-up Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to score the third. Ljungberg, speaking to Sky Sports, insists he has no doubts over the forward’s quality but says he needs time to “adapt” to the Premier League. “People always ask me about Nico and I try to explain. He’s come from the French league into the Premier League, which is the best league in the world. “It’s a lot faster, a lot harder. He needs to adapt. People put pressure on him but it’s not easy. What he did today was work really hard offensively and defensively and showed his quality. “I’m so really pleased for him. He was a big buy for the club and pressure comes with that as well so I think he’ll fall asleep with a smile tonight,” he said.
