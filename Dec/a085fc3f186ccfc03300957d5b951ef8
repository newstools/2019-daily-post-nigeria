Tottenham manager, Jose Mourinho, has revealed record signing Tanguy Ndombele did not want to be selected for their Boxing Day victory over Brighton. The France midfielder, who has recovered from a recent groin injury, was a surprise omission as Spurs came from behind to win 2-1. There were whispers that Ndombele could be injured again, but Mourinho moved to clear up the speculation after the game. “I cannot say that he is injured because in five minutes we start a training session that you could watch from the stands and he will be training normally. “So I cannot say he is injured. I can say that yesterday he told me he was not feeling in condition to play the game, not based on injury but on fears of previous injuries that he has had since the start of the season, two, three or four muscular injuries and the feeling of not being ready to start the game. “But I cannot say that he is injured, I can only say he is not in condition which is a different thing,” Mourinho told reporters.
