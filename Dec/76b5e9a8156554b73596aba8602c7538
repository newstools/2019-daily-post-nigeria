Popular Nigerian Singer, Davido has reacted to the outcry from Nigerians over a viral video of him advertising an upcoming event in Commonwealth of Zion Assembly, COZA. Davido in the viral video posted by Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo on his official Instagram page was seen with a young girl advertising the program. However, Davido has come out denying knowledge of the video. According to him, he just made a video for a fan for personal use and had no idea it was going to be used for an advert. He threatened to take the case further if COZA and those involved do not take down the video, adding that he has nothing to do with the church. On his Twitter page, Davido wrote: “I’m writing to quickly disclaim viral videos going around of me advertising for COZA events. I have nothing or whatsoever to do with the church! “The fact I did a quick video for a kid introduced as a fan just for her personal use and it was chopped up and used for such an advert extremely disappoints me. “It is fraudulent and extremely disrespectful! I have never and definitely not associated with COZA church and have reached out to those responsible for this madness immediately! “I will most certainly be proceeding further if you do not retract that video. A word is enough!” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
