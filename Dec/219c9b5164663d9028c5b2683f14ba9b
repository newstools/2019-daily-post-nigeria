Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has predicted that the club’s interim manager, Freddie Ljungberg can produce “something special” at Emirates. The former Dortmund star believes that the Swede has Arsenal in his heart and knows how the Gunners players feel. Ljungberg took over from Unai Emery after the former Paris Saint-Germain coach was sacked by Arsenal last Friday. “He [Ljungberg] can give us something special,” the Gabonese striker was quoted by Metro UK as saying following Arsenal’s 2-2 draw with Norwich City on Sunday. “If I’m not wrong, he was part of the ­Invincibles. His career speaks for itself. We will try to follow him and give the best for him. “Everybody is respectful of Freddie. He played for Arsenal, he knows as a player how we feel. It’s interesting to have him. “We had only one [training] session with him, maybe two for those guys who didn’t play on Thursday. “We will see this week what is going to happen. I think it’s good for us. He played for Arsenal and he has this in his heart.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
