Arsenal hero, Paul Merson has blamed Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard following the Blues’ Premier League 1-0 defeat to Bournemouth at the Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Merson felt Lampard got his tactics wrong against Bournemouth, adding that the Chelsea manager would have ‘swallowed the pill and settle for a draw’ against the visitors. Bournemouth scored a VAR-awarded goal in the 84th minute through Dan Gosling and held on with relative comfort to end a run of five consecutive defeats. Chelsea have now lost four of their past five Premier League games. “With Frank, it’s not a good day at the office for him. It was 0-0 and sometimes you have to swallow the pill and settle for a draw,” Merson told Sky Sports. “He takes off Jorginho and brings on Hudson-Odoi and Batshuayi. Tammy Abraham was already on so he has all these forwards on, everyone is bumping into each other “I think Chelsea will need to go into the market next month. This is a crisis now. If other results go the wrong way for them, their lead [over the top-four] could be down to two points. “They’ve got Tottenham away next. It’s hard for them now. I think they have to go in the market. This squad, for me, doesn’t get into the top four.” He added: “Bournemouth definitely didn’t deserve to lose but they didn’t dominate Chelsea. “I watch Chelsea a lot and if you can get through the first 20 minutes against them, their confidence seems to go. “They’ve got a lot of young players and they are easy to play against sometimes. The pitch looks so small for the way they want to play, it just looks too easy to defend against.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
