An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court, on Thursday, sentenced two men: Biodun Ademoye, 18, and Abiodun Omotosho, 27, to two years’ imprisonment each for attacking a policeman with weapons. The magistrate, Mrs B.O. Osunsanmi, sentenced the duo after they pleaded guilty to a four-count charge of conspiracy, assault, extortion and a breach of the peace, NAN reports. Osunsanmi ruled that the convicts should serve out their jail terms without an option of fine. The magistrate delivering her judgment said, “You are hereby sentenced to two years’ imprisonment each without an option of fine. ”The sentence will serve as a deterrent to others who may want to engage in similar acts.” Earlier, the prosecutor, ASP Ezekiel Ayorinde, had told the court that the defendants committed the offences with some other persons still at large on Nov.14, at at Boladale Street in Oshodi, Lagos State. Ayorinde said that the defendants conducted themselves in a manner likely to breach the peace by extorting money, harassing passers-by and unlawfully assaulted Insp. Hosea Guruti. “The complainant had driven to the street where he parked his car to eat in a restaurant. “The defendants demanded that he should pay a fee for parking his car on their street. “The complainant insisted that he must finish his food before paying, but they pounced on him, beat him and broke his head with a weapon. “He was rescued by a police patrol team which was passing by,” he said. Ayorinde said that the defendants were arrested, while their accomplices escaped. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the affences violate Sections 168, 173, 174 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (revised).
