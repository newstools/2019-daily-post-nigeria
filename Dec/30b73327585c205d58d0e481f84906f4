Liverpool have completed the signing of midfielder, Takumi Minamino from Red Bull Salzburg. The UEFA Champions League holders made this known in a statement on their official website in the earlier hours Thursday morning. The statement read: “Liverpool Football Club can confirm an agreement has been reached with Red Bull Salzburg for the transfer of Takumi Minamino. “The Japan international forward will officially become a Reds player on January 1 after he finalised personal terms and passed a medical on Merseyside on Wednesday.” Speaking after signing for Liverpool, Minamino told the club’s official website: “It has been a dream, my dream to become a Liverpool player.
