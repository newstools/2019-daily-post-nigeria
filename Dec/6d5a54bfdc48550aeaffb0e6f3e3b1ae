Vieira’s former team-mate, Freddie Ljunberg, has been put in temporary charge of the Gunners, while the club continue to search for a permanent manager. Speculations claim Vieira, who is head coach of Nice, is one of the names on Arsenal’s shortlist, but the Frenchman has played down the rumours. “It’s a very difficult job and I realise that.
