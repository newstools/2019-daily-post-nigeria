Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has hailed President Muhammadu Buhari for ordering the release of Colonel Sambo Dasuki (rtd) and Omoyele Sowore. MURIC in a press statement on Thursday by its director, Professor Ishaq Akintola, however, demanded the release of the 54 soldiers serving jail term for asking for better weapons to fight Boko Haram. It said Nigerians became aware of the poor weaponry among federal troops fighting Boko Haram when the 54 soldiers demanded better arms. “They are therefore heroes, not villains and should not be languishing in jail. It was their protest which led to questions regarding the $2.1 million meant for the purchase of sophiscated weapons but which was diverted to fund political campaign”, the group noted. “President Buhari exhibited magnanimity by releasing Dasuki and Sowore. It is true that those two men have people, including the media, crying out day and night for their release unlike the 54 soldiers who have nobody to agitate for them. “We beg the president to show mercy to these young men. ‘The quality of mercy is not strained. It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath’. “We have borrowed the words used by William Shakespeare in the Merchant of Venice to appeal to Mr. President to use his prerogative of mercy in the case of the 54 soldiers. “We congratulate the families of the two men and all those who intervened in their cases. We appeal to the president to exercise his prerogative of mercy by setting the 54 soldiers free.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
