Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand has reacted after the Red Devils defeated Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham Hotspur in the English Premier League (EPL) on Wednesday night. Rashford netted twice, as Man United beat Spurs 2-1 at Old Trafford. Although Dele Alli made it 1-1 before the break, Tottenham were unable to contain Rashford, who netted the winner from the penalty spot. Reacting to the result, Ferdinand took to his official Twitter page to hail Man United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and his players for beating Mourinho’s men. He wrote: “Ole’s At The Wheel. Get in there… brilliant result! Well Done Lads. #MUNTOT.” The win over Tottenham means Man United are now in the sixth position on the EPL table with 21 points from 15 matches. United will now take on Manchester City in a Premier League derby fixture this weekend at the Etihad Stadium.
