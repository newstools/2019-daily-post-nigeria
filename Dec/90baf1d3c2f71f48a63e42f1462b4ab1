The Presidency on Monday insisted that operatives of the Department of State Services, DSS, did not desecrate the “temple of justice,” following claims of courtroom invasion. President Muhammadu Buhari’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina made the remark while faulting the comments of Sowore’s counsel, Femi Falana on what transpired at an Abuja Federal High Court last week. Recall that last Friday, DSS operatives reportedly chased out lawyers from the courtroom and attacked journalists and re-arrested Sowore. DSS, however, denied invading the courtroom before effecting Sowore’s re-arrest. The spokesperson of DSS, Peter Afunanya, had stated that the activist’s supporters were only acting an “orchestrated drama” inside the court.  Afunanya had claimed that none of its officers was involved in the incidents recorded in the courtroom. Reacting to the saga on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily, Adesina accused Falana of being biased. He said, “Falana is not a neutral party; we know the side he belongs to in this matter. His opinion will not count much. “We have had a concocted story, with concocted video or with incomplete video and then, the DSS has come out to give its own perspective and that then gives us a fairly balanced picture. “It still will decide on the predilection of people what to believe but if you are fair-minded, balanced, or neutral, I’m sure you’ll have a balanced perspective of what happened. “As far as I’m concerned, if you ask my opinion, I think what happened was not a desecration of the temple of justice as being portrayed because the DSS has explained how things played out.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
