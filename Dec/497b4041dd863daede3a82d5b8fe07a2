Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said his side will finish in the top four, if they can sort out their inconsistency. The Red Devils beat Newcastle 4-1 on Boxing Day, to move within four points of fourth-placed Chelsea. The win came days after they lost 2-0 to bottom-placed Watford. “If we get consistent, it’s not going to go down to the wire. “We should get into the top four without waiting for the last game against Leicester. But it might go down to that last game against them, who knows. “But for me, this team, I’ve said about next season we might be challengers for a lot more next year because we’re young, but I still expect a lot from this team this year. And I expect them to be ready for Burnley now, because that’s next,” Solskjaer told Amazon Prime.
