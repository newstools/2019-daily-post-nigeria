Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has revealed that Willian is in talks with the club over a new contract. Willian reinforced his position as a key member of the Blues’ squad, as he scored both goals in their 2-0 win at Tottenham last weekend. His current deal expires next summer and he is free to sign a pre-contract agreement with foreign clubs from January 1. Barcelona and Juventus are believed to be monitoring the 31-year-old’s situation. But Lampard is also a huge fan and says the club is trying to keep Willian. “He’s in talks with the club [about a contract], he speaks with the club on the money side of it. “[He’s been] Great for me, especially when he plays like he did the other day. It was an incredible performance. He has that talent. “I knew he had that talent before I got the job. I think I have said this before, but the last year or two I have looked at him from afar and wasn’t sure how much he was enjoying it, whether he felt happy in games. “A bit of body language, in and out sometimes. My feeling at the start of the season was to give him his head, tell him how much I feel about him and how I see him. “Get him fit, get him working off the ball because I know he can, and the rest in terms of what he does on the ball I can kind of let him do that because he has this incredibly ability to burst away from people,” Lampard told the media ahead of their Southampton game.
