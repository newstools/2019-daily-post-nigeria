The National Association of Nigerian Students, has exonerated the wife of Ekiti State Governor, Erelu Bisi Fayemi of complicity in the recent killings of two students of Federal University, Oye Ekiti . The students’ body also lifted the person non grata order placed on Governor Kayode Fayemi and his wife across all the tertiary institutions in the country, describing the role the duo played in ensuring proper burial for the departed students, as outstanding. Two FUOYE students, Joseph Okonofua and Kehinde Dada were shot dead on September 10, 2019 during a protest that coincided with the visit of Mrs Fayemi to Oye Ekiti, which led to confrontation between the first lady’s security details and students due to unruly and violent nature of the latter. The killings, had forced the NANS to make a public statement directing students to henceforth treat Fayemi and wife as persona non grata in all Nigerian tertiary institutions . In a communique by NANS’ Senate President, Gambo Abubakar Mohammed and Clerk, Kabiru Mohammed after its Senate meeting in Ado Ekiti on Monday, said neither the state governor nor the wife knew anything about the death of the students. The SUG President, Federal University, Lokoja , Kogi State moved a motion for the lifting of the order, seconded by SUG President of Niger State College of Education, Zakari Mohammed and was affimed by other Senators at the plenary. Exonerating Fayemi and wife further, NANS said: “Ekiti State government has taken the responsibility of paying for hospital bills of all injured students and for the burial arrangements of the deceased. “The government also visited the deceased’s’ families and compensated them while processing the employment opportunity for two members of the bereaved families.
