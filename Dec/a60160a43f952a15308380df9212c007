Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, has faulted the editorial by Punch Newspaper which changed Muhammadu Buhari’s title from President to Major General. Bello, who faulted the editorial, insisted that Buhari was the most democratic leader he had ever seen. He spoke while addressing State House Correspondents after meeting with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Thursday. According to Bello: “Mr. President is the most democratic President I have ever seen. “This is the first time we are seeing a former military head of state that is so democratic to the extent of allowing things happening in his home front to be democratized not to talk of things happening in the country. “Whoever is tagging him to be a dictator, I think that person wished to be a dictator himself, not Mr. President.” Punch had in an editorial titled “Buhari’s lawlessness: Our Stand” stated that it will “henceforth prefix Buhari’s name with his rank as a military dictator in the 80s ‘Major General’ and refer to his administration as a regime until they purge themselves of their insufferable contempt for the rule of law.” The newspaper had said its decision was in protest against autocracy and military-style repression under Buhari’s administration.
