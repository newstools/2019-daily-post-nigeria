Arsenal interim manager, Freddie Ljungberg, has insisted he is the man to stop the rot at the club, ahead of Monday’s London derby at West Ham, the UK Mirror reports. Ljunberg has taken one point from his first two games as caretaker boss, after replacing Unai Emery. Arenal are on the longest run without a win since 1977 and another defeat to the Hammers tonight, will increase the pressure to bring in a full-time coach. But when asked if he has got what it takes to turn around the campaign, Ljungberg said: “100% I think I can do that otherwise I wouldn’t be here but of course it is difficult. “When confidence is low, it is low. That is just how it is. But we are going to work on trying to get that back. We need to change this downward spiral. “I don’t think we should stop talking about the top four. But for us it is to concentrate on what we are doing here now and not look up, down, here, sideways. We just need to work on our own game and our own confidence.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
