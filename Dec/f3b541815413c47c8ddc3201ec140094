Ten persons have been arrested by men of the Ondo State Police Command for their alleged involvement in the razing of the church where Gold Kolawole, a one-year-old boy went missing. The Commissioner for Police, Undie Adie, confirmed the arrest of the suspects on Thursday as he stressed that effort is on towards nabbing others found culpable in the arson. Recall that on Wednesday, some youths had attacked Sotitobire Miracle Centre over the rumour that the corpse of the missing child was exhumed from the church’s altar following allegations that Gold had been used for rituals by Prophet Babatunde Alfa. According to the Commissioner, his men have swung into action towards avoiding breakdown of law and order within the vicinity. “Investigation is ongoing and I can assure you that any person linked with the incident won’t be spared. “Yesterday, we were able to arrest 10 persons and they are in our custody. “We also intercepted a vehicle carrying some of the properties looted from the pastor’s house. “The police were able to protect the pastor’s house from been set ablaze but some of his properties were looted and some of his cars were damaged but the cars have been moved to state CID.” Undie also confirmed the death of a Sergent Police Officer and two civilians noting that another Police was critically injured. The Commissioner appealed to residents of Akure to be law-abiding citizens and detach themselves from any unlawful act capable of putting them in trouble.
