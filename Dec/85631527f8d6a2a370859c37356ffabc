The Enugu State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has spoken on “plans” by former Senate President, Ken Nnamani to defect to the Peoples Democratic Party( PDP). APC state chairman, Ben Nwoye, in a statement on Monday, said Nnamani did not only work hard for the reelection of President Muhamadu Buhari, but had continued to contribute to the party’s growth. He recalled that Nnamani was in charge of APC campaign in the South East and won’t leave the platform he laboured for. “People should show some respect before they make a statement that tarnishes the image of our leaders”, Nwoye noted. “Politics is not driven by falsehood and character assassination. Nnamani has the capacity to communicate to the public about his political position. “He has remained an active and valuable member of the APC whose reasoned opinion is highly valuable to the APC both at the regional and National Level. “Those who have orchestrated this falsehood should look for positive means of channelling their energy. politics is not driven by falsehood and character assassination” he added.
