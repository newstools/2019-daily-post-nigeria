Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has reacted to his side 2-0 win over Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Sunday. The Englishman also said that he and the club will support defender Antonio Rudiger, who was allegedly racially abused by Tottenham fans. According to him “racism in football needs to be dealt with and punishments strong.” Addressing a post match press conference, Lampard said he disagrees with Mourinho’s analysis that Chelsea played in the familiar system they played in under former boss Antonio Conte, insisting he (Lampard) is not trying to clone anyone’s system. He explained that playing three centre-backs gave his side extra security today and allowed the likes of “Mason Mount and Willian to have more of the ball, especially on the counter-attack.” Lampard also insisted that Tottenham’s Heung-Min Son should have been sent off and does not accept Antonio Rudiger made more of the incident than he should have. He said that he and Jose Mourinho “are still friends after the game” and acknowledged the respect between them on the touchline throughout the match.
