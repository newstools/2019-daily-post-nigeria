Arsenal interim manager, Freddie Ljungberg, has said his players produced the right style of play, in their 2-2 draw with Norwich City on Sunday. Ljungberg took charge of the team, after Unai Emery was sacked on Friday. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted a brace as Arsenal twice fought back to earn a point, following goals from Teemu Pukki and Todd Cantwell. “We started the game really well, that’s how I want to play football,” Ljungberg told Sky Sports. “We dominated away from home at the start on the game. But we need to work on the transitions, we dominated and they break on us too easily. “In the beginning I saw a lot of things we worked on in training, but we need to score goals and take the lead. Twice they went behind and showed a great mentality to come back. “I want this club to do well, it is only winning that counts. I wanted to win the game so I am disappointed but I have also seen some positive things.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
