Arsenal hero, Paul Merson has provided a very interesting point for the debate on who is a better manager between Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola and Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp. The former Premier League star believes that Klopp could manage and build any team out of nothing, whereas Guardiola needs millions to spend wherever he goes. Merson told Daily Star that,
“Jurgen Klopp is proving to Pep Guardiola this season that he is the best manager in the world. “Liverpool made Leicester look run of the mill. And it’s all down to Klopp. He’s built that team. And he’s beating Guardiola even though he hasn’t spent anywhere near as much money. “That’s what makes him the best. Klopp could take Rotherham through the divisions and make them a Premier League club, given time. “Guardiola can’t do that. He needs £80m or £90m players to make his system work. Klopp doesn’t. It’s a massive achievement, what he’s built.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
