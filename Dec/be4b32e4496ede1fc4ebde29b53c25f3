Juventus manager, Maurizio Sarri has reacted to forward, Cristiano Ronaldo’s header goal against Sampdoria in his side’s Serie A 2-1 victory on Wednesday night. DAILY POST had reported that Ronaldo won the game for Maurizio Sarri’s men with a lovely header at the back post after Paulo Dybala had scored the first goal for Juve. Sarri, who was stunned by Ronaldo and Dybala’s goals against the host, said ‘wow’ does not describe either strike, adding that the two goals were ‘outstanding’. “When Ronaldo scored I thought the same as the Dybala one – ‘f***, wow,” Sarri was quoted by Goal as saying at his post-match press conference. “But wow does not describe it all. They both scored two outstanding goals. “[Dybala] chose a left-footed volley in a situation where 99 players out of 100 would stop the ball and then shoot. “The [Ronaldo] one, I think the amount of time he spent in the air before the header was incredibly long – a wonderful, physical and technical action.” Sarri’s men will now take on Cagliari in their next Serie A fixture.
