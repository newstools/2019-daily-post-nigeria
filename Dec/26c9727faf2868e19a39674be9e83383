The President of Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick, has said he will not relent in his efforts, to get Queens Park Rangers’ Ebere Eze to play for Nigeria. Speaking to BBC Sport, Pinnick noted that the England U-21 player will improve the Super Eagles squad. Eze was born in England to Nigerian parents but played twice for the Three Lions at Under-21 level in November. But Pinnick wants Eze to switch allegiances to boost Nigeria’s midfield, ahead of the 2022 World Cup. “We need to make a solid representation at Qatar 2022 and it starts with improving on your squad with quality players like Eze. “Can you imagine a midfield with Ndidi, Aribo, Etebo and Eze? it is one that will improve our squad. “I had a positive meeting with Ebere Eze in London and I spoke to his parents as well,” said Pinnick. “He requested for the chance to continue to focus on his club career which is going well so far, and that further progress will be made in due course. “But I am confidently hopeful that he will play for Nigeria soon,” he said.
