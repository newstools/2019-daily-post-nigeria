The remains of six people were recovered late on Friday from the wreckage of a helicopter that crashed at a mountainous state park on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Dpa reports that a seventh passenger on the chopper, which went down while touring Kauai’s Na Pali Coast on Thursday, had not been located. Officials discovered the crash site in Kokee State Park after rescue workers searched Friday morning amid windy, wet conditions. Two minors were believed to be among the passengers on the helicopter, according to the Coast Guard. “We are heartbroken by this tragedy and we continue to ask the public to consider the sensitive nature of this devastating situation. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of all victims during this extremely difficult time,” Kauai Mayor Derek Kawakami said in a statement.
