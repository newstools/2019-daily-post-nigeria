Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola has insisted that his assistant, Mikel Arteta would be allowed to leave Etihad, if he wanted amid interests from Arsenal. Guardiola said this following his side’s Premier League 3-0 victory over Arsenal on Sunday. DAILY POST had reported that Arsenal are looking for a replacement for Unai Emery, who was fired at the end of last month. Arteta is however the favourite to land the job. But Guardiola is now saying that he wants to avoid making Arteta feel “uncomfortable” at Man City. “Arteta has a lot [of influence],” Guardiola was quoted by Goal as saying after Man City’s win over Arsenal “He is part of the huge success we had. An important part. What will happen will happen. I think he is part of our staff so what is going to happen I don’t know. “At the end it’s personal, if he wants a job we are open to talk. I don’t want to make him uncomfortable.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
