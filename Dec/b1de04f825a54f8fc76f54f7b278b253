Everton’s caretaker manager, Duncan Ferguson, has admitted that he was happy to play out a 0-0 draw with Arsenal on Saturday Everton and Arsenal shared the point at Guddison Park as interim managers, Freddie Ljungberg and Ferguson took charge of their last matches. While Carlo Ancelotti is now Everton new boss, Mikel Arteta has taken over at the Emirate Stadium. Speaking to the BBC post-match, Ferguson said, “I think a point was fair. We struggled with our energy levels today and we lacked quality on the ball. “But it was a game of few chances, Arsenal probably had the best chance and our goalie [Jordan Pickford] made a fantastic save, but we’re happy with a point. “I think it was just fatigue. The boys gave me everything and they covered every blade of grass again, they had a good shape about them but just never really got that final ball or final pass to create the chance, but the players were incredible for me the past four games.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
