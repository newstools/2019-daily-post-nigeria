Super Eagles defender, Kenneth Omeruo, has revealed that he asked Fikayo Tomori to switch his international allegiance to Nigeria, before he became cap-tied to England. Tomori and Omeruo were both sent out from Chelsea on loan last season, but kept in touch via WhatsApp. Omeruo eventually completed a permanent switch to CD Leganes in the summer, while Tomori was brought into the Blues’ first team fold by manager Frank Lampard. “Tomori was a bit younger but he has really improved a lot. “Unfortunately for him he chose England. I wanted him to play for Nigeria! “(The WhatsApp messages) were good, the boys could catch up and share videos whenever a player made it into team of the week or was man of the match. That was a good connection,” Omeruo told the UK Sun. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
