Coal city came alive last Saturday as Guinness kicked off the much anticipated Guinness Night Football Series in a bold and extraordinary display of bright lights, high energy and extraordinary colour. Launching the Nigerian edition of the 5-A-Side football tournament, Enugu had players dressed in colourful glow-in-the-dark outfits, as the Ndi Igbo squad lit up fans in unrestrained frenzy, as it knocked out pundit favourite, Independence Layout. Taking football beyond its traditional format, Guinness Night Football brought colour, energy and vibrancy to the Enugu nighttime, cheering the moonlight hours with a wide range of immersive football extravaganzas, skills challenges and unique in-bar games. Football fans came away from this maiden edition with a whole assortment of Guinness infused prizes, in a night of amazing twists and infusions. Following its successful kickoff in Enugu, Guinness Nighttime Football this Saturday 28 December heads to Lagos for another extraordinary showing.
