Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane has disclosed that his side will knock Liverpool out from this season’s UEFA Champions League if both sides are to face each other in the last 16. Zidane’s men had already secured their place in the round of sixteen before their 3-1 victory over Club Brugge on Wednesday night. Real Madrid defeated Liverpool 3-1 when both sides clashed in the 2018 Champions League final. Asked about Monday’s round of 16 draws, Zidane was quoted by Evening Standard as telling reporters at his post-match press conference on Wednesday: “If we play Liverpool, we will eliminate them. “We can’t do anything about the draw.” Zidane added: “We were delighted with this win against Brugge, mostly because we put in a serious performance. I’m satisfied with the guys I chose and what they produced. “I reckon we deserved the three points because we were very effective in front of goal. Club Brugge had their merits, but we dominated the second half. “Obviously I’m thrilled for Vinicius and Rodrygo for their goals, but more for the quality of all-round game they produced.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
