Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, has called on political leaders in Nigeria to be selfless and display humility in line with the virtues of Jesus Christ as Christians all over the world celebrate Christmas. He also urged Christians to emulate the great virtues of love, peace, forgiveness and reconciliation, which he noted were the reasons for Christmas celebration globally. This was contained in a statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Ismail Omipidan, a copy which was made available to newsmen in Osogbo, the Osun State capital on Wednesday. “This is the season to humbly commune with God, thank Him for the gift of Christ. Let us love our neighbours and live in peace in the spirit of the season. “Our administration is poised to deliver sustainable development through the provision of adequate, equitable and qualitative projects in all the sectors across the state. “As part of efforts to transform the economy of the state, we convened the Osun Economic and Investment Summit to unlock the business potential of Osun and deliver a prosperous state where all the citizens shall have limitless opportunities to create wealth and contribute to the development of the state. “Our goal will be achieved when we all come together in love and peace, which is the whole essence of Christmas celebration. “I, therefore, urge you to show love to your fellow citizens as you go about celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ,” Oyetola stated.
