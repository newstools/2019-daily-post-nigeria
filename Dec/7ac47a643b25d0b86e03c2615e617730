Former Brazil international, Ronaldinho, has said that Lionel Messi cannot be called the greatest player of all time. Instead he named Diego Maradona, Pele and Ronaldo de Lima, as some of the best footballers ever. Ronaldinho spent five seasons at Camp Nou, where he won the FIFA World Player of the Year as well as the Ballon d’Or. The 39-year-old was also played alongside six-time Ballon d’Or winner, Lionel Messi, during his spell in Spain. However, speaking with Marca, Ronaldinho said: “I’m glad Messi won the Ballon d’Or. “We were also friends during our time at Barcelona. “But I don’t like to compare, and I find it difficult to say he is the best of all time. “There were [Diego] Maradona, Pele, Ronaldo… it’s hard to say that Messi is the best throughout the history of football. I can say he is the best of his era.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
