Arsenal playmaker, Mesut Ozil, has reacted to his side’s 2-1 defeat against Chelsea in Sunday’s Premier League encounter at the Emirates Stadium. Ozil said Mikel Arteta’s men did not deserve to lose against the Blues at home after their spectacular performances. Two late goals from Jorginho and Tammy Abraham gave Frank Lampard’s side all three points against the Gunners as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s first-half strike was not enough to savage a point for Arsenal. “Today’s result hurts after our best performance for a while,” Ozil wrote on Twitter. “We didn’t deserve to lose. But thanks for your amazing support at home this afternoon. We go again on Wednesday – together.” Ozil will now hope to lead Arsenal to victory when they take on Manchester United in their next Premier League clash on Wednesday.
