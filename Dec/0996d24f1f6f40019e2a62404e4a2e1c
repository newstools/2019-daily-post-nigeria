The pilot in command of the private jet informed the Air Peace pilot in command that a young man, obviously in his 20s, was trying to force his way into the aircraft. “The security wing of the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) was alerted and the man was accosted and whisked away,” Olisa said. He added that the man was already in the regulator’s custody and had been interrogated on why he took the action. Olisa quoted the man as saying that he thought the aircraft was heading for overseas.
