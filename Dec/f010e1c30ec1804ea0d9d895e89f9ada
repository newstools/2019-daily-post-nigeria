Pep Guardiola’s future at Manchester City, could depend on if the club gives him funds to sign new players next summer, The Athletic reports. The former Bayern Munich and Barcelona boss’ current contract expires in 2021. But it is rumoured that Guardiola has a break clause and could quit the Etihad as early as next year. Guardiola wants to overhaul his squad at the end of the season and is reportedly keen to sign at least one more centre-back, another left-back and a new forward. It is understood that he is unhappy with how this season has panned out, with City 14 points behind league leaders Liverpool before Christmas and wants to revamp his squad. After a trophyless first season, Guardiola led City to a silverware haul comprising seven out of eight of the domestic trophies available, including back-to-back titles and last season’s unprecedented treble.
