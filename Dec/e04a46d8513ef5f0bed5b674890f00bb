Deputy President of the Senate (DSP), Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, has expressed deep shock and grief over the death of Mr. Anthony Chucks Obuh, a one-time leading governorship aspirant in Delta State. Senator Omo-Agege recalled that Mr Obuh was a consummate bureaucrat in the Delta State Civil Service and served as Permanent Secretary in charge of his Office in 2007, while he (Omo-Agege) was the Secretary to the State Government (SSG). In a statement signed personally by Senator Omo-Agege, the DSP noted that, “Mr. Obuh was a thoroughly fine gentleman, friend and brother. He was a thoroughbred technocrat and a peaceful politician, committed to excellence in public governance. “I am saddened by the news of Mr. Tony Obuh’s reported demise. He was a very knowledgeable bureaucrat who had full and unique grasp of the finest details of the workings of public governance in our state. “As SSG in 2007, Mr. Obuh was the Permanent Secretary in charge of my Office. He was, without question, one of our finest public management technocrats in my time as SSG, and even thereafter. Mr. Obuh helped our State to make remarkable positive governance impacts”. The DSP extended his heartfelt condolences to Obuh’s family and friends whilst enjoining Deltans to remember them in their prayers at this very trying moment of losing such an illustrious Deltan.
