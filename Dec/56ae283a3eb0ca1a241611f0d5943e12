Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has confirmed that his side will be without the likes of Paul Pogba, Eric Bailly, Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Marcos Rojo when they take on AZ Alkmaar in the UEFA Europa League fixture on Thursday night due to injuries. The Norwegian also disclosed that Diogo Dalot and Nemanja Matic are back in his squad to face the Netherlands side. Solskjaer’s men head to the game after beating Manchester City 2-1 in the Premier League last weekend. Man United need at least a point against AZ Alkmaar to confirm top spot in the table, and a place among the seeds in Monday’s draw. “Diogo [Dalot] is back training fully,” Solskjaer told MUTV on Wednesday. “Nemanja [Matic] is back. [Marcos] Rojo is hopefully back next week. Eric [Bailly] and Timothy [Fosu-Mensah] are training with the team from next week onwards. “We’re getting better and better in that respect. In January, I reckon we will have many of them match fit.” Solskjaer added: “Paul is not ready to play but won’t be far away.” The kick-off time for the match is 9pm.
