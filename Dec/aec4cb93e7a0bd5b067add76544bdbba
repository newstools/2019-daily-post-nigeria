American heavyweight boxer, Deontay Wilder, has criticised British fighter, Anthony Joshua for the tactics he used in his victory over Mexican-American fighter, Andy Ruiz Jr on Saturday at the Diriyah Arena in Saudi Arabia. DAILY POST had earlier reported that in a bout earlier threatened by rain-storm, Joshua picked off a clear 118-110, 118-110, and 119-109 to defeated Ruiz Jr. in the highly anticipated fight. Ruiz stunned the boxing world when he knocked Joshua down four times before stopping him in the seventh round of their heavyweight world title fight in June. But the latest victory has handed Joshua back his WBO, IBF, WBA belts that were taken from him following his defeat to Ruiz in their first fight. “Joshua did what he had to do to get the win. He ran around the ring and was on his bike all day,” Wilder told The Athletic. “Basically, he had Klitschko in the camp and he was a lot like Klitschko: that jab-grab-hold method. That’s all he did tonight. “You want to dominate guys, man. Maybe I’m just too rough, too hardcore and too much of a dream for this time and era, maybe the world wants that nice shit… my mentality is so different from these other fighters. “But when I think of myself as a champion… you want to come out there and whoop his ass. “I’m not coming in, after losing to this guy, to just dance and grab and jab and hold. I’m going to show the world and convince them I am the very best and that no one is close to me, especially with what’s going on in the division right now. It’s a time of proving who is the best. “Joshua had many times he could’ve gone for the finish after he landed on the right hand.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
