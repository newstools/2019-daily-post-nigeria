Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has hailed his team’s Club World Cup victory over Flamengo. Roberto Firmino struck the decisive goal in extra time, after the Brazilian side battle hard against Klopp’s men. It is the first time the Reds would win the trophy. “We are exhausted from a very intense game but in moments of like this, I struggle to find the right words, to express my respect for the boys. “It was incredible, we did so many good things, everyone was on the edge pretty much and there were so many sensational, good performances,” Klopp told reporters after the game. Not for the first time in Liverpool’s run of success under Klopp, it was a late goal that decided the match. “Late goals – we don’t want to need them but they were necessary and important. “The boys have improved a lot over these months and when you start believing you believe through the full 90 minutes and in this case 120 minutes,” Klopp added.
