The All Progressives Congress, APC, in Ogun State has raised the alarm over an alleged planned attack on its secretariat located at Abeokuta and other offices of the party across the state. The Publicity Secretary of the party in the state, Mr Tunde Oladunjoye made this known through a press statement he sent to DAILY POST on Monday morning. The statement accused a politician in the state for being the brain behind the planned attack, as it called on security agencies to be on alert to thwart any break down of law and order. ” Intelligence at our disposal reveals that a known politician has made arrangements for thugs and miscreants to attack the State Secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Abeokuta this morning and to further attack and wreck violence across the wards in Ogun State. “It is important to recall that since the inauguration of the APC Caretaker Committees at the state, local government and ward levels by the National Working Committee of the Party on December 18, 2018, the former executive members had embarked on multiple litigations. ” The numerous suits are still pending in various courts. Why these people want to now take the laws into their hands and resort to self-help by their plan to unleash terror in different parts of the state is what we do not comprehend. “We call on law enforcement agents to be at alert to their duties and prevent break down of law and order in any part of our dear state. Peace has returned to Ogun State since the emergence of the new Administration, and it is the resolve.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
