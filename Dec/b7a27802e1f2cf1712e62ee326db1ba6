Chelsea have been offered the chance to take Isco from Real Madrid in a £44m deal, when the transfer window opens in January, the UK Mirror reports. Isco has spent six years at the Bernabeu, where he has won four Champions League trophies and one LaLiga title. However, the 27-year-old has fallen down the pecking order under Zinedine Zidane, starting just five of Real’s 18 league games so far this season. Madrid are ready to offload Isco, so they can bring in Christian Eriksen from Tottenham Hotspur. Chelsea are now free to sign players next month, after their transfer ban was lifted and manager Frank Lampard will be given up to £150million to spend.
