Arsenal winger, Nicolas Pepe, has said the squad is to blame for their poor form. The Gunners were beaten 3-0 by Manchester City on Sunday. It means they have now won once in their last 12 matches – a 3-1 victory at West Ham on Monday. Pepe, speaking to RMC after the game at the Emirates, said the players have to stand up and be counted. According to the Ivorian, even a change in manager may not yield much results. “It is us, the players, who need to rectify this. With Freddie (Ljungberg) or someone else, it would be the same,” he said. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
