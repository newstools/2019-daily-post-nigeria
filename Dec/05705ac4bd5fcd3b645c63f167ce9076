Former Arsenal star, Martin Keown, has claimed that playmaker, Mesut Ozil, decided to pull himself out of contention to face Everton in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon at Goodison Park. Ozil was not included in Arsenal’s squad that played 0-0 against Everton on Saturday due to a foot injury. But Keown is now saying that he was not convinced that Ozil was injured, adding that the midfielder took himself out from the clash against the Toffees because he taught the manager wouldn’t feature him. “I’m not convinced,” Keown told BT Sport. “What I will say is Freddie Ljungberg has managed with a great deal of dignity and a great deal of calm in difficult circumstances. “Ozil is one of those problems that Arteta must manage that. “He went off the pitch against City and he wasn’t best pleased. He didn’t look particularly injured on that occasion. “He probably just took himself out of it because he thinks Freddie wouldn’t play him. “Smith Rowe comes in today and I like the fact he wants to go with youth.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
