The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has stated that no amount of “smear campaign”, will stop it from using the National Identity Management Number (NIM) for the conduct of its exams. Ishaq Oloyede, the board’s registrar, said this on Wednesday, during a meeting with CBT centres, technical advisors, and service providers at the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, Kaduna state. Following JAMB’s decision to use NIM during the 2020 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), Oloyede said those benefiting from registration and exam fraud, are determined to mount a negative campaign. “With the current campaign against NIMC, I could see deliberate efforts at running the commission down so that we can consider not collaborating with them. Those benefiting from registration scandals are mounting a campaign against NIMC,” he said. “We are collaborating with NIMC. They are upright and just last week, five staff were sacked because they collected bribe. So as you interact with NIMC, don’t have it in mind that you are interacting with corrupt people, no, they are not. “Unless I’m wrong, more than 40 per cent of our candidates have obtained their NIN while the remaining ones are running helter-skelter to have theirs.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
