Following the judgement delivered by the court of Appeal in Jos, Plateau State on Friday, which upheld the victory of the Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the last 2019 election, the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) has vowed to seek redress at the supreme Court. State chairman of the party, Uba Nana, made the party’s intention to head to the apex court over the weekend during a stakeholders meeting held at their secretariat. “The judgment has been passed yesterday, we have received it. We are studying it and we are taking the next line of action. ” So, we will be heading to the Supreme Court. The case will terminate at the Supreme Court by the special grace of God,” he said. Nana explained that the stakeholders meeting was aimed at rubbing minds, reviewing how things were moving in the party with a view to taking corrective measures and strengthening the party. ” It is just to strengthen our movement and keep in touch with our teeming supporters. We cannot afford to lose contact with our teeming supporters,” he stated. Also speaking, the former deputy governor of the state Audu Sule Katagum said APC was still strong and formidable in the state having majority of members of the state assembly, house of representatives and all the three senators.
