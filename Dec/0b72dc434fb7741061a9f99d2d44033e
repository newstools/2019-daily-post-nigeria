Cristiano Ronaldo’s agent, Jorge Mendes, has said it was “an injustice” that the Ballon d’Or award was presented to Lionel Messi. Messi beat Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk and Ronaldo, to win the prize for the sixth time “The Ballon d’Or to Messi? For me it’s an injustice,” Mendes told Tuttosport at Monday’s Golden Boy Award ceremony in Turin. “Cristiano is the best in the history of football. Before him, Portugal had not won anything, with him the [2016] European Championship and the Nations League. “The Ballon d’Or? Had he played at Real [Madrid] he would have won it. He has transformed world football, in Portugal, at Real Madrid. It’s impossible to compare him to anyone.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
