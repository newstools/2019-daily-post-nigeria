A Chieftain of the All Progressives Grand Alliance(APGA) and the 2019 governorship candidate of the party in Abia State, Alex Otti has expressed dismay over the continued impoverishment of people of the State with draconian policies of Governor Okezie Ikpeazu-led administration. This came as the State chairman of APGA, Hon. Nkem Okoro, had in a statement during the week, carpeted the Abia government on the non payment of State workers, saying that it was both unlawful and ungodly to do otherwise given the amount of money the government receives every month. However, Otti, who spoke in a press statement issued to newsmen by his Media Assistant, Ferdiand Ekeoma on Friday in Umuahia, said, ” I sympathise with many Abians, especially civil servants and pensioners who might be struggling to have a good celebration due to economic challenges occasioned by bad governance and nonpayment of salary and pension arrears. “I urge Abians to remain faithful to God, and continue to be hopeful and steadfast, assuring that it’ is only a matter of time before God’s genuine plans for Abians come to accomplishment”.
