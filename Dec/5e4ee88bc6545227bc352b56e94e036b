The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP, on Saturday wrote to the United States President Mr Donald Trump over the re-arrest of the convener of RevolutionNow protest, Mr Omoyele Sowore. DAILY POST had reported that Sowore’s case got messier on Friday after DSS operatives allegedly chased out lawyers from the courtroom and attacked journalists and re-arrested Sowore. Following the invasion of the courtroom, the trial judge, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu adjourned the matter till February 11, 12 and 13 for definite hearing. This is coming less than a day after Sowore was released by the DSS after an Abuja Federal High Court ordered for his release within 24 hours. The Friday incident at the courtroom has since stirred reactions from well-meaning Nigerians. But SERAP in its letter made available on its Twitter handle called for the intervention of Trump, adding that Sowore is a husband to a US Citizen which compels him (TRUMP) to act. The letter reads: “Dear Donald Trump,Omoyele Sowore who is the husband of a US citizen Mrs Opeyemi Sowore, was violently re-arrested yesterday inside the courtroom after the court has granted him bail. “You’ve consistently committed to putting America first. That means speaking out for Sowore.” The group had earlier condemned the action of DSS on zgtiday describing it as a blatant attack on the rule of law and the sanctity and integrity of our justice system.
