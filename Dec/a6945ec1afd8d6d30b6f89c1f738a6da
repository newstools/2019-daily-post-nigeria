At least three people were on Wednesday night killed in Awka, Anambra State capital, after suspected members of cult groups clashed. The clash, which happened along the popular Ziks Avenue, near Eke Awka market, caused pandemonium in the area as roadside traders abandoned their wares and vehicles and fled for their lives. An eyewitness told DAILY POST that the men who operated on foot, shooting sporadically into the air were looking for members of a rival group, but later fled the area using a shuttle bus to a village in the town, Umubele, where they killed three persons. While one of the people killed was identified as Christopher Nzekwe Alias Ezeoke, a former head of vigilante group in Awka, two others who were also gunned down alongside him could not be identified. The Police Public Relations Officer of Anambra State Police command, SP Haruna Mohammed, while reacting to the incident in a social media forum for police and media personalities in Anambra, said the police were on top of the situation. He wrote, “Police have rushed to the scene,” he later added that, “His body (the slain former vigilante head) was taken to Amaku by Policemen led by DPO CPS Awka.” Haruna, however, did not take phone calls made to him for further enquiries on whether the culprits were arrested.
An indigene of the village, who claimed to be a neighbour of the slain Ezeoke, said he saw him driving out of his compound on Wednesday evening, and shortly after, the news came that he had been felled. Bodies of the three persons killed in the clash have been reportedly deposited in a morgue in Awka.Ends.
