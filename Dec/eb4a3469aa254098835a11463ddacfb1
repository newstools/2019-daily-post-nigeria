Leicester City defender, Ben Chilwell has revealed what former team-mate Riyad Mahrez told him about Manchester City’s gameplan after the hosts won 3-1 at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday. Mahrez scored Man City against his former club, netting the equaliser, and was a bright spark throughout. He caused Chilwell continuous problems down the left-hand side of Leicester City defence. With the win, Pep Guardiola’s side moved one point behind Leicester in the Premier League standings. Chilwell, who remains very highly-rated in the Premier League struggled to cope with the Algerian forward throughout the game. “I spoke to Riyad after the game and he said that was part of their gameplan, trying to get the wingers one-v-one,” he told Sky Sports. “It’s very difficult when they overload the wide areas, especially with the wingers they’ve got it makes it a very challenging game for us as full-backs, especially when it’s for 90 minutes. “Like I said it was a tough game for us, we tried to keep ourselves in the game for as long as possible but when they’ve got such quality and they’re clinical as well it makes it very difficult. I’ve had games up there, it was difficult. “For the whole game it was very tough but on the ball, second half, we tried to get on the ball a bit more and now we’ve got to look at the positives from the game. “Which was we tried to get on the ball second half, we did create a few chances and we’ve just got to look forward to getting back on the training ground Monday and then at the King Power Thursday – another great test (vs Liverpool).” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
