The lawmaker representing Imo West Senatorial District in the upper legislative chamber, Rochas Okorocha, has denied speaking to the press about the death of Senator Ben Uwajumogu of IMO North. The former Governor of Imo State made the denial via his tweeter handle, @realRochas. He expressed disbelief that a news outlet (not DAILY POST) will go to the extent of using his name to “break news.” He wrote: “I am utterly shocked that a platform like @TheNationNews would go to extent of putting my name behind such falsehood in the bid to break news. “Let me reiterate that I didn’t speak to journalists regarding the news making rounds about the passing of Senator Ben Uwajumogu. “I demand that @TheNationNews take down this news piece as it is false and completely misleading. One would expect better from such a platform.” DAILY POST reported earlier that Senator Ben Uwajumogu representing Imo North senatorial district slumped in his residence and died.
