The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has sought synergy with the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) to ensure the safety of corps members during and after the festive season. Oyo State Coordinator of NYSC, Eniola Ambekemo made the request on Friday when she paid a visit to the Sector Commander, FRSC Oyo State Command, Mrs Uche Winifred Chukwurah at the Command Headquarters, Eleyele, Ibadan. Ambekemo who said that the NYSC scheme and the FRSC have enjoyed a cordial relationship over the years said the visit was to harmonise with the Oyo State Command of the FRSC towards actualising the objectives of the campaign against road traffic accident recently launched by the management of the NYSC scheme in collaboration with the Federal Road Safety Corps. Chukwurah while reacting, pledged the command’s continued support for the NYSC and corps members in Oyo state. Chukwurah assured that the FRSC would be an eye for the NYSC scheme in its bid to ensure the safety of Corps members, whom she described as the pride of the nation. She, however, pleaded with the NYSC Coordinator to encourage the corps members to wear their uniform while travelling for easy identification. She also promised to facilitate a meeting between the Command, NYSC and independent transporters domiciled in Oyo State where issues of subsidized transport fare for corps members would be addressed.
