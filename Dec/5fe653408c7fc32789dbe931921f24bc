Villarreal manager, Javier Calleja has dismissed report linking winger, Samuel Chukwueze with a move to Chelsea. DAILY POST had reported that Chukwueze is believed to be on the list of wingers being targeted by Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard. Speaking on the development, Calleja said that Chukwueze should ignore the report and continue his development with Villarreal. “I think Samu is very grateful to everything Villarreal has given him. He is very young and has much to improve, and he knows it,” Calleja was quoted by Marca as saying. “It will be difficult for him to find a place where he is more comfortable and more familiar. That is a club like ours. “He must continue working because in future, he will have to face other experiences, know another league. ”He has time ahead and knows that he has the love of the fans and the total support of teammates and coaching staff.” Chukwueze, who has a release clause of €63million, was close to moving to the Premier League in 2017 to play for Arsenal, before he joined Villarreal. The 20-year-old has scored 11 career goals in 54 appearances for Villarreal’s first team and has provided five assists.
