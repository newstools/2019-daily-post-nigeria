Dr. Joe Okei-Odumakin, President, Centre for Change, has asked the Department of State Services (DSS) to produce the officers who acted in a “thuggish” manner on Friday. She also called on the federal government to stop embarrassing itself and ensure that the rule of law is respected. Operatives on Friday chased out lawyers from the courtroom and re-arrested Omoyele Sowore, convener of RevolutionNow. Following the invasion of the courtroom, the trial judge, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu adjourned the matter till February 11, 12 and 13 for definite hearing. In a statement on Sunday titled ‘Sowore:This is crossing The Line’, the renowned activist declared that the conduct of the DSS was vicious. Okei-Odumakin said: “Our attention has been drawn to the brazen and barbaric invasion of the Federal High court where Omoyele Sowore was being tried. “The gangsteric conduct of the men said to be DSS operatives which led to the chasing away of the presiding judge, harassment of lawyers and journalists and man-handling of Sowore was a crude assault on the hallowed seat of justice and further desecration of our judiciary. “Any society that tolerates this thuggish disposition of its security forces is lost beyond redemption. “The only way the government can attempt to prove it does not sanction this beastial conduct is to fish out those responsible for this barbaric conduct and ensure the rule of law is followed in the case of Sowore.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
