An Osun State High Court on Thursday, asked the Obalufe of Ife, Chief Idowu Adediwura to vacate his throne. Obalufe is the traditional Prime Minister of Ife and he is next to Ooni in rank.
The court also directed the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi to fill the stool with a candidate from the Aga Ruling House within 21 days Delivering judgment, Justice Foluke Awolalu of the Osun State High Court sitting in Osogbo, said the suit instituted by Abayomi Elugbuji held that the installation of Adediwura was not in accordance with the provisions of Ife Chieftaincy Declaration of 1957. The court held that going by the Ife Chieftaincy Declaration of 1957, it was the turn of Aga Ruling House to produce Obalufe and not Ajagbusiekun, where Adediwura that was eventually installed hailed from. The court also restrained Adediwura from parading self as Obalufe. Reacting to the ruling, counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Babafemi Akande, described the judgment as “sound and clear. “The law is very clear, nobody is above the law and no one is below it. So the judge gave the judgment in accordance with the dictates of the law,” Akande said.
