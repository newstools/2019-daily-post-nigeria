The Supreme Court will on Wednesday, December 18, hear the appeal filed by Hon. Adekunle Akinlade of the Allied Peoples Movement (APM), challenging the election of Gov Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, DAILY POST reports. Akinlade had earlier dragged Abiodun before the Ogun State Election Tribunal and the Appeal Court sitting in Ibadan, alleging that Abiodun’s election was marred with irregularities and that the Governor lied in the Form CF001 he submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). But his petitions were dismissed by the two courts for lacking in merit. Consequently, Akinlade proceeded to the apex court to test the strength of his case, expressing optimism that he would be favoured. In a message signed by Ibrahim Gold, Director/HoD, Litigation at the Supreme Court, and made available to DAILY POST, it was gathered that the appeal: SC 1438/2019, has been listed for hearing on Wednesday. The message reads: “Take notice that the above Appeal will be listed for hearing before the Supreme Court of Nigeria on Wednesday the 18th day of December, 2019. “And further take notice that in accordance with the Supreme Court Rules, this Notice is deemed sufficiently served on you if it is delivered on your telephone.
Signed:
Ibrahim Gold
