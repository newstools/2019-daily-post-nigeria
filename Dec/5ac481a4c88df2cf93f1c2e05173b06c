Senate Minority leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe has explained that disagreement during plenaries in the Senate was part of a thriving democracy, noting that there was nothing sacrilegious about it. Speaking at an opening remarks, to begin a luncheon/media briefing by the Senate President, Dr Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan at the Rockview Hotel, Abuja on Monday, the lawmaker maintained that Nigeria Senate remained united, despite disagreements on some national issues. Abaribe insisted that disagreement was unavoidable due to political, ideological and cultural differences, noting that after disagreement, there was always a point of convergence of views in national interest. He said: “It is a privilege asking me as a Minority leader to do the introduction of events which was organised by the majority. “This shows how closely we are working together. The Senate is one, that I can tell you despite seeming disagreements on some national issues. “We may disagree on the floor of the Senate. That happens in the interest of the nation. “We disagree because we all come from political, ideological and cultural differences and there is nothing wrong with that”, the Minority leader said. The Senate President was accompanied by Principal officers of the 9th Senate. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
