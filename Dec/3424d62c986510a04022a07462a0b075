Femi Fani-Kayode has congratulated Seyi Makinde, Governor of Oyo State over his victory at the Supreme Court. Recall that the Supreme Court had on Wednesday, upheld Makinde’s election as governor of the state. The appeal was filed by the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adebayo Adelabu. Adelabu lost to Makinde during the March 9, 2019 elections. The APC governorship candidate had approached the Supreme Court to challenge the appeal court ruling. The appellate court after evaluating the evidence brought by Oyo APC and its candidate ruled that the status quo should be maintained. However, Fani-Kayode in a tweet said: “Congrats to my friend and brother Governor @seyiamakinde
on his historic victory at the Supreme Court today! We give thanks to God for this victory!” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
