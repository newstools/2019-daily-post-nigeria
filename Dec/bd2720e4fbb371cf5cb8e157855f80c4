Former Manchester United star, Louis Saha has urged Arsenal board to appoint the club’s legend, Patrick Vieira as their next manager. According to Saha, Vieira who spent nine years with the Gunners and captained for three years with them is the “perfect fit” for Arsenal. DAILY POST had reported that Arsenal is currently searching for a permanent manager after the North London club sacked Unai Emery last month and appointed Freddie Ljungberg on a temporary basis. “I would love to see Patrick Vieira as Arsenal’s next manager; there are other contenders for the job but none as suitable as him,” Saha told Bwin ahead of Arsenal’s Premier League clash with Brighton on Thursday night. “I’m not saying that because he is my friend, he has done a great job in management over the years. “He has the heart of an Arsenal player and that’s what the club needs. He is a perfect fit for this Arsenal squad. “I’ve always been surprised that more ex-Arsenal players haven’t been involved with Arsenal as coaches under [Arsene] Wenger. “When I saw Patrick at Man City, it didn’t make any sense to me – he would have been perfect at Arsenal. “I used to hate Arsenal and that was because of Patrick and his team-mates; they were impossible to play against. “Arsenal needs that character back and he would be the best fit to take Arsenal forward.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
