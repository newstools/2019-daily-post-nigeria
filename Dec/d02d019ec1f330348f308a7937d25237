Another monarch at the town, the Oluro of Uro-Ajowa, Oba Timothy Ipinmoroti disclosed that Ajowa-Akoko remained one of the most hospitable communities in Yorubaland but the way the herdsmen came signaled suspicion and called for caution. The chairman of Ajowa Akoko community, Hon Bakare Ajayi revealed that Ajowa as a gateway town needs a lot of consciousness. “Besides the town has been battling with few herdsmen in their farms who usually used their cows to destroy their crops with also the security challenges of kidnapping in the axis. “They (Ajowa people) need to be security conscious as they saw in their luggage dangerous weapons like axes, sharp cutlasses and sword. Reacting, one of the herdsmen simply identified as Issa Ahmed disclosed that some indigenes took money from them before they decided to come for settlement. The Area Commander and Assistant Commissioner of Police for Ikare-Akoko, ACP Razak Rauf who confirmed the incident, said the police had commenced investigations on the issue.
