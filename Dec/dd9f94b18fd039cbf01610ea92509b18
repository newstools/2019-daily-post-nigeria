Former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has pleaded with politicians to stop killing the masses during elections. Jonathan said that what happened in the last governorship election in Bayelsa and Kogi States was something that should not happen in any normal society. Making reference to the Peoples Democratic Party’s women leader who was burnt to death in her house, in Kogi State during the polls, the ex-president said something is fundamentally wrong with the political system. He said that politicians were resorting to political coups as a substitute for military coups, critiquing the phenomenon as bad the continent. Jonathan stated this at the weekend while speaking on behalf of other awardees at the convocation ceremony of Igbinedion University Okada, in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State. “What happened in the last governorship elections in my state, Bayelsa State, and especially in Kogi State, where that young lady was burnt alive in her house, is something that should not happen in any normal society. Something is fundamentally wrong with our political system,” the former President stated. “Only yesterday in Ndjamena, we were discussing the politics of our continent, most of us former Heads of States, Presidents, former Presidents, Vice Presidents. “The way African politics is going we are replacing military coup with political coup d’etat and that cannot sustain the continent. “Let me plead with my fellow politicians, they should stop killing people,and destroying properties because people want to own offices,” he said.
