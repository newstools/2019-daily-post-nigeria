Manchester United, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has called for the club’s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, and the board to get transfers done quickly next year. Solskjaer was left light in attack, after the late departures of Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez. The Norwegian has had to contend with injuries to both Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial this season. United signed Harry Maguire from Leicester six days to the start of the new season, in an £80million deal. Solskjaer, speaking ahead of Wednesday’s home fixture against Tottenham, made it clear he wants his squad virtually settled by July ahead of the 2020/21 season. “We do have a clear picture of what the squad is going to look like in June, July. “Hopefully, you get as much done as soon as possible. With Harry coming in, Romelu going out, it was late. We do have a plan now,” he said.
