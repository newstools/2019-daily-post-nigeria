An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court on Monday ordered that a labourer, Samuel Ezeh, should be remanded in Kirikiri Custodial Centre for allegedly robbing at knife point.
Eze, 21, was accused of robbing a pedestrian of his mobile phone. Chief Magistrate Mrs G.O. Anifowose refused to take the defendant’s plea and ordered that he should be kept at the custodial centre until Jan. 24, to allow the court to seek advice from the director of public prosecutions. The defendant, who resides at Fatima Street in Ikotun, near Lagos, is being tried for conspiracy and robbery, NAN reports. The Prosecutor, Sgt. Felicia Okwori, had told the court that the offences were committed on Dec. 3 at Ojudu area of Ikotun. Okwori said that Eze and some others at large, robbed one Azeez Badmus of his mobile phone, valued at N25, 000 at knife point. The prosecutor also alleged that the defendant and his accomplices robbed the complainant on his way home from work. “The complainant shouted for help and the defendant was apprehended,” Okwori said. The offences, according to the prosecutor, contravene Sections 297 and 299 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
