There were no hard feelings between Arsenal players and Jorginho, following their 2-1 defeat to Chelsea on Sunday, the UK Metro reports. Jorginho controversially avoided a second yellow card, before making it 1-1, after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had opened scoring. The Italy international, already on a yellow card, cynically pulled back Matteo Guendouzi as he broke away, but referee Craig Pawson did not book him. Jorginho then popped up minutes later to level the scores. Tammy Abraham snatched all three points for the visitors following a swift counter attack. Despite the controversy, Arsenal skipper Aubameyang laughed and joked with the midfielder in the tunnel after the game, before exchanging shirts. David Luiz also shared a chat with his old teammate, hugging Jorginho and also chatting with Mateo Kovacic and N’Golo Kante.
