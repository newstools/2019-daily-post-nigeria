Former Manchester United defender, Gary Neville has described playmaker, Mesut Ozil’s performance in Arsenal’s 2-1 defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League on Sunday as ‘good’ Chelsea defeated Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, thanks to two late goals from Jorginho and Tammy Abraham. However, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang did score for Mikel Arteta’s men in the 13th minute of the encounter. “He’s been good,” Neville told Sky Sports. “We saw less of him in the last 10-15 minutes as Chelsea grew in the game but in that first hour, we saw a lot of quality and class. “Ozil contributed enormously to this Arsenal performance and he’s getting a great reception.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
