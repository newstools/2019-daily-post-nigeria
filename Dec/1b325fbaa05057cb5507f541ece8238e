Former Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has spoken about the club’s decision to replace him with Mikel Arteta. The 48-year-old was sacked last month, after an 18-month spell in charge ended with a seven-game winless run. Manchester City assistant boss Arteta was announced as the new Gunners boss on Friday. Emery, speaking to BBC Sport, insists the Gunners are making “a good decision” by appointing his compatriot. “He really is prepared to make that next jump. “He has been at Arsenal before, he’s been in the Premier League and he has been working with Pep Guardiola. I do believe this is a good decision and I would also like it to be a good decision,” Emery said.
