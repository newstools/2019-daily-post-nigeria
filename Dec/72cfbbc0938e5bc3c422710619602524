Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has fired at Chelsea defender, Antonio Rudiger, for his role in Son Heung-min’s red card during their 2-0 defeat on Sunday. Mourinho sarcastically suggested that Rudiger must have suffered “broken ribs” in the incident. Speaking to Sky Sports after the game, the Portuguese insisted that Son should not have been sent off, despite the South Korea forward kicking out at Rudiger. “Rudiger for sure is having scans in the hospital on broken ribs, because it was really a violent situation. “In some countries like mine for example with our culture, we used to say ‘clever player’. “But in this country, and one of the reasons why I fell in love with this country in 2004, is because we don’t call them clever. We call them other things, that I refuse to call him. “For me, it is not a red card. I think if we go to every person in this room, some will say yes, and some will say no. “And that’s not the essence of the VAR, the initial protocol of VAR. VAR is for the penalty of the first half, a clear and obvious mistake; 65,000 people in the stadium looked to the screen and they knew it was a penalty. For me that’s VAR. “When you have that situation with Son and Rudiger, it’s not a clear and obvious mistake by the referee. I think the mistake of the referee is not to give a yellow card to Rudiger. Because the way he fouls Son, that is the clear mistake. “But then VAR goes to the Son situation, which I believe is not. “In some opinion, people will say yes, but that’s not for VAR. So for me, it’s really, really bad, and basically kills the game. It’s the slow-motion, it’s the angles, everything,” Mourinho said.
