The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has confirmed the final 10 nominees for the 2019 African Player of the Year award. CAF had initially released a list of 30 players. But the Nigerian duo of Wilfred Ndidi and Victor Osimhen have been dropped. Two-time reigning champion Mohamed Salah has once again been nominated, alongside his Liverpool teammate Sadio Mane. Algeria, who won this year’s AFCON, have three players that were included: Manchester City winger Riyad Mahrez, AC Milan midfielder Ismail Bennacer and winger Youcef Belaili. Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who lifted the crown in 2015, also made the cut, with Ajax duo of Andre Onana and Hakim Ziyech. Senegal’s Kalidou Koulibaly and Nigeria international Odion Ighalo will also compete for the award.
