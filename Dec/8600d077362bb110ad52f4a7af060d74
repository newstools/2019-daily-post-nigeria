Nigeria’s former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has claimed that four people fought from within President Muhammadu Buhari’s government, to ensure the release of Omoyele Sowore, convener of RevolutionNow Movement, and Sambo Dasuki, former national security adviser (NSA). Writing on his verified Twitter page, Fani-Kayode listed them as Buhari’s Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari; Ekiti state Governor, Kayode Fayemi; the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami and Aviation Minister, Hadi Sirika. “I can tell you authoritatively that 4 people fought from within to get Dasuki & Sowore released and eventually managed to convince Buhari. “They are Abba Kyari, Malami, Hadi Sirika and Kayode Fayemi. They represent the liberal and cerebal wing of the Buhari Govt. And I commend them,” he tweeted. Sowore and Dasuki were both released from the Department of State Services custody on Tuesday, December 24. Sowore was arrested on August 3 over a nationwide protest, while Dasuki has been in detention since 2015. Although Sowore was released temporarily after 124 days, he was rearrested at a Federal High Court in Abuja less than 24 hours after.
