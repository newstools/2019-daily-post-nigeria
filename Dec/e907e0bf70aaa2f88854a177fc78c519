The Nigeria Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in Enugu State, on Tuesday, said it arrested no fewer than 159 illicit drug traffickers in the state from January to November 2019. The command also said that no fewer than 59 drug traffickers were convicted within the same period while others were at various stages of prosecution. Mr Adeyemi Adeofe, the NDLEA Commander in the state, disclosed this on Tuesday in Enugu. Adeofe said that the command recorded tremendous achievements in its efforts to reduce the scourge within the period under review. He said that the command during the period seized 2.4kg of Cannabis Sativa, 100kg of Ephedrine, 836 grams of methamphetamine and 78. 9 grams of cocaine. “We also discovered and dismantled a clandestine laboratory used in the production of methamphetamine,” he said. Adeofe said that drug abuse has become a major social, health, economic and psychological problem in the country. The commander urged the youths to stay away from drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking in order to safeguard their future. In a goodwill message, Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi pledged the support of the state government in curbing illicit drug trafficking and abuse in the state. Ugwuanyi, who was represented by his Special Adviser on Special Duties, Mr Uwakwe Azikiwe, said that the rating of the state in the drug abuse chart in the South-East was not encouraging. ”Enugu State wants to be known for something positive and we shall give the command our maximum support to achieve this,” he said. The governor, however, said that prevention of drug abuse was the responsibility of all including parents, society and peer groups. Ugwuanyi urged the youths not to succumb to the temptation of peddling or abusing drugs.
