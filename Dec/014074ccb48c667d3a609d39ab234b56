Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodgers, on Saturday, featured Kelechi Iheanacho and dropped Jamie Vardy from his side’s squad that defeated West Ham United 2-1 in the Premier League, because the England striker’s wife, Rebekah gave birth to a baby girl on Friday, Metro UK reports. Vardy, who is currently the Premier League highest goals scorer with 17 goals, was a notable absentee against the Hammers as goals from Kelechi Iheanacho and Demarai Gray gave the Foxes all three points against West Ham. “Over the moon to let you know our beautiful little girl has arrived. “Becky and baby are both doing well and we are all totally in love with the newest member of our team,” Vardy wrote on his Twitter page on Saturday. Meanwhile, speaking after his side’s win over West Ham, Rodgers singled out Gray for praise after the 23-year-old’s brilliant display against the host. “Gray has been fantastic for me,” Rodgers told post-match conference. “He’s not always started for me, but he’s come into games and made an impact. “You have to show a real character when you miss a penalty early on. He kept going, his body language was good. “His run and finish was absolutely brilliant. So it’s a big credit for him and it’s great for confidence.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
