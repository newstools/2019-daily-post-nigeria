Zailani Bappa and made available to newsmen in Gusau, the state capital. According to him, “The decline was done two weeks after the swearing in of all Commissioners and Special Advisers in which he was assigned the portfolio of the Ministry of Education,” he said. According to the statement, “The governor had vowed for a constructive and meaningful observations and reasons for any of his commissioners to resign his appointment, but the paltry and shallow arguments of non fulfilment of promises to the people and failure to mention them is nothing but a political joke,” he stated . “It is, therefore, unfortunate that personal and selfish considerations will becloud the vision of trusted confidants at a time when all hands must be on deck to begin a new era in the history of Zamfara State,” the statement noted. The statement, however, said that the Governor wishes Alhaji Jamilu Aliyu Zannah all the best in his future endeavours.
