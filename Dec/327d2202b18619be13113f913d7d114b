On Wednesday, a High Court sitting in Port Harcourt struck out the originating summons brought by one Ibrahim Umar and twenty-two others against the APC. The court also set aside the interim injunction obtained by the claimants on the 14th September, 2019 which stopped the APC from conducting the congresses in Rivers State scheduled for 17th, 18th and 21st of last September. Delivering the judgment, presiding Judge, Justice G.O Ollor ruled that the court lacked the power to enforce and interpret the judgment of the court of coordinate jurisdiction. Justice Ollor also held that the interim order of injunction obtained by Ibrahim Umar and others was gotten without jurisdiction of the court and thereby set aside the order and thereafter awarded one hundred thousand Naira as cost in favour of the APC.
