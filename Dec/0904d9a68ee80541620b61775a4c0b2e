Former Premier League referee, Dermot Gallagher has explained why Everton’s goal was not disallowed in their 1-1 draw with Manchester United on Sunday. Everton’s goal came after Dominic Calvert-Lewin collided with Manchester United goalkeeper, David de Gea in the penalty box. The ball then bounced off defender Victor Lindelof and went in as an own goal for Everton. After VAR’s check, the goal was allowed despite the incident. Gallagher told Sky Sports, “I honestly don’t think it’s a foul. When you watch it, De Gea comes out and flaps at the ball. “They [De Gea and Calvert-Lewin] are both in the air and Calvert-Lewin does have an arm across him, but the ball is gone. There’s going to be inevitable contact at this point. “I think the contact has happened afterwards. He’s come out and flapped at the ball for whatever reason, they’re both in the air and there is going to be a collision, there’s no doubt about that, but I think it happens after the ball has gone past him.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
