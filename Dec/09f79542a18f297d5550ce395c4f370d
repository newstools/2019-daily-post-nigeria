The lawmaker expressed concerns over “allegations of intimidation and extortion of huge sums of money from universities in order for their programmes to be accredited. “We are worried that the alleged monetary demands for accreditation may have led to some universities increasing their tuition fees so as to meet up with the demands of the NUC Accreditation teams,” he stated.
