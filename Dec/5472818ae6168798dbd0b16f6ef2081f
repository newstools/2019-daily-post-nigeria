Tottenham boss, Jose Mourinho has reacted to the red card on Heung-Min Son in Chelsea 2-0 win in their Premier League clash on Sunday. The Portuguese also said that the alleged incident of racism towards Chelsea’s Antonio Rudiger “saddens” him. Mourinho spoke to a post match press conference after Willian scored twice to give Frank Lampard a well deserved win over his former boss. Mourinho admits “Chelsea were superior to Tottenham throughout the game” but added that “the goals were caused by his players’ mistakes.” The former Chelsea boss added that “Heung-Min Son should not have been sent off.” The Spurs boss said that VAR was correctly used for the first-half penalty decision but not on Son’s violent conduct on Antonio Rudiger. “Antonio Rudiger was speaking too much to his players during the game but the alleged racism towards the defender is very disappointing,” Mourinho said.
