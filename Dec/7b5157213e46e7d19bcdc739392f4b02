Former Chelsea player, Tony Cascarino has revealed the club’s major problem this season under their manager, Frank Lampard. According to Cascarino, the Blues’ biggest problem this term is that Lampard’s men get ‘frustrated’ so easily on the pitch when the game is not going their way. He said this following Chelsea’s 2-0 home shock defeat to Southampton in the Premier League on Thursday. “Chelsea’s first season under Frank Lampard is becoming a rollercoaster,” Cascarino told The Times. “Since a run of seven straight victories in September and October, Chelsea have gone 13 games in all competitions without recording back-to-back wins. “One match they outclass Tottenham Hotspur, the next they are losing 2-0 at home to Southampton. “Tammy Abraham, the 22-year-old striker, has scored only four goals in this 13-game run and when he is not firing, Chelsea do not seem able to compensate for a leaky defence. “The problem is that when this youthful team do not get their way, they become frustrated.” Chelsea will now take on Arsenal on Sunday in their next Premier League fixture at the Emirates Stadium.
