Leicester City striker, Jamie Vardy, has expressed confidence that his side can hurt Liverpool when both teams clash in the Premier League on Thursday night at the King Power Stadium. Leicester head to the game following a 3-1 defeat to Manchester City in their last Premier League encounter. “I think we were pretty confident in our ability, but we knew that we had to show that game by game,” Vardy told Leicester City’s official website on Tuesday. “I think at the minute we’re where we deserve to be. “We just have to go into the game against Liverpool the same as any other game. Like I said, we know we’ve got a lot of talent and a lot of ability and we know that we can hurt teams when we’re playing at our best. He added: “We’re a bit disappointed with the result against Man City, but it’s all about dusting ourselves off now and getting ready for the Liverpool game.” The kick-off time for the match is 9pm.
