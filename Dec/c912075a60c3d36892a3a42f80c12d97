Manchester United defender, Harry Maguire, said Jesse Lingard’s embarrassing first-half miss, was a turning point in their 2-0 defeat to Watford on Sunday. Before the hosts scored through Ismaila Sarr and Troy Deeney, Lingard had the chance to give United the lead. Instead he lifted the ball over Ben Foster and out of play. Maguire, speaking to Sky Sports after the game, admitted the chance was crucial for United. “He knows he has to score. That was a big chance in the game. The first goal is crucial. I missed one against Newcastle and we went on to lose. “He has missed it, we moved on. We still had to go on and win the game but we didn’t. “We were not good enough and we have to improve. It is something we cannot put our finger on. We are working hard in training. It is disappointing,” he said.
