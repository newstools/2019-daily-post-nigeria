Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has admitted that they are still suffering from the manner of their past two Champions League exits, but must “start from scratch” this season. The Spanish giants were eliminated on away goals in April 2018, after squandering a 4-1 aggregate lead over Roma. They lost 3-0 in the second leg of their quarter-final tie at the Stadio Olimpico. Liverpool then overturned a 3-0 deficit at the semi-final stage last season, winning 4-0 at Anfield. Barca have qualified for the last 16 again, but Messi has urged his team mates to forget what happened in the past, when the knockout stages commence in February. “To be honest, it’s always there,” he said of the painful Champions League eliminations at an Adidas event on Wednesday. “But we have to start from scratch. It’s a new year, a new competition. Obviously we have to learn from mistakes, but to think of the present and the future. “We must forget what happened last year and the year before, it would be a mistake to think of that.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
