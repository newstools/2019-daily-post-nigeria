UEFA Champions League holders, Liverpool have agreed to a £7.25 million transfer deal with Red Bull Salzburg forward, Takumi Minamino. According to the Daily Mail, Minamino will move to Liverpool when the transfer window opens in January. Minamino missed Salzburg’s final game for this year against Hartberg on Saturday as he set to complete his transfer move to Anfield. The Japanese international was impressive for Salzburg when they took on Liverpool in the Champions League some few days ago, scoring a fine volley against Jurgen Klopp’s men at Anfield. The 24-year-old has scored nine goals and provided eleven assists in twenty-two appearances for Salzburg so far this campaign. Minamino has also played for Cerezo Osaka in the Japanese top flight league. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
