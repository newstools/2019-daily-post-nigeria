Ebonyi state governor, Dave Umahi, has inaugurated a 7-member committee to investigate the altercation between the chairman of Ohaukwu Local Government, Clement Omekannaya Odah, and the lawmaker representing Ohaukwu South constituency, Chinedu Onah. Odaa, on Wednesday, allegedly slapped the lawmaker and although he denied it, the assembly passed a resolution ordering for his immediate arrest and prosecution by security agencies.
The fracas, which occurred inside the state House of Assembly, was over the list of Management Committee Members for the local council areas. Odah was said to have accused the lawmaker of conniving with some people to deny four management members from Ohaukwu south from participating in the ongoing screening. Speaking at the Government House, Abakaliki, on Friday, Umahi announced that the committee which had Chief Franklin Ogbuewu, former Minister of Culture and Tourism, as Charmian, has 14 days to submit its report.
“Let me condemn the behaviour of the chairman for going there in the first place, it is wrong”, he said. “I don’t want to talk about what happened there and we can imagine a House member going to a commissioner’s office to quarrel not to talk of a hallowed chamber of the house. “Everywhere in the world, the parliament’s chambers are sacred places that people don’t desecrate and this made us set up a committee of neutral persons who are neither members of the House of Assembly nor State Executive Council,” he said.
