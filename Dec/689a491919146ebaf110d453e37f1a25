The All Progressive’s Congress (APC) Zamfara State, has asked Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle to urgently release two of its chieftains in custody. Ibrahim Danmaliki Gidangoga and Bello Gamji Dankande are currently in custody over alleged offences against the state. Speaking with DAILY POST in Gusau, chairman of the party, Alhaji Lawali Liman Laura said the detention was illegal and such action would not give room for corrective government in the state “I want to call on the good people of Zamfara state to note that we are not practising democracy in this state but autocratic government because I don’t see anywhere in the whole world where freedom of speech can be compromised,” he lamented. According to him, Bello Mohammed Matawalle should be very much aware that he is the father of all as God has given the power to govern Zamfara state for the benefit of all in the state. “I would not like to join issues with him but let him not be deceived about the political issues because I’m not fighting with him, God Almighty has given him power to rule Zamfara state. Liman assured that his members would be obedient to the government of the day, stressing that APC in the state has been warned to respect the law of the land. Speaking further, Kaura noted that with the arrest of the two APC members, the situation in the state has become unbearable, even for grassroots supporters. Kaura warned that if Governor Matawalle continued in the manner he is handling the people of the state he would be disappointed by the grassroots whom he said are the majority in the rural areas of the state.
