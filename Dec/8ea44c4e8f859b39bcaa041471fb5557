Bayern Munich star, Thomas Muller has named Callum Hudson-Odoi and Christian Pulisic as the two Chelsea players that can hurt his side when both side’s clash in the UEFA Champions League round of 16 fixtures on February 25 and March 18. Muller said this while reacting to the Champions League round of 16 draws that was released earlier today [Monday]. “With Chelsea, I haven’t seen a lot of them besides their results, but it doesn’t seem to be going so well at the moment,” Muller was quoted by Metro UK as saying. “But of course they have players in their attack who can hurt us. Hudson-Odoi and Christian Pulisic have qualities but football is not about individuals, it’s about team performance. “We are relatively confident, I feel pretty good with the draw. You [the German media] have already planted Bayern as the favourite, I like that, that’s exactly what we want.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
