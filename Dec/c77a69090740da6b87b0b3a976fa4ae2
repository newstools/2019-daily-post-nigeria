An Ejigbo Magistrate Court in Lagos State has sentenced one Olayemi Olowo, a mechanic to 12 months imprisonment for defrauding his customer to the tune of N150,000. The complaint, Noah Okeke, is said to be Olowo’s regular customer who usually got his vehicles repaired at his workshop at Peter Agha Street, Ejigbo. The prosecutor, Kenneth Asibor, explained that sometimes in August 2019, Noah asked Olowo, being a mechanic, to help him get a mini bus popularly called korope. He explained: “They both went round on market survey to get the price and Olowo being a mechanic, was thought to know the best vehicle. The two of them, after the survey, concluded that they could get the bus at the rate of N150,000, which was given to him (Olowo) at the Jari Filling Station, Oke-Afa Ejigbo, Lagos to get the bus. “After collecting the money, the defendant disappeared with the money and was nowhere to be found. “The complaint then reported the matter to the police who later arrested Olowo and charged him to court after he had confessed to the offence.” At the court sitting, the defendant pleaded guilty of the offence. The presiding magistrate, Mr. Teslim Shomade, therefore sentenced him to 12 months imprisonment with hard labour with the alternative of N100,000 fine.
