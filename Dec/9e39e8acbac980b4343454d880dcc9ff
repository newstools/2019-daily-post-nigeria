Femi Falana, Senior Advocate of Nigeria, has demanded the immediate release of Omoyele Sowore, convener of RevolutionNow Movement. Falana explained that his call for Sowore’s release became necessary after two lawyers from his team, who visited the Department of State Services, DSS, to effect the activist’s freedom were told to take their request to the Attorney General of the Federation, AGF, Abubakar Malami. In a letter to the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, Falana said: “Following the announcement of your decision to take over the case of the Federal Republic of Nigeria V Omoyele Sowore and another, two members of the legal defence team visited the headquarters of the State Security Service on December 13, 2019, to demand the immediate release of Sowore from illegal custody. “Our colleagues were however, advised to direct the request to your office in view of the fact that you have taken over the case from the State Security Service. “In the light of the foregoing, we hereby request you to use your good offices to direct the State Security Service to release Sowore from custody in line with the order of the Federal High Court admitting him to bail pending trial. “We are confident that you will not hesitate to grant our request as no court has issued any remand order for his detention.” Following his re-arrest by operatives of DSS at the Federal High Court in Abuja on December 6, 2019, Sowore has remained in detention. Against the backdrop of Sowore’s re-arrest, Malami had ordered the DSS to hands-off the trial of the activist and hand over his case file to the office of the AGF.
