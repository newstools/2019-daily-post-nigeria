Argentine football legend, Diego Maradona, has told former Tottenham manager, Mauricio Pochettino, to take charge of “the biggest team in the world” Boca Juniors. Pochettino has been linked with Manchester United, Arsenal and Bayern Munich since he was sacked last month. Maradona has advised him to return home, after Gustavo Alfaro stepped dow at Boca. “I will not go to Boca… because I repeat that I do not agree with those who will manage the club,” Maradona told Ole. “The president [Jorge Amor Ameal] was already there and it was a disaster, he surrounded himself with [vice-president Mario Pergolini] who believes that he can handle the club. “And Roman… a club is not run within the locker room. It’s much harder than stopping the ball, giving a pass or kicking a free-kick. “Boca have to take a technician to play and feel what Boca is. It’s not easy to sit in that chair. The best of all is Maradona [laughs]. “But now I will not go, there at some point it happens. But I would like Mauricio Pochettino. You have to call him and convince him to come to lead the biggest team in the world.” Maradona added: ” I want to finish in the best way. First I want to save Gymnasia [from relegation], then we’ll see.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
