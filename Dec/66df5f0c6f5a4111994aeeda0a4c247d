Manchester United coach, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has confirmed that the club will not sell midfielder, Paul Pogba when the January transfer window opens. DAILY POST had reported that Pogba is still determined to force his way out of Old Trafford and is keen to leave as early as January amid interest from Real Madrid. The France international is yet to feature for the Red Devils since September 30, because of a foot injury. Pogba was expected back in action this week, but a mystery illness has further delayed his comeback. He also missed Man United’s 3-0 victory over Colchester in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday When asked if Pogba would leave Man United in January, Solskjaer was quoted by Sky Sports as saying on Friday at his pre-match press conference ahead of the Red Devil’s Premier League clash with Everton on Sunday: “He’s not getting sold in January, no. “He’s training but he’s not been training with us for long. He’s training and that’s a step forward for us. “Yeah, of course (I understand all the interest around him) because he’s a fantastic player, a charismatic personality and for us we’re happy that he’s here.” “When he comes back, play well, play with a smile on his face and do what he did a year ago when I came here,” Solskjaer added. “Paul was fantastic. He has been fantastic when he’s played for us. “We know that we’ve got one of the best players in the world when he’s playing well, when he gets fit. “He needs time to get fit, of course but he’ll make a difference for us.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
