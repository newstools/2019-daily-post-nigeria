Manchester City will be without Sergio Aguero and John Stones, for Sunday’s Premier League game with Arsenal. David Silva is also doubtful for the match at The Emirates. “(Stones) has a muscular injury. “I don’t know how long. (Aguero) still hasn’t trained with the team. “(Silva) couldn’t train yesterday or today but tomorrow we will see. “It was a kick in the leg that was painful,” Guardiola told a press conference on Friday. The champions go into the game 14 points behind leaders Liverpool, after losing 2-1 to Manchester United last weekend.
