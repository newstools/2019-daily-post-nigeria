Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has claimed Manchester City are “the best team in England”. Both teams will clash in the Carabao Cup semi-final following Wednesday’s draw. United claimed a 3-0 win over League Two side Colchester United at Old Trafford, while City saw off Oxford 3-1. Solskjaer’s men won the derby 2-1 over City in the Premier League earlier this month and the teams will meet again across two legs in January. “[They will be] fantastic days in Manchester. They’re the best team in England and we’re confident going into the semi-final. “Of course, we do really respect them and, as I said after the derby last time, in my opinion, they are the best team in England. “They can out-football you so we need to get our game heads on and be ready for them again. “But we’ve shown them that we can cause them problems. I think they will be two fantastic games,” Solskjaer said, according to Goal. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
