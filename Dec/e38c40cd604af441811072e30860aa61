The Chairman/CEO, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, (NIDCOM) Hon. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, has assured that the two Nigerians in Bosnia Camps are hale and hearty. Two students of the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO), Abia Alexandro Uchenna and Eboh Kenneth Chinedu, who attended an international table tennis competition in Croatia, ended up in a Bosnian refugee camp. Dabiri-Erewa, in a statement on Friday, said arrangements have been concluded to send the two Nigerians back to Croatia anytime from Friday December 13, adding that the Nigerian Mission in Hungary has taken steps to ensure that the matter is resolved and the welfare of the two Nigerians protected. She said that five of them went for the table tennis event without the knowledge of the Nigerian Table Tennis Federation, two returned over two weeks ago, three of them stayed back while one already applied for asylum. “Although the Croatia Authorities through our Ambassador in Budapest denied the allegation involving maltreatment by the Croatian Police, the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Geoffrey Onyeama has demanded full investigation into the matter”, the statement noted. Dabiri-Erewa said the conditions attached to their release include usage of their return tickets from Zagreb, Croatia back to Nigeria and that they must not seek Asylum in Croatia, just as one of them did already. She appealed to Nigerians to always inform relevant authorities whenever they go on such trips outside the country and be of good behaviour.
