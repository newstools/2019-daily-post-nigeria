Dillian Whyte has claimed that Deontay Wilder will avoid a fight with him, by becoming ‘franchise’ champion, despite his reinstatement to the WBC rankings, according to Sky Sports. The ‘franchise’ status has been handed out by the WBC to reigning champions Saul ‘Canelo’ Alvarez and Vasiliy Lomachenko so far. This means they are not bound by mandatory obligations. Whyte was, on Wednesday, reinstated as interim champion and will become mandatory challenger to Wilder’s current belt in February 2021, after he was cleared by UK Anti-Doping amid accusations of an “adverse finding” in a drug test. “Now I’m back he will definitely move up to ‘franchise’ world champion,” Whyte said about Wilder. “I want to fight Deontay Wilder. I’ve wanted to fight him for a long time, I still want to fight him, but he doesn’t want to fight me. It’s clear he doesn’t want to fight me. “I just want to become world champion. “Wilder will move to ‘franchise’ champion so I might become world champion soon anyway.” Undefeated Wilder plans a rematch with Tyson Fury in February, after battling to a split decision draw a year ago.
