The Deputy Governor of Edo State, Philip Shaibu, says the administration of Gov. Godwin Obaseki was not distracted by the political crisis in the state. He warned opponents not to take his principal for granted because of his desire for peace. The Deputy Governor stated this in a chat with newsmen at his residence in Benin on Friday. While noting that the mandate was to transform the state, he stressed that the Obaseki’s administration had not deviated from this mandate. Shaibu, who said the administration would not be deterred by the current political crisis in the state, however, said that Obaseki was someone who should not be taking for granted. He said as a governor who was democratically inclined, Obaseki had assured that the process leading to the next year governorship election would be fair. “The people fighting the governor today have taken him for granted; the governor is a believer in democracy and I can tell you that next year election in the state will be peaceful. “The governor is passionate about the development of the state and what we are doing now to transform the state will be sustained in the second term of the governor,“ he said. The governor and his successor and national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) are at loggerheads over political differences. The situation had split the Edo APC chapter with executive members taking sides in the battle.
