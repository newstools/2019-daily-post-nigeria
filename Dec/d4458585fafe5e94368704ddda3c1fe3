Arsenal playmaker, Mesut Ozil, was caught by television cameras shouting ‘Laca’ immediately after his side’s 2-1 defeat to Brighton in the Premier League on Thursday night, before the midfielder gestured angrily towards the Gunners’ bench. Ozil stormed down the tunnel but continued to look annoyed as he walked past Arsenal’s interim assistant manager, Per Mertesacker, who was standing in the technical area. Arsenal were beaten 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium by Brighton, leaving caretaker coach, Freddie Ljungberg still searching for his first win since he replaced Unai Emery last week. Goals from Adam Webster and Neal Maupay gave Potter’s men all three points against Arsenal. However, Alexandre Lacazette did score a goal for Ljungberg’s men. The result against Brighton means, Arsenal are now in the tenth position on the Premier League table with 19 points from 15 games. The North London club will take on West Ham United in their next Premier League fixture on Monday night.
