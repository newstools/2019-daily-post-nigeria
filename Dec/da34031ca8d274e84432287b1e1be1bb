Legal luminary, Femi Falana, has alleged that there was a third term agenda for President Muhammadu Buhari. The Senior Advocate of Nigeria stated that soon, Nigerians will start seeing manifestations of the ‘plot’. He spoke in reaction to a suit by a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) that the National Assembly should amend the constitution to allow Buhari to contest again. Falana told Sunday Tribune: “I hope Nigerians have not forgotten that when the Babangida-led junta was going to extend its tenure, we had the Association for Better Nigeria (ABN) that went to court that the 1993 presidential election should not hold. “We thought it was a joke. So, very soon, Nigerians will have other manifestation over the third term agenda.” Recently, Buhari declared that he had no third term plan. At the APC National Executive Council meeting in Abuja, the President explained that both age and the country’s constitution prevents him from staying beyond 2023. His words: “I’m not going to make the mistake of attempting a third term. “Besides the age, I swore by the holy book that I would go by the constitution and the constitution said two terms. “I know that I’m in my last term and I can afford to be reckless because I’m not going to ask for anybody’s vote.” Last Tuesday, the House of Representatives rejected a bill seeking to provide for a single tenure of six years for president and governors. Critics say the strategy behind the bill was to push it to become a law and take effect from 2023 to allow Buhari re-contest. The bill was sponsored by John Dyegh from Benue State. But during the debate, most of the lawmakers kicked against it, arguing that there is nothing wrong with the system Nigeria currently operates.
