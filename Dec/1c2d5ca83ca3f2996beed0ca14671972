A Staff of Kaduna Electric has been assaulted and severely injured by a customer who resisted having his property disconnected for failing to settle the current charges on his electricity bill. This was disclosed on Wednesday in a statement by the Company’s Head of Corporate Communication, Abdulazeez Abdullah where he said the Management of Kaduna Electric has decried the spate of assault on its staff by some members of the public while carrying out their legitimate duties. He noted that, the company will pursue to its logical conclusion all such cases and ensure that perpetrators are brought before the law. According to the Spokesman, the latest incident which occurred last Tuesday at Unguwan Muazu, Rigasa Area Office, involved one of its linesmen, Ahmed Buratai, who was assaulted and left severely injured by a customer who resisted having his property disconnected for failing to settle the current charge on his electricity bill. “Although the culprit is still at large, the matter has since been reported to the police who have vowed to ensure he is apprehended,” Abdullah said. The Head of Corporate Communication in the statement said the electricity company operates a zero tolerance to default in bills payment, warning that any customer who fails to pay shall be denied power supply.
