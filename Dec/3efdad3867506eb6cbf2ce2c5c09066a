Arsenal chiefs have finally decided to appoint Manchester City’s assistant coach, Mikel Arteta as the club’s new manager. According to Sky Sports, the Gunners bosses held talks with Arteta at the Spaniard’s house following Arsenal’s 3-0 loss to Manchester City in the Premier League on Sunday at the Emirates Stadium. The newspaper reports that Arsenal’s chief executive, Vinai Venkatesham and chief contract negotiator, Huss Fahmy, were spotted leaving Arteta’s house in the North West London in the early hours of today [Monday]. DAILY POST had reported that Arsenal is looking for a replacement for Unai Emery, who was fired last month. Arteta is, however, the favourite to land the job. Arsenal’s interim manager, Freddie Ljunberg has already urged the club’s chiefs to speed up their process of appointing a new manager after their humiliating defeat to Man City. Meanwhile, speaking on Arteta’s situation, Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola said that the former Arsenal midfielder would be allowed to leave Etihad if he wanted. Guardiola said: “Arteta has a lot [of influence]. In the end, it’s personal, if he wants a job we are open to talk. I don’t want to make him uncomfortable.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
