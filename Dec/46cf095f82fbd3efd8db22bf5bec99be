Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has “forbidden” his players, from watching their Bayern Munich horror show. The Bundesliga champions thrashed Tottenham 7-2 at White Hart Lane in October. Both sides meet again in the Champions League on Wednesday, with Mourinho choosing to rest Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Serge Aurier and Jan Vertonghen. However, the Portuguese does not want any of his players to be battle scarred, before tackling the big-scoring Germans at the Allianz Arena. “7-2? I forbid any image about it. I watch it a couple of times with my staff and the analysts, try to go through every detail but not one single image for the boys not at all. “We are going to focus on us, more than Bayern, to develop our model of play with different faces and diff bodies but there is a certain way we try to develop and we are totally focused on us and less on Bayern,” Mourinho told a press conference on Tuesday.
