Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has named incoming Arsenal coach, Mikel Arteta as the ‘right manager’ to take charge of the Emirates club. Arsenal are expected to confirm Mikel Arteta as their new manager, before their trip to Everton in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon. Arteta has agreed to a three-and-a-half year’s contract with the Gunners. The 37-year-old will earn £5million annually at the Emirates, the same wages Unai Emery was on. But Solskjaer now believes the Spaniard can restore the ‘culture and DNA’ of Arsenal established under former Gunners manager, Arsene Wenger. Asked at his press conference on Friday if Arteta is the ‘right manager’ to lead Arsenal forward, Solskjaer was quoted by Metro UK as saying: “Yeah I think so. “If you know the DNA and culture of the club, if you’ve been here especially in periods when the club’s done well, you see what the culture is. “I think that’s important, build on what’s been going well and improve on what you think should be improved. Guardiola is probably the best example, what he did with the Barcelona team.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
