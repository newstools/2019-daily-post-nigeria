Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodgers has hailed Manchester City playmaker, Kevin De Bruyne as a “world-class” player, following his side’s 3-1 defeat against Pep Guardiola’s men in the Premier League on Saturday. De Bruyne put in a spectacular performance, as Man City claimed an important victory at the Etihad. Man City fell behind to a Jamie Vardy goal, before Riyad Mahrez made it 1-1. Ilkay Gundogan converted from the penalty spot and De Bruyne’s powerful run set up Gabriel Jesus to make it 3-1. “In the first half we weren’t good at all,” Rodgers told Sky Sports. “It actually shows how well we’ve done to be where we are. Against that level of opponent, it was a good lesson for us. No complaints about the result from me. “We were a little more like ourselves in the second half but it showed there’s a long way to go for this group of young players. When we did have the ball we showed we could hurt them. “Like the goal, Jamie was outstanding all evening, it was a great pass by Harvey. But it shows there’s a long way to go so tonight we have to keep that humility. “We have to respect the quality of opposition we were against tonight. Technically they’re on another level and Kevin De Bruyne was world class tonight. “To be ahead of City at this stage of the season shows how well we’ve done. We were better second half and for us it’s about that continual growth as a squad.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
