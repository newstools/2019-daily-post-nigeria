Former Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand, has predicted that Liverpool will win the Champions League, ahead of next week’s last-16 draw. All the sides that will be in Monday’s draw for the first knockout stages, have been confirmed following Wednesday’s fixtures. Holders Liverpool qualified for the last 16 as group winners, alongsideManchester City, Paris-Saint Germain, Bayern Munich, Juventus, Barcelona, RB Leipzig and Valencia. Chelsea and Tottenham went through in second place in their respective groups, along with Real Madrid, Atalanta, Atletico Madrid, Napoli, Borussia Dortmund and Lyon. Group winners will be drawn against runners-up in the round of 16, although they cannot face teams from the same country or those who were second in their group. Looking ahead to next week’s draw, Ferdinand said on BT Sport: “Liverpool just look the most complete team. “They have got that mentality now. They were on the cusp of winning for a few years and they got over the line last season. “They look like they are going to win the Premier League and they have that mentality that they aren’t going to lose. They know they are going to win.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
