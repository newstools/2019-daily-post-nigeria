Cristiano Ronaldo has disclosed that he would be interested in acting after retirement. The 35-year-old superstar’s Juventus contract runs until 2022. Speaking at weekend at the Dubai Sports Conference, Ronaldo said: “When I quit football I would like to resume my studies “I focus a lot on studying, on learning, because unfortunately the studies I have done can’t give answer all the questions I have in mind. “One thing that fascinates me is to want to try acting in a film.” On his retirement plans, Ronaldo stated: “I always play with the intention of winning. “The moment my body no longer responds in the right way on the pitch, then it will be time for me to stop. “Many years ago the ideal age to retire was 30 or 32, now you still see players aged 40.” Ronaldo is in Dubai for the Globe Soccer Awards. He is nominated for Best Men’s Player alongside Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah.
