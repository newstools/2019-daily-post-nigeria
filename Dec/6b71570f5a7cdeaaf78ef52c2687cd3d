Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard has confirmed that Tomori Fikayo and Ruben Loftus-Cheek will miss his side’s Premier League clash against Bournemouth due to lack of match fitness and injury. Lampard’s men head to the Saturday’s game following a 2-1 victory over Lille in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday. “Tomori is not fit for Saturday’s fixture,” Lampard was quoted by Football London as saying during his pre-match press conference on Friday. “Hopefully he will be training next week. Loftus-Cheek, probably more than weeks.” Lampard added: “We have to worry about Bournemouth tomorrow and the other games before the window opens.” The kick-off time for the match is 4pm.
