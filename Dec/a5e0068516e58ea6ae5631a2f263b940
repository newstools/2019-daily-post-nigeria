The President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, has pledged to run non-partisan leadership in the National Assembly. NAN reports that Lawan stated this on Saturday in Damaturu, Yobe State capital at a reception in his honour. “I can take it upon myself to run a non-partisan Senate, where party does not determine what we do. What we do could be determined by the interest of Nigeria. “Every Nigerian, regardless of his political party, wants to see an economy that works and also wants to live in peace,” he said. Lawan appealed for the support of Nigerians to the lawmakers to enable them achieve success. “I want to use this opportunity to appeal to Nigerians to continue to support us in the National Assembly; to advise us and to guide us where we are wrong or where we are about to be wrong,” he said. Lawan commended his colleagues for their cooperation and being focused in discharging their duties.
