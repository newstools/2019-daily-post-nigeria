The Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi has reacted to the decision of President Muhammadu Buhari to release a former National Security Adviser, NSA, Sambo Dasuki and convener of #RevolutionNow protests, Omoyele Sowore from detention. Fayemi said Buhari’s decision had once again shown that he is a stickler for due process and an apostle of the rule of law. This was contained in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, Fayemi. He said that Buhari’s gesture, which came on the Christmas Eve, was a good Christmas gift for Sowore and Dasuki their families and associates as well as a soothing balm for the country. Fayemi said, “Again, the President has demonstrated that he is the father of the nation through his intervention that led to the release from detention of the two prominent citizens.” This, he said should be the norm. “The President, by this intervention, has reinforced the fact that nobody is deemed guilty of an offence until pronounced guilty by a court of competent jurisdiction. “This is good for the country. We congratulate Col. Dasuki and Sowore and salute the President for the fatherly gesture,” the Governor added.
