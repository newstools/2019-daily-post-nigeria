The Abia state government has closed down all private Nursery, Primary and Secondary Schools presently operating in Residential buildings, Warehouses, Church halls, Village and Town halls in the State. Commissioner of Education in Abia state, Dr. Kanelechi C.K. Nwangwa, in a statement issued to newsmen at the weekend in Umuahia, disclosed that the State government took the step to ensure that the Abia Child was properly educated in the right environment and by the right teachers. According to the statement which read partly, “Parents that have their wards in these schools should use this holidays to make all necessary arrangements to relocate these pupils/students to Government and Approved Schools having standard School compounds. Parents are particularly encouraged to take advantage of the free education program as well as the School Feeding Program of the Government to take their wards to Government Schools instead of these closed down Schools. “Any School Proprietor that has a school in any of these above-mentioned places that fails to comply to this directive and decides to open by January will have himself/herself/themselves to blame for any severe measures that will be applied. “Parents are strongly advised to make sure they will not continue to patronize these Schools. The education of the Abia Child is so important that we cannot continue to allow people to toy with such issues”.
