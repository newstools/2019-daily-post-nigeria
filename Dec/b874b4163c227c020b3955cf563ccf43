The Nasru-L-Lahi-L-Faith Society (NASFAT) in Lagos State on Monday, cautioned all Muslim faithful to be careful of what they do and put on social media. The former president of the association, Alhaji Kamil Bolarinwa, gave the warning while speaking with journalists at a reception for the new NASFAT President, Alhaji Olaniyi Yusuf, in Lagos. He also urged Muslims all over the country to be security-conscious and alert as the year comes to an end, NAN reports. According to Bolarinwa, security is not only for government, all of us must be security conscious and alert. “You must be aware of your environment and people you mix up with. When you are travelling, watch the road. “Most importantly, be careful what you do on social media. Be careful about the information you put about you or your family on social media,” he said. Bolarinwa urged the new NASFAT president to do his best and put in everything to move the society greater. He advised every NASFAT member and the public generally to keep safe and be positive while also praising Allah. “It is the end of the year and we know it is relaxation time but also it is a time to move closer to God and plan for 2020,” he added.
