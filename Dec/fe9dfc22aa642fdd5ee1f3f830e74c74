The Association of about 21,780 Disengaged Teachers in Kaduna State have cried out for the payment of what is due to them from Governor Nadir El-Rufai after two years of sack. Registering their ordeal through their spokesman, Joseph Audu, the over 21,000 disengaged teachers in the state said their endless wait for their benefits have subjected them to lots of untold hardship. The spokesman said the benefits included outstanding salaries for different months, leave grants ranging for years, gratuity, among others benefits. Mr. Audi said, “We are not fighting the governor for anything but all that we are saying is that he should look at our predicament and please give us what belongs to us. “The past two years, many of us have not had it funny, some have died, others are sick and cannot not treat themselves, others cannot train their children, while others have either been driven from their rented houses or have parted ways with their wives for their inability to maintain them.” He explained that the governor had earlier told the world that he has paid the disengaged teachers all their benefits, stressing, “Governor El-Rufai should please intervene on our behalf so that those holding our money could release it to us.” Also, a disengaged teacher from Igabi local government area of the state, Hajiya Nafisat Bello pleaded, “We came here in peace. We are not here to fight the government but to plead with governor El-Rufai to please know that since our disengagement two years ago, We have been living like beggars. “We have served the state in our little way and all that we are saying is that that which belongs to us should be given to us so that we start a new life by helping our families.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
