Manchester City ace, Riyad Mahrez is reportedly upset after heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua flirted with his wife Rita in a nightclub, The Sun, UK reports. The newspaper reports that Rita and Joshua were ‘chatting intently’ and her hand was on the British fighter’s knee at boxer’s VIP table in the trendy Manchester nightspot, popular among big-spending footballers and WAGS on Friday. “Rita bumped into AJ on her way out and he invited her to join him at his table in VIP,” a source told The Sun. “Rita, who was with a female pal, clearly thought AJ was incredibly hot. They then spent much of the evening laughing and flirting. “He didn’t have a clue who she was. He simply thought she was a pretty girl and enjoyed their chat. “But when the club owner pointed out she was Riyad’s wife, AJ got a bit awkward, and totally backed away. “He explained he didn’t want to step on any toes or cause a scene, and that he’d be stupid to be seen doing anything in public. They left with friends at 3am, but got into separate cars.” A spokesman for Joshua told the publication: “Anthony was approached in the nightclub and politely declined all advances.” DAILY POST recalls that Joshua’s heavyweight rival, Deontay Wilder was also said to have flirted with Mahrez’s wife some few weeks ago. Rita married Mahrez in August 2015 and has two young children with him. The couple have agreed to a trial split and are living 200 miles apart from each other.
