Manchester United goalkeeper, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has defended David de Gea, after his howler helped Watford to a 2-0 win on Sunday. It was only the Hornets’ second Premier League victory of the season. The hosts took the lead thanks to a shocking mistake from De Gea, who attempted to catch a scuffed shot from Ismaila Sarr, but saw the ball go through his hands. Troy Deeney slotted home a penalty four minutes later to snatch all three points. “It was a mistake, it happens in football and it is what we train for every day to make sure they don’t happen again. “David has been very good lately, it is just one of those things that happen. It’s one of those things. “He’s been so good in training and focused. One goal is a mistake and the second is penalty. David’s been very confident lately and I don’t look at it any other way,” Solskjaer told Sky Sports.
