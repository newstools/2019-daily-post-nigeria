Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on Wednesday confirmed he is interested in signing striker, Erling Haaland from Red Bull Salzburg. DAILY POST had reported that Solskjaer is eager to land Haaland to Old Trafford in order to bolster his attacking options in January following the departure of Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku from the club last summer. Haaland played under Solskjaer during their time at Molde, where he scored 26 goals in 18 matches in all competitions. The 19-year-old has been impressive for Salzburg so far this season, scoring 28 goals in 22 matches. He is currently among the highest goal scorer in the 2019/20 UEFA Champions League with eight goals so far. “Erling Haaland is a player I like,” Solskjaer told Norwegian television channel Viasport after Man United’s 3-0 win over Colchester in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night. “We are looking for good players all the time. Erling has had a good development, so he has to develop further wherever he decides. “I don’t need to talk so much about him, but we as a team always look for players who can complement the others we have, and then we see what we end up with.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
