Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has told Nemanja Matic and Marcos Rojo, that they are free to leave the club in January, the Daily Star reports. Both Matic and Rojo have fallen out of favour at Old Trafford, with the pair making just six Premier League appearances between them this season. Solskjaer has informed the players they do not have futures at the club, with executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, ready to sanction their exits. Matic, 31, is now deemed surplus to requirements, having dropped behind Scott McTominay, Fred and Paul Pogba in Solskjaer’s pecking order. Rojo, who was signed for £16million in 2014, has not featured under Solskjaer for over a month and is likely to move abroad.
