Liverpool have confirmed that their manager, Jurgen Klopp, has signed a new contract extension that will keep him at Anfield until 2024. The UEFA Champions League holders made this known in a statement on their official website on Friday. The statement read: “Liverpool Football Club are delighted to announce Jürgen Klopp has agreed a contract extension with the club. “The manager will extend his Reds tenure until 2024, ensuring he will remain at the helm for a further four-and-a-half years. Assistant managers Peter Krawietz and Pepijn Lijnders have also agreed deals to continue working collaboratively alongside Klopp. “The deal comes after four hugely successful years in charge of Liverpool for the 52-year-old and will ensure the long-term foundations for the team’s – and indeed club’s – development will continue well into the next decade.” Klopp, speaking on why he signed a new deal, told the club’s official website: “For me personally this is a statement of intent, one which is built on my knowledge of what we as a partnership have achieved so far and what is still there for us to achieve. “When I see the development of the club and the collaborative work that continues to take place, I feel my contribution can only grow. “People see what happens on the pitch as a measure of our progress and although it is the best measure, it’s not the only measure. I have seen the commitment from ownership through to every aspect and function of the club you can think of. “When the call came in autumn 2015, I felt we were perfect for each other; if anything, now I feel I underestimated that. It is only with a total belief that the collaboration remains totally complementary on both sides that I am able to make this commitment to 2024.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
