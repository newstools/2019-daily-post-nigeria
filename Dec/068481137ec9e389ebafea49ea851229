A 27-year-old man, who specializes in the cultivation and sale of Cannabis Sativa, commonly known as Indian hemp, has been apprehended by operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, in Uso community, Owo Local Government Area of Ondo State. The suspect identified as James Austin was nabbed with 798kg of the illegal plant. It was gathered that Austin, a native of Benue State, was arrested at 1.30 a.m. in his house following a tip-off. Confirming the development, the state Commander of the NDLEA, Haruna Gagara who spoke through the Public Relations Officer of the agency, Wilson Okechukwu said the agency had already strategized on how to rid the state of illicit drugs and psychotropic substances. “The middle-aged suspect had arranged the cannabis sativa in a nearby bush very close to his house before he was arrested. “This arrest made in Uso has gone a long way to reduce drugs which would have been carried to other places. This is dangerous to society, particularly during this ember period. ”As you know there is no end in the fight against drug abuse, our men are on ground raiding the black spots in the state,” he said.
