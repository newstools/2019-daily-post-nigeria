The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has said its intervention had assisted to save N4.5 billion monthly, lost to ‘ghost workers’ on the federal government’s payroll. A statement issued by EFCC Spokesman, Mr Wilson Uwujaren, quoted the commission’s Acting Chairman, Mr Ibrahim Magu, as saying this while delivering a lecture on Thursday at the National Defence College (NDC) in Abuja. Magu, while commending the introduction of Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) into salary payment said, “The involvement of the EFCC in tackling the scourge of ghost workers in the civil service has led to a redemption of over N4.5 billion naira monthly. “The EFCC has been engaged in eradicating ‘ghost workers’ from the federal government’s payroll which has resulted in saving as much as N4.5 billion naira monthly. “The Bank Verification Number (BVN) has been an effective tool in carrying out investigations effectively, as it has curtailed the opening of fake bank accounts by fraudulent individuals. “The only gateway to development is through fighting corruption. “If Nigeria breaks away from corrupt practices in government businesses and in the private sector, we will transform into a model state overnight,”NAN quoted him as saying. He added that 70 per cent of it was achieved between 2016 and September 2019 under his watch. The EFCC, boss, therefore, called for more collaboration among security and law enforcement agencies through the National Anti-Corruption Strategy aimed to bring about coherence and synergy among security agencies in the country.
