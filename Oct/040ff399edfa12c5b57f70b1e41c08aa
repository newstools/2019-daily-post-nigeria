Arsenal striker, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, has blasted Borussia Dortmund CEO, Hans-Joachim Watzke and labeled him a ‘clown’. Aubameyang said this after Watzke claimed the Gabonese international joined Arsenal for money. DAILY POST recalls that Watzke has claimed Aubameyang was motivated by money when he left the club, who unlike Arsenal, have competed in every Champions League campaign since. Watzke told Suddeutsche Zeitung, “Of course it is hard to keep a player in the face of such sums. “Some go to clubs because of this money, where they have not played Champions League for years. “Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who plays great at Arsenal, will probably be warm-hearted when he looks at his bank account, but on Wednesdays, will be saddened when he has to watch the Champions League on television,” owever, Aubameyang, who has scored 49 goals for Arsenal since joining the club, hit back on social media, labelling Watzke a hypocrite over Dortmund’s sale of Ousmane Dembele to Barcelona in 2017.” Reacting, Aubameyang wrote on his official Twitter page on Thursday: “Better for you I never talk about why I really left Dortmund Mr Watzke, you such a clown. “I remember that time you said we never going to sell Ousmane then you saw more than 100M, you were the first to take that money. Don’t talk about money please!!! Leave me alone pls.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
