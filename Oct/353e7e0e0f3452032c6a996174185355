Cristiano Ronaldo’s agent, Jorge Mendes, has insisted that his client’s best is yet to come after the Juventus forward scored his 700th career goal for club and country. According to Mendes, Ronaldo is far from finished because he’ll surpass Brazil legend, Pele as the best scorer in football history, adding that the 34-year-old will do it at Juventus. DAILY POST recalls that Ronaldo, on Monday night scored his 700th career goal in Portugal’s 2-1 defeat to Ukraine in Euro 2020 qualifier encounter. “His numbers don’t lie and light up the overwhelming way Cristiano Ronaldo shatters records, which elevate him to the category of best player in the history of football, with a big difference compared to the second [best] for all he achieved with the different clubs he represented, whether in England, Spain or now in Italy and also with the Portuguese national team,” Mendes was quoted by Eurosport as saying on Wednesday. “The fact is that with Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal have already played in three Finals, winning two of them. “Cristiano has reached the remarkable milestone of 700 goals, but I have no doubt that he’ll surpass Pele as the best scorer in football history, and he’ll do it with Juventus. “After all, 68 goals aren’t a lot for this extraordinary Cristiano Ronaldo, are they? It’s also because I’m convinced that his best is yet to come.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
