The Chairman of Benue State Council of Traditional Rulers, Tor Tiv, Prof. James Ayatse, on Wednesday, spoke on the recent triumph of the President at the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal (PEPT). Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) defeated presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar. The tribunal stated that the petitioners (Atiku and the PDP) failed to prove any of the grounds of the petition as known by law and consequently discarded the petition in its entirety. Speaking during a visit to the State House in Abuja by a delegation of Benue monarchs, Ayatse, described the outcome as “God-given victory”. He said the outcome was to enable Buhari complete the “mandate to reconstruct, rebuild and unify the country and take it to the Next Level of socio-economic development.” “We are here to pledge our support and encouragement to your administration and its laudable programmes,” he added. In his response, Buhari expressed delight with the leadership of the Tor Tiv and other traditional rulers in their various communities as well as for their strong support for his administration. He promised to look into the “long list” of the delegation’s demands, and thanked the royal fathers for showing appreciation for what his administration has done in the State in terms of projects and appointments.
