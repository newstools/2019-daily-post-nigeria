Former Liverpool and Blackburn Rovers defender, Stephen Warnock has singled out Nigeria international, Wilfred Ndidi, for his performance in Leicester City’s 9-0 win over Southampton at the weekend. Leicester’s massive win over the Saints has become the highest away win in the English Premier League. Speaking on Sky Sports in the review of the matches played over the weekend, Warnock said, “The whole (Leicester) team played well. The defence, the midfield. Ndidi was so clever in the middle of the park. “He (Ndidi) plays just like Fabinho at Liverpool. And when you have a player like that, it just frees other players to play their games.” Ndidi played the entire duration of the match, making it his ninth league game so far this season for Leicester with one goal to his name.
