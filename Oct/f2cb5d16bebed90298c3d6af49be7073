Nigeria international, Asisat Oshoala struck a brace on Saturday as Barcelona beat Real Madrid 4 – 0 in Spanish Primera Iberdrola. She also stole the show in Madrid with a woman-of-the-match display. A goal in each half from Oshoala plus Jennifer Hermoso and Aitana Bonmati’s strikes guided Barcelona past Madrid’s women side in the encounter. Oshoala, who was in action for only 68 minutes, has now scored in five successive games for Barcelona and has eight goals in 11 games in all competitions this season. However, fellow Nigerian, Chidimma Okeke who plays for the Galacticos ladies was taken off in tears as she suffered a potentially serious injury at the 25th minute of the game on Saturday.
