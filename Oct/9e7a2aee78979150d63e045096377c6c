Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has said Paul Pogba’s lack of fitness and his current mindset at Manchester United, have hindered his performances under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer this season. Pogba has failed to find his best form this term and missed United’s Premier League clash against Newcastle United, due to an ankle injury. Wenger believes Pogba’s ankle problem has contributed to his average displays. “First of all, I think Paul Pogba, since the start of the season, has never been completely fit injury wise. “He doesn’t look, I’ve seen him the other night against Arsenal, he doesn’t look completely confident physically and he’s the type of player who has a huge physical power. “He needs to be perfectly fit physically. “After that, when a player wants to leave and you stop him from leaving, you know you go through a process of rebuilding the relationship that the first thing that suffers is the performances. “I personally think he behaves as well like he knows that Man United at the moment is not the team to compete for the championship. “And, plus the fact that he was stopped from going away, it looks like the two together a little bit tarnish his performances,” Wenger told beIN Sports.
