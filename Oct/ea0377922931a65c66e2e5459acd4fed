Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, has nominated Edward Onoja, his running mate in the November 16 election, as the deputy governor of the State. NAN reports that Onoja would be sworn in on Saturday. This comes after the Kogi State House of Assembly impeached Simon Achuba over alleged gross misconduct. Achuba had fallen out with Bello shortly after he was sworn into office. Onoja formally resigned his position as Chief of Staff to Bello this week. He was the chief strategist of “Yahaya Bello Campaign Organization” in 2015 and the State Director of the Kogi Youth Arise Group, which worked for the success of President Muhammadu Buhari also in 2015.
