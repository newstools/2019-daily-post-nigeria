Juventus manager, Maurizio Sarri, has insisted he will not stop Cristiano Ronaldo taking free kicks within scoring range, despite the player’s poor record for the Serie A champions Ronaldo has taken 29 free kicks for Juventus since he joined the club before the start of last season and failed to score with any of them. Seven were saved, two missed the target and 18 went straight into the wall, with two making it past the wall after deflecting off it. Ronaldo wasted two more attempts during Tuesday’s Champions League match against Lokomotiv Moscow, leading to criticism on social media and in Juventus blogs, especially as the team has two other expert free kick specialists in Miralem Pjanic and Paulo Dybala. Sarri gave little attention to the problem, when asked about it at a news conference on Friday. “The free kicks? We have two right-footed options on the pitch: him [Pjanic] and Ronaldo. So they will have to decide among themselves who takes them, as happens in just about any other side,” he said.
