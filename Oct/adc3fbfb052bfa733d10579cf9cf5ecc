The National Association of Polytechnic Students, (NAPS) has expressed deep concern at the paltry amount allocated to education in 2020 budget. NAPS noted that of the total sum of N10.33tn budgeted by the federal government, N48bn (6.9 per cent) was allocated to education. A statement by the National President of National Association of Polytechnic Students, NAPS, Comr. Mohammed Eneji and made available to newsmen in Kaduna, advised government at all levels to brace upon education in Nigeria. The statement explained, “We charge the Federal Government of Nigeria led by President Muhammadu Buhari to give more priority to education in Nigeria by dancing to UNESCO tone of 26 per cent allocation at all level, it will enhance the proper funding of our educational system and in no time, we would have world class institutions where research work will be done.” The association also called on other state governors to emulate the governor of Kaduna state, Mallam Nasir El-rufai who enrolled his son in a public primary school within the state. The association also commended the Rector of DS Adegbenro ICT Polytechnic Itori, Ogun State, Prof Alfred Fatade for the reversal of proposed increment in tuition fee and averting crisis in the school. “We commend the governor of Ogun in his effort to make quality education affordable for the poor, part of which he demonstrated by rejecting hike in tuition fee for state-owned institutions,” the statement observed.
