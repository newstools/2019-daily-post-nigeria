The University of Lagos has set up a task force to address issues of sexual harassment with a view to stemming the ugly tide. NAN reports that the university’s Principal Assistant Registrar for Communication, Mrs Taiwo Oloyede, in a statement said that the move “is in continuation of the institution’s unrelenting campaign against the menace of sexual harassment and other forms of inappropriate behaviours.” DAILY POST had reported that institution recently suspended two senior lecturers exposed in alleged sexual harassment in a BBC investigative documentary video, ‘African Eye’. The documentary also exposed some lecturers of the University of Ghana, Legon. The statement read in part, “The task force has the mandate to examine the extant University of Lagos policy on sexual harassment, receive complaints from faculties, departments and other units concerning matters that border on sexual harassment. “It is to also receive oral and written testimonies from staff and students involved in cases of sexual harassment and recommend appropriate sanction for offenders. “The task force, in addition to other functions, will put forward counselling and other therapies for mitigating the adverse effects of sexual harassment on victims and carry out other duties aimed at eradicating the ugly trend from the institution.’’ Oloyede reiterated the institution’s commitment to stamping out the menace of sexual harassment and related offences from its campuses. She noted that the university “would spare no effort in ensuring that it remained a foremost citadel of learning and promoting excellence in character.’’ Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
