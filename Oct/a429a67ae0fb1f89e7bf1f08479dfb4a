Former Super Eagles goalkeeper, Dosu Joseph, has spoken about Nigerian striker, Tammy Abraham’s England call-up this week. DAILY POST reports that Abraham and fellow Chelsea teammate, Tomori, who are eligible to feature for Nigeria, have been invited by England manager, Gareth Southgate for Euro 2020 qualifiers against Czech Republic and Bulgaria later this month.  If they accept the invitation and eventually feature in any of the matches, they will not be able to represent the Super Eagles again. But Joseph is now saying that the Super Eagles have an array of players they could count on despite losing Abraham to England. “I see no reason why we should be dwelling on Tammy Abraham’s choice of playing for the Three Lions of England. Besides, it is a thing of the heart and where you think you want to represent regardless of what people say,” Dosu told Soccernet. “Now that he has been called up by the England national team, I don’t think there is any need for us to start weeping over it. Yes, he’s a good striker based on his goal-scoring with Chelsea this season. However, of what importance will it be if you beg a player to play for you and he turns his back on you. “As far as I am concerned, I think we have players such as Victor Osimhen, Henry Onyekuru, Paul Onuachi, David Okereke to mention a few, that are scoring goals in Europe. Osimhen most especially must be commended for his goal-scoring exploits since moving to Lille in the French League. “We need to encourage these strikers and not weigh them down with so much attention on Tammy Abraham.” Meanwhile, Abraham has since expressed excitement at his England call-up. “Always proud to get the @Englandcallup. Congrats boys,” the 22-year-old tweeted alongside with a picture of himself with Timori, Mason Mount and Ross Barkley.
