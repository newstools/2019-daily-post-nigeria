Security personnel have arrested seven suspected kidnappers who have been terrorizing communities in Akoko North West Local Government area of Ondo State. Among the apprehended suspects is the son of a prominent Chief in Ajowa community, identified as Wasiu Mohammed. It was gathered that Mohammed, the alleged leader of the group and other members of the kidnap syndicate who were nabbed at the weekend with the combined efforts of security agencies in the state and local hunters, have been terrorizing the people of Ajowa, Akunnu, and Auga, as well as motorists transiting through the communities. According to a source in the local government, the kidnappers met their waterloo after abducting a 45-year-old teacher and Muslim Cleric, Alhaji Jamiu Zakariyahu at gunpoint last week Wednesday at about 8 pm. Zakariyahu was said to have escaped from the den of his abductors when they slept off in the bush. He encountered some local hunters who he met while fleeing from his captors. His escape from the abductors led to the arrest of Mohammed and members of his gang. Confirming the arrest, the Police Area Commander in Ikare-Akoko, Rasak Rauf, disclosed that the suspects had been transferred to the state headquarters of the Nigerian Police in Akure, the state capital.
