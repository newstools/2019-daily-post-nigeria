Referee chiefs have explained why Marcus Rashford’s goal in Manchester United’s 1-1 draw against Liverpool was not disallowed by VAR despite a challenge on Divock Origi in the build-up. Reds manager, Jurgen Klopp was angered by the official decision to allow Rashford’s opener in the 1-1 draw at Old Trafford after it appeared Victor Lindelof had fouled Origi in the United half. Liverpool players called for the goal to be ruled out, but referee Martin Atkinson was close to the incident and VAR backed his decision not to blow for a foul. And now the Professional Game Match Officials Limited, PGMOL, has explained why the goal was not overturned. “Firstly, the on-field referee didn’t think it was a foul and VAR checked/decided that it wasn’t a clear and obvious error to not award the foul,” the PGMOL told Sky Sports “Secondly, VAR isn’t re-refereeing matches – there is contact but VAR was comfortable it wasn’t enough to disallow the goal.” Liverpool got their equaliser in the game, through substitute, Adam Lallana five minutes from time.
