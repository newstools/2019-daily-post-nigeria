Jose Mourinho is interested in returning to the Premier League, so he can become the first manager to win titles at three different English clubs, according to the UK Sun. Mourinho, who was sacked at Manchester United in December 2018, has been recently linked with Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur. Tottenham have lost four of their ten league fixtures to slip to 11th in the table and suffered an embarrassing defeat to League One side Colchester United in the Carabao Cup. Unai Emery is also under huge pressure at the Emirates, with Arsenal winning just one of their last four league games and showing little signs of improvements since Arsene Wenger’s departure. Mourinho won the Europa League and EFL Cup during his turbulent spell at Old Trafford, but failed to replicate the success he enjoyed at Chelsea. Over two stints at Chelsea, Mourinho bagged three Premier League titles, the FA Cup and three EFL Cups.
