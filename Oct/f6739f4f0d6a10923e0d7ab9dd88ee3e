He said: “Senator Akinfenwa left his Osun home on Monday, but only complained of having malaria symptoms on his way, and as he arrived in Ibadan, he went to his doctor, who asked him to rest after medication.” “To us, his complaint wasn’t seen as anything serious as he was not used to falling sick, once he treats malaria, he gets back on his feet. “But, sadly, while he was observing his bed rest at home, and we expected him to be back, he died in his home, on Thursday.” Fakunle, also a former national publicity secretary of AD, described Akinfenwa as “a great leader, who lived an exemplary life as a father and politician.” “He was a founding member of Alliance for Democracy (AD), he joined no other political party being a committed follower of Chief Obafemi Awolowo, he was a principled man and remained so till his death. His kind of leader is rare, we will surely miss him,” he said. Akinfenwa was, in 1999, elected a Senator representing Osun East constituency of Osun State, on the Alliance for Democracy (AD) platform, and became the minority leader in the Senate.
