Brazil assistant coach, Cleber Xavier, has said they will use their upcoming friendlies, to test new players and work on their tactics. Before playing Nigeria, the South Americans will first clash with Senegal on Thursday. Xavier feels the two West African teams, will provide Selecao the challenge they need to prepare for the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign “Nigeria defend less than Senegal. The Senegalese are more about positioning with [Idrissa] Gueye marking strongly. “These two friendlies and the two November friendlies will allow us to test new players and to adjust and tweak some tactical details in attack and defence. “We did this in the preparation for the Copa America. We succeeded in the objective of winning and did so unbeaten,” Xavier told BBC Sport.
