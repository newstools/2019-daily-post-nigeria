The President of Nigeria Medical Association (NMA), Dr Adedayo Faduyile, on Tuesday lamented the kidnapping of medical doctors in the country. Faduyile said about 48 members of the association had been kidnapped in the last two years. The NMA president, who spoke at a news conference to mark 2019 Physicians’ Week in Akure, said doctors in the country have been facing challenges like kidnapping in the line of duty, incessant harassment/assault by patients and their relations, unfortunate maltreatment by employers with poor salaries. He added these challenges have contributed to doctors leaving the country. “The Nigerian doctors decided to celebrate this year with the theme based on the identified lacuna in the care of this category of patients, especially in respect of policy framework. “In the last one year, Nigerian doctors have had significant input in the improvement of the health of the nation. “In this regard, I appreciate all physicians who have been working assiduously in ensuring that we collectively fulfill our key responsibilities to the Nigerian state. “It is worthy of note that all have not been well with Nigerian doctors; the kidnapping of our members in the course of discharging their duties to the Nigerian state with some still in captivity. “Despite the various challenges, Nigerian physicians have continued to render desirable health care services, and we thank God for another year. “I want to state that it is important to continue to strive to improve ourselves for the betterment of the Nigerian populace,” he said.
