Hawk-Eye Innovations, the company supplying Video Assistant Referee (VAR) technology in the Premier League has apologised following a graphic error during Tottenham’s 1-1 draw with Watford on Saturday. Midfielder Dele Alli salvaged a point for Tottenham four minutes from time, cancelling out Abdoulaye Doucoure’s opener for Watford. However, the match official, Christopher Kavanagh, initiated a VAR check for a suspected handball. Kavanagh signalled for a goal after the checks, but an error from the base at Stockley Park triggered a message of ‘No Goal’ on the big screen. The situation caused confusion among Tottenham and Watford fans and the company has now vowed to work alongside the Premier League to ensure there is no repeat scenario. “Hawk-Eye apologises to Spurs and Watford fans for the confusion caused when an incorrect graphic was sent to the big screen,” a company statement posted on its official website, read. “We are working together with PGMOL and the Premier League to understand the root cause of this problem and propose measures to ensure it won’t happen again.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
