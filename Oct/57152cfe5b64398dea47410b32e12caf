Barcelona are monitoring Victor Osimhen at Lille, with a view to making a move when the January window opens, AS reports. The LaLiga champions are looking to sign a long-term replacement for Luis Suarez, who turns 33 next year. Barcelona’s main target is Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez, but they are aware he’s also attracting interest from rivals Real Madrid. Their plan B is to move for either Donyell Malen, Rafael Leao or Osimhen if they fail to land Martinez. The Blaugrana are in the market for a striker between 20 and 26 years old, who could lead their attack for several years. Signed from Sporting Charleroi in August, Osimhen has been a revelation in the Ligue 1 this season, scoring 8 goals in 11 official matches and has set up two goals. The Super Eagles star is under contract with Lille until the end of the 2023/2024 season.
