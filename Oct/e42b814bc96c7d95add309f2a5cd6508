The Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) has warned Nigerians to beware of scammers as it is not recruiting. In a statement by the Head of Corporate Communications, Ibrahim Sani Shawai, the company warned the general public against such fraudsters. “We wish to categorically state that such persons are doing the act at their own peril and KEDCO which is a law abiding organization will go all out to ensure that such persons are brought to face the wrath of the law. “Recruitment exercises in KEDCO as it has been the case has not and will never be shrouded in secrecy. As a major power distributing company in the country, we must advertise our recruitment exercise in well known available media and not this mushroom propaganda that these fraudsters are looking to deceive the good people of Nigeria. “Therefore, we are appealing to the general public to report anyone connected with such falsehoods to the Nigeria Police or to the management of KEDCO, to protect Nigerians from falling prey to the antics of these scammers and fraudsters. “The MD/CEO Dr. Jamil Isyaku Gwamna expressed concerns over the use of propaganda to perpetuate crimes and bring bad names to the good people of Nigerians. “ This is a serious matter and we won’t take it lightly. We will alert the police and other security agencies for proper actions in that regard. We cannot allow our good name to be dragged into such propaganda. “ I am using this medium to call on the Nigerian youths to desist from whatever will not portray the country in good light. We are better than this and we must learn to do things the right way. “There is dignity in labour especially when done in sincerity of purpose but to shortchange the people is an economic sabotage.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
