Super Eagles head coach Gernot Rohr has pushed for Confederation of Africa Football, CAF, to postpone the 2021 Cup of Nations qualifier between Nigeria and Benin Republic, earlier scheduled for November 13. Speaking to journalists on Saturday, Rohr accused CAF of not showing enough respect to Nigeria, a three-time AFCON winner. According to him, it was disrespectful for the continental football body to fix the game between the two West African neighbours only two days after the International window opens. He said; “Our game against Benin is on November 13th, which is a Wednesday. The FIFA window opens on Monday. When will our players arrive and prepare for this game? It’s ridiculous. We need to be respected and I have spoken to CAF’s Anthony Baffoe about it. “I have also spoken to Michel Dussuyer, the Benin coach, as well. We need this date to be changed, so that the teams can arrive and train properly, for this game. Match scheduling must be done properly.” Nigeria will play two AFCON qualifying matches next month, against Benin Republic and Lesotho.
