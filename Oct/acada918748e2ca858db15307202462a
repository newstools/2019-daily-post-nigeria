Brazil forward, Neymar, will be out for four weeks with a hamstring injury, sustained in the international friendly against Nigeria at the National Stadium in Singapore on Sunday. Neymar limped off after 12 minutes and was replaced by Phillipe Coutinho. His club, Paris Saint-Germain, on Monday confirmed the 27-year-old sustained “a grade two lesion” in his left hamstring, after undergoing an MRI scan on Monday. An assessment will be carried out in eight days’ time, but he is expected to miss around a month of action. If he is out until November 11, Neymar will miss four French league matches, including a trip to Marseille on October 17. Neymar will also sit out home and away Champions League games against Club Brugge.
