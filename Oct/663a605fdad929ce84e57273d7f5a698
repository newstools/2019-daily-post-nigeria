According to an insider, the INEC officials suspected to be the brains behind the saga, who were earlier arrested by the EFCC operatives were brought back. The source added that after the search, they were taken back by the EFCC, along with the monies and documents recovered. The decision of the EFCC to arrest about four INEC officials was due to a petition written by one Abdullahi Nasiru on behalf of all presiding officers that worked for INEC during the 2019 general elections in Zamfara State.
