Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State has said any person elected as governor of a state has no justification to steal public funds. Sule stated this during the closing ceremony of the 23rd National Quranic Recitation Competition organised by the Jamaatul Izalatul Bid’ah Wa Ikamatus Sunnah (JIBWIS) on Saturday in Lafia, NAN reports. According to him, any person elected as governor and is found to be stealing public funds, required God’s deliverance. He said governors were well provided for in the scheme of things, and as such, only a diabolic governor would resort to stealing public funds. “When I assumed office as governor, I realised that only those who have no true knowledge about God could steal or that their major preoccupation is to steal public funds. “Any person who is a governor and is stealing public funds , then such a person is in need of God’s deliverance,” he said. The governor called on scholars and other educated elite to join politics in order to help to bring sanity to the system. He dismissed insinuations that one must be wealthy before joining politics, stressing that as long as religious scholars kept avoiding politics, then they should be prepared to elect leaders who would betray their trust. He called on Islamic scholars not to relent in telling the people the truth, even at the risk of rejection. Sule also urged them to aspire for political leadership positions.
