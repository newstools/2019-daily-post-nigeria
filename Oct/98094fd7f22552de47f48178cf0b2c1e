Chelsea youngster, Ike Ugbo, has become the latest England prospect to be targeted by Nigeria. The three-time African champions have been running the rule over the 21-year-old, who has impressed during his loan spell at Roda JC this season. Ugbo scored his fifth goal in just eight appearances for the Dutch side at Telstar on Friday night and Nigeria had officials at the game to watch him having stepped up their interest. Striker Ugbo was born in Lewisham, South London and is eligible for the Super Eagles through his parents. He has played for England at under-17 and under-20 level, helping the latter squad win the 2017 Toulon Tournament. Nigeria were dealt a blow last week when Ugbo’s Stamford Bridge teammate, Tammy Abraham, was recalled to the England squad when they were hoping to persuade him to switch allegiance.
