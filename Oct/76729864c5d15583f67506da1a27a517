Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has reacted to his side’s 4-1 victory over Southampton in the Premier League on Sunday. Lampard also hailed the leadership qualities of winger, Willian after his impressive display against Southampton. Goals from Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount, N’Golo Kante and Michy Batshuayi gave Lampard’s men all three points against the host. “I didn’t think we started that well, even though doing so had been something we’d talked about before. The goal came at the right time and after that I felt pretty comfortable. Getting four away from home – we’re scoring – so it’s a nice afternoon,” Lampard told Match of the Day. “Tammy’s [Abraham] performance was great, his all-round performance and his work off the ball. But I must say I thought Willian was immense – he is an example in what he was doing on and off the ball. He’s a leader – not one that shouts – but in how he performs. “Let’s not get carried away, it’s a long season and we feel we might have picked up more points than we’ve actually got. We’ve not been at our absolute best and we can be a lot better. We shouldn’t be sloppy, at 2-0 we should go 3-0. We’re scoring goals, great, but can we tighten up? Yes.” Lampard added: “I liked a lot of the stuff Callum Hudson-Odoi did, there’s competition in those wide areas now. I thought it was a really good performance, really bright stuff, I’m disappointed he didn’t get his goal.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
