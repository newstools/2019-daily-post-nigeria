The Bauchi State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has appealed to its members not to be demoralized by the outcome of the state governorship election petition tribunal’s judgement on Monday that dismissed the party’s petition against the victory of the incumbent Governor Bala Mohammed. State chairman of the party, Uba Nana, made the appeal on Tuesday while addressing newsmen in Bauchi. He urged all party chieftains, members and supporters to remain committed to the success of the party, assuring that they were making consultations on the outcome of the tribunal’s judgement with a view to deciding next line of action. He appreciated their supporters for showing solidarity to the party throughout the court’s proceedings asking them to remain in the party. Recall that the APC and the former governor of the state Mohammed Abubakar filed a petition before the tribunal challenging the declaration of PDP and governor Bala Mohammed as winner of the last election over alleged over voting and other electoral malpractices. But, the tribunal led by its Chairman, Justice Salihu Shuaibu, while delivering verdict on Monday, dismissed the petition, stating that the petitioners failed to prove their case.
