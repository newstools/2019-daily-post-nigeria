Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has ruled out the possibility of Christian Pulisic going out on loan in January and said he is looking at “the big picture”. The 21-year-old joined from Borussia Dortmund in a £58million deal over the summer, but has only played 90 minutes for the Blues on two occasions – against Sheffield United and Grimsby. With Callum Hudson-Odoi returning to fitness to present another obstacle to a first-team spot, there had even been rumours that Pulisic could be sent out on loan. But, when asked about such suggestions during his Friday press conference, Lampard replied simply: “No.” “With Christian, he’s come to us in a big move, let’s make no mistake about it, and then he’s just turned 21 recently, and we’ve got a competitive squad here,” he added. “I said it before the last game, I always have a problem with who to pick. People make my decisions in training or how they’re playing, and at the minute with winning four on the bounce I need the edge of staying in the team and keep performing and everyone is the same.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
