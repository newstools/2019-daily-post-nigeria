Apostle Johnson Suleman of Omega Fire Ministry has reacted to the conflict between the First Lady, Aisha Buhari and the family of President Muhammadu Buhari’s nephew, Mamman Daura. Suleman called on President Muhammadu Buhari to defend his wife and make her his priority. In a tweet, the clergyman wrote: “I am praying for the president’s wife, just read an interview she granted and felt sad. I plead with @MBuhari to stand up for his wife and make her priority..all these cabals around him are there because of what they want..his wife is his constituency..power comes and goes.” Recall that while Aisha Buhari was out of the country, a video had surfaced online showing her being locked out of a room in the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Upon her return, she confirmed the authenticity of the video, saying that the family of Daura had prevented her from accessing a room in the Villa. But Fatima dismissed Aisha’s claim, saying the wife of the President attacked and rained insults on her. Fatima also went ahead to give full details of what transpired between her and the wife of the President that led to the footage.
