Manchester City striker, Sergio Aguero, was on Wednesday morning involved in a road accident in which his Range Rover’s front right wheel was damaged. The Argentina international was unhurt after the accident. Aguero, however, joined the rest of his teammates at the Etihad training ground without needing medical attention. Speaking on the development, Sky Sports presenter, David Gorrido said: “We understand he is unhurt after being involved in a small car collision, we’ve been told that he’s had a bump this morning. “It’s been described as a minor plan, but has reported to the CFA – City Football Academy as well as the rest of the ancestor City squad and we understand he didn’t need to be checked the by medical team.” Aguero will hope to lead Man City to victory when the host Aston Villa on Saturday in the Premier League.
