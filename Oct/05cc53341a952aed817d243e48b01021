Former Brazil defender, Roberto Carlos, has opened up on his time in Real Madrid as a Galactico, alongside his old friend and Ballon D’Or winner, Ronaldo De Lima. The full-back, famed for his rocket of a left foot from dead ball situations, admitted that the players at Santiago Bernabeu may have wielded too much power at the club during his time. Carlos, a World Cup winner, has fond memories of a ‘crazy’ time, especially that spent with a friend (Ronaldo) from their early days back home in Brazil. “I met Ronaldo in 1993 and from that moment we always shared a room,” he told Portuguese television, as quoted by AS. “I’ve slept more times with Ronaldo than my wife! “Today when I’m looking back I think; how is it possible that we got away with so much craziness? “After every game it was private jets left, right and centre. We’d meet at the private terminal at [Madrid airport] Barajas and [David] Beckham would be off god knows where, [Luis] Figo and [Zinedine] Zidane would be off somewhere or other, Ronaldo and me…and we had to train the day after tomorrow. “I used to pray for Saturday fixtures so I could go to the Formula 1 on Sunday. It was private jets all over the place. It was crazy.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
