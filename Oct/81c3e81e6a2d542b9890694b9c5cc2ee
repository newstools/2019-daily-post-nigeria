He said, ”Alagba had lived in the palace for centuries. “The tortoise played host to many monarchs in Ogbomoso in the past. ”Alagba became popular because Oba Oladunni Oyewumi, Soun of ogbomosoland, used his personal resources to cater for her well being. “The tortoise had two staff members of the palace, dedicated to her. “They provide food, health support and other logistics, so as to make sure she gets the best treatment.
