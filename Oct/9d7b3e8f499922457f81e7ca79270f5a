Africa’s premium smartphone brand, Infinix Mobility maintains an amazing record for empowering its target audience through the implementation of diverse CSR initiatives as well as UGC activities and is once again on the move to inspire the people to do more. Following the recent launch of its entertainment-centric smartphone the HOT 8, the brand has set in motion the HOT 8 challenge; a user generated content activity, creating a platform for young individuals to display their unique talent and stand a chance of winning a whopping sum of $1000. Two lucky winners have already emerged from the ongoing challenge, which kicked-off on September 20, 2019 and is up until October 20, 2019. According to the majority that voted on various social media platforms, the skillful rapper @Castlebennet emerged winner for week 1, whilst the young and talented dancer @blessedson_tunmise emerged winner for week 2. With one more week to go, the challenge is still on and you too can be a lucky winner. Do you have a unique talent? Can you Joggle, sing, dance, rap or simply entertain? Make a short video displaying your HOT skills, post on social media with the hashtags #infinixHot8 and #Hot8Challenge and stand a chance to be among the lucky winners. Voting for all entries would take place on Facebook, Instagram and twitter. The entry with the highest aggregate votes would be announced as the winner and duly rewarded.
