Primary school teachers in Adamawa State have complained of not having been promoted for the past thirteen years. The state chairman of the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), Comrade Rodney Nathan, made the complaint to wild acknowledgment by the affected teachers during the World Teachers Day celebration at the Mahmud Ribadu Square, Yola, on Saturday. The NUT chairman also said that for the same period of 13 years, no leave transport grant and annual increment was effected. He said the development had seriously affected the morale of teachers, and education delivery would be endangered if the trend is not halted. He stressed, “We need to be motivated. Not giving teachers their due is a way of driving them out of the profession. Government must avoid omissions that could cause a situation in which some day, pupils will go into their classrooms and not find teachers.” Also, Nathan cautioned the State governor, Ahmadu Fintiri, against relaxing over the implementation of his policy regarding prompt payment of salary. He explained that contrary to the governor’s instruction that salaries should be paid by the 25th of every month, teachers in two local government areas did not get their September salary until the first few days of October. The state Deputy Governor, Chief Crowther Seth, who represented Governor Ahmadu Fintiri at the event, said the government is committed to the welfare of teachers, especially as education is a priority sector for the government. “In line with our campaign promise, education is receiving our priority attention. That is why we have declared free education at the primary and secondary school levels,” the deputy governor said.
