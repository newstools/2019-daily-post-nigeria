Former Bayern Munich and Manchester United midfielder, Owen Hargreaves, has hailed Super Eagles forward, Alex Iwobi’s display in Everton 2-0 win over West Ham on Saturday. The Toffees were in a desperate need for a win after losing their last four games in the Premier League. Everton, however, returned to winning ways on Saturday beating West Ham 2-0 at Goodison Park. Iwobi was preferred ahead Sigurdsson, who dropped to the bench, for the number ten position and the Nigeria international gave a good account of himself in the first half. Speaking to BT Sport, Owen Hargreaves, said, ”Iwobi has been immense in that number ten position, Theo Walcott has really been positive coming inside. ”Just look at the positivity from all the Everton players going forward. ”Fredericks plays him onside, they deserve something from the first half, they were terrific. ”It’s a really good finish from Bernard but it is a bad mistake from the goalkeeper, he should never get beat from the near post.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
