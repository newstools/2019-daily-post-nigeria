Cross River State Property Development and Investment Limited (CROSPIL) has ejected City Codes loans and Savings Bank located at No 1 Bishop Maynagh Avenue, State Housing Estate, Calabar. DAILY POST was informed that the order to eject the bank was in compliance to the order given by the state governor, Prof Ben Ayade that he want to use the land for establishment of fabrication Institute. The Manager of the bank, Mr Clement Ogunuku who lamented the forceful ejection said, the Bank was not given quit notice or a letter to that effect. “We were given verbal order, no quit notice or letter,” he lamented.  Speaking with our reporter in Calabar on Thursday, Mr Ogunuru said “Though, we were tenant to CROSPIL, we built the place and the money was being deducted yearly as rents. Our Landlord is supposed to have giving us quit notice but that was not done. “No letter, no notice, we were hurriedly asked to quit. Our windows were removed by our Landlord and we struggled to rescue the door. We are contemplating to sue our landlord for breach of contract.  “But CROSPIL itself are shivering because they were given seven days to leave the premises too. Though our rents expired this year, our landlord is supposed to have courtesy of writing to us or give us one year quit notice for us to leave, that was not done. The Governor has been there for about three times,” he explained. When contacted, the Managing Director of CROSPIL, Eno Obongha said “as a civil servant, I am to be seen and not heard, the Governor has given me an instruction and I owed him a duty to implement it to the letter”.
