Leicester City are willing to let Kelechi Iheanacho leave in the January transfer window, the UK Guardian reports. The Super Eagles forward has played only 19 minutes of football during 2019/2020. Leicester are planning a clear out in the winter window and will allow Iheanacho, who they bought for £25million, to go out on loan until the end of the season. Since leaving Manchester City, the 23-year-old has struggled at the King Power Stadium. He was dropped for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations and has only managed to appear on the bench three times in the Premier League this campaign. His only appearance came in the Carabao Cup against Championship side Luton Town, where he scored in the 4-0 win.
