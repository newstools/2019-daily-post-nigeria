The Akarigbo and Paramount Ruler of Remoland, Oba Babatunde Ajayi, has charged a popular singer, Azeez Fashola, fondly addressed as Naira Marley, to thread with caution, saying “they are after you.” The monarch spoke with the singer last night when he paid him homage as he arrived Sagamu to perform in the 2019 Sagamu Day festival. DAILY POST recalls that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had preferred an 11-count charge against the musician bordering on conspiracy, possession of counterfeit credit cards and fraud.
