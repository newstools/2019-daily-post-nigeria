Manchester United’s Executive Vice-Chairman, Ed Woodward, has branded suggestions he picks which players to buy as “a myth” and “insulting”. Woodward took over from Chief Executive David Gill in 2013. During that time, United had slipped from Premier League champions to regularly missing out on the Champions League. Some supporters have blamed
Woodward for the club’s underwhelming recruitment record, since Sir Alex Ferguson retired six years ago. But, he has now rejected the claim that he handpicks players to sign. “There is a myth that we have non-football people making football decisions, and I think it’s insulting to the brilliant people who work on the football side in this club. “Many of the senior staff on the football side of the club have been in their roles for over 10 years. Some of our scouts have worked with us for more than 25 years. “We’ve expanded our recruitment department in recent years and we believe this now runs in an efficient and productive way. “Player recommendations and decisions are worked on by this department and by the first team manager and his staff, not by senior management,” Woodward said, according to ESPN.
