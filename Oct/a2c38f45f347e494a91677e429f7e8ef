Festus Keyamo, Minister of Labour and Employment (state), has given an update on the proposed industrial action by the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, over the minimum wage agreement with the Federal Government. Recall that Labour had resorted to the strike option from Oct. 17 if the government failed to reach a consensus with it on Oct. 16 over the consequential adjustments of the minimum wage. Keyamo, who was present at the meeting on Wednesday night, said the organised labour and representatives of the Federal Government were still discussing over the minimum wage. He noted that the union and government will continue their meeting on Thursday to iron out grey areas regarding implementation of new minimum wage. Keyamo, however, urged Nigerians to disregard report that “Labour has reached an agreement of a 20% and 13.5% consequential adjustments for workers on Grade Levels 7- 14 and 15- 17 respectively.” Keyamo on his Twitter page wrote: “Kindly ignore the trending story that the Federal Government has agreed with Labour a 20% and 13.5% consequential adjustments for workers on Grade Levels 7- 14 and 15- 17 respectively. As you can see, we are still discussing this minute. “It’s past 2am and both sides (labour and government) have decided to adjourn the negotiations to continue by 7pm later today, Thursday, October 17th, to iron out some outstanding grey areas.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
