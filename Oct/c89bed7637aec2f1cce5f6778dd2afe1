Some repentant bandits in Zamfara State who have pledged their unflinching support for the State government have returned over 1,500 rustled cows to their rightful owners within the last one month in continuation of the peace initiative introduced by the State government. Speaking to our correspondent on Saturday, the Senior Special Assistant to Governor Bello Matawalle on security, Abubakar Dauran noted that, the ex-bandits willingly returned the animals signifying that they have embraced the peace accord and reconciliation deal that allowed them to come out of their hideouts and interact with the people of the State. Dauran said, “The domestic animals have since been returned to their rightful owners on prove of ownership and after thorough investigations and interrogation by the security agencies.” he said. The security adviser further said four AK 47 rifles were equally surrendered by the bandits’ commander, Hassan Dan Tawaye, a few days ago. Dauran, however, urged the people of the state to go about their legitimate endeavours without fear of being attacked by bandits, pointing out that, the state government and the security operatives were on top of the whole issue. “There were still some Fulani bandits from neighbouring states who come to the state to unleash terror attacks on innocent citizens. We are very much sure that security agencies were working hard to put a stop to the menace,” he said. He called on the people of the state to always be vigilant and security-conscious and report any suspicious character to the security agencies for necessary action. The security Adviser noted that the submission of arms and return of domestic animals to their owners was a clear indication that the peace accord and reconciliation process was fast recording tremendous success in the state.
