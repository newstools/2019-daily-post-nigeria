Here are some reactions gathered by DAILY POST from Twitter: @Msdamilare “Omashola was robbed sha. Even the housemates are shooked. Even Mike can’t believe it.” @Kunlemyk “I’m really not a fan of Omashola but I really do not understand how come Mike won over him. Nawa ooo.” @Hitee “Mike didn’t win any arena night game, don’t come second in any sef. It was always between Seyi and Omashola.” @Sunkanmi_kings “But how did Mike win the fastest time?
