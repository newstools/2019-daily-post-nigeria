Brazilian legend, Rivaldo, has told Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, to have no worries picking Alisson Becker as first choice goalkeeper at Manchester United on Sunday,
Liverpoolecho reports. Alisson is in contention for a start after missing more than two months with a calf injury that forced him to limp out of the Premier League opener at home to Norwich City on August 9. In the Brazilian’s absence, second-choice goalkeeper, Adrian, had helped Liverpool move eight points clear at the top of the table and boast the best defence in the EPL. However, former Barcelona forward Rivaldo, who won the World Cup with Brazil in 2002, is convinced his compatriot can hit the ground running. “Alisson is now fit and is set to get back on the pitch this weekend for Liverpool’s match against Manchester United,” he said, speaking to reporters. “This is his first match in a few months and perhaps it could be a little risky to put him in to play in such a big match, but he is an experienced goalkeeper and he is certainly prepared to show his value if called upon. “Every player loves to play in these kinds of matches. “Of course, it would be better to have him fully match fit having played a few games already, but that’s not the case, however his experience and quality should be enough to mask that lack of sharpness.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
