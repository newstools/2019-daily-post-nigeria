Lyon have failed with a bid to appoint Jose Mourinho as their new manager, RMC reports. Mourinho remains desperate to secure an imminent return to the Premier League. The former Manchester United and Chelsea boss is waiting for the right opportunity to return to club management, after being sacked at Old Trafford last December. Lyon president, Jean-Michel Aulas, contacted Mourinho about the vacant managerial role following the sacking of Sylvinho. However the Portuguese made it clear that his focus is on returning to management in England, where his family currently live. It is understood that Mourinho is reportedly eyeing the Tottenham manager’s job as speculation continues over the future of Mauricio Pochettino.
