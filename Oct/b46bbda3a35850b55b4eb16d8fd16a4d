Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State has advised Senator Elisha Abbo (PDP- Adamawa North) to explore internal party mechanisms to pursue his allegation of manipulation of the recently concluded Peoples Democratic Party primaries for the November Local Government chairmanship election in the state. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Abbo, had in a video which went viral, accused the governor of disqualifying all candidates associated with him from participating in the primaries. However, Fintiri in a statement signed by his Director General, Media and Communications, Mr Solomon Kumangar, on Saturday, urged Abbo and any PDP member with grievances over the primaries and any party matter to express it through the right channels so as not to create friction in the party. The statement reads in part, “His Execellency views the senator’s action as unfortunate and takes exception to the insults, innuendos and attack on his person and office. “However, for now the governor does not intend to join issues with the senator. “Rather, his excellency is in the delicate phase of laying strong bricks for the security, growth, development and prosperity of the people and institutions of Adamawa state and would not want to be distracted. “His excellency hereby calls on distinguish Senator Abbo and indeed all loyal PDP members to explore available intra-party channels to express their grievances in a civilized and democratic manner to engender cohesion and solidarity.” (NAN) Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
