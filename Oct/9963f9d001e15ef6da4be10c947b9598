A yet-to-be identified man was on Sunday morning shot and hospitalized as some Okere-Urhobo youths and their Itsekiri counterparts clashed in Okere Market in Warri South Local Government Area of Delta State. The youths shot sporadically in the area forcing traders and buyers to abandon the market. The youths also looted some of the shops within the area. However, nobody has been reported dead at the time of this report. The Delta State Commissioner of Police, CP Adeyinka Adeleke, confirmed this in a telephone chat with our correspondent. CP Adeyinka said, “It is one person that was shot and hospitalized and not six as being speculated. “Another person was shot and hospitalized yesterday (Saturday). They’re fighting because of the burial of the King.” DAILY POST learnt that trouble started when some of the Okere-Urhobo youths went to Obahor area and the Okere market which is being shared by the two ethnic groups to enforce an order. They had requested every shop owner to lock up in honour of the final rite of passage of the late Orosuen of Okere-Urhobo Kingdom, HRM.(Prof.) Oghenero Paul Oghenero, Idama II yesterday (Saturday). The Okere-Urhobo youths were, however, resisted on the grounds that commercial shops cannot be closed down in their domain, stressing that when the late Olu of Warri, HRM Ogiame Atuwatse II died, nobody was asked to lock up shops in Warri, especially in Okere market. In the process, a serious argument ensued which led to a serious fight with guns and other dangerous weapons.
