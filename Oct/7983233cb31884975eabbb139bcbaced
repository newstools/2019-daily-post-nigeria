Head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, has praised Senegal forward, Sadio Mane, for his “heartwarming” performance in a 1-1 draw with Brazil in an international friendly on Thursday. Rohr was impressed with how the Teranga Lions controlled the game defensively but refused to disclose his tactical plans to also stop the attacking forays of the Brazilians when they face the Eagles on Sunday. “We saw a good match in a very modern stadium. “Strong defence from Senegal and the Senegalese team also controlled well the great Brazilian players. And Mané gave a lot of troubles to Brazil,” Rohr told SportingLife. Nigeria take on the Selecao on Sunday, October 13 in another friendly in Singapore.
