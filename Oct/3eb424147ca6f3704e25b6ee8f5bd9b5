Villarreal defender, Alberto Moreno, has claimed his teammate Samuel Chukwueze and Liverpool forward Sadio Mane are quite similar. Chukwueze has established himself as a key player in Javi Calleja’s team, since he made his first-team debut last season. The 20-year-old plays on the right flank for the Yellow Submarine and his qualities on the field have drawn a comparison with Mane, who is one of the key players for Liverpool. Moreno played alongside the Senegalese star during his time at Anfield and he is convinced about the similarities the two players share together. “He’s very good, very good. “It’ll seem like bulls**t, but I’ve been following him since last season. He’s super incisive, fast; you never know where he’s going to go. “He’s strong too, young, and defined. He’s a lot like Sadio Mane. I’ve seen the two in training and they’re very similar. “He has a lot to learn because he’s very young, but he’ll become an even better player than he is [now],” Moreno was quoted as saying by Marca.
