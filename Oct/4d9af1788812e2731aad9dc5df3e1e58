Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has backed Fred to replace Paul Pogba in the team, ahead of Wednesday’s Carabao Cup clash at Chelsea. Fred has started four of United’s last five games and Solskjaer said he believes the Brazil international can soften the blow of losing Pogba. Pogba has been out with an ankle problem, since the 1-1 draw with Arsenal on September 30 and will not be available until December. “Fred will probably take Paul’s position for a while now,” Solskjaer told reporters. “He’s been brilliant for us. “There is no use talking about who is not going to be here for a long, long time, because he is not going to come on the pitch and help us until he is fit. “Paul’s been brilliant and he is a creative midfielder that we need, but then it is up to the others to step up.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
