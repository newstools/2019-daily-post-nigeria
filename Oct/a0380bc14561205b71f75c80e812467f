Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom on Sunday commended Taraba State Governor,
Darius Ishaku, for the steps he has taken to end the crisis between Jukun and Tiv of that state. Ortom, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, on Sunday said the decision to set up a committee comprising of Jukun and Tiv representatives will deepen dialogue and prevent further conflicts in the affected areas. He, therefore, called on the Taraba State Government to sustain the efforts, as no meaningful development can take place in an atmosphere of violence. Ortom urged the warring groups to embrace the initiative of the Taraba State Governor and allow peace to return. He added that as Taraba’s neighbour which also feels the negative impact of the crisis, Benue is optimistic that the measures being taken will lay the roadmap to lasting peace.
