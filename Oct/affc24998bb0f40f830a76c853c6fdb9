Tottenham Hotspur midfielder, Moussa Sissoko, has urged Mauricio Pochettino’s side to remain united and move forward following their Premier League 3-0 defeat to Brighton on Saturday. Sissoko also apologised to Tottenham fans for their humiliating defeat to Brighton and also for their 7-2 bashing in the hands of Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday. A goal from Neal Maupay and a brace from Aaron Connolly ensure Brighton defeated Spurs at Falmer Stadium. “We are currently in a difficult period and no one is happy with this situation,” Sissoko wrote on his official Twitter page on Saturday. “It’s not a lack of desire on our part, neither of the staff nor of the club, quite the contrary! “In sport as in everyday life, some moments are difficult, but we have to accept them, face them and come out bigger and stronger. “We will only succeed in reversing the trend if we all do it together. “I am sorry for the fans not to show the true face of the Spurs and all our qualities in these last games. “But with our desire to turn the page on this difficult period and then your support, it is all together that we will succeed in changing the situation and moving forward again! “Let us remain united and move forward.” Tottenham will now take on Watford in their next Premier League clash on October 19.
