No fewer than 39 armed bandits were on Friday neutralised by soldiers in two different operations in Zamfara State. Capt. Oni Orisan, Operation Hadarin Daji spokesman, who disclosed this to NAN on Saturday, said the operations were carried out in Bakura and Anka axis of the state. According to him, 19 of the bandits were killed in an encounter with the army in the bushes of Anka while the 20 were killed in Bakura. Orisan reiterated that the soldiers would not attack any repentant bandit. He, however, said that those unrepentant ones who carry guns and move around in large numbers would be treated as terrorists. He advised the unrepentant bandits to surrender their arms to constituted authorities and embrace the peace initiative of the state government.
