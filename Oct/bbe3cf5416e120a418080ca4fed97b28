Arsenal youngster, Bukayo Saka, is still not allowed in the first team dressing room at the London Colney training ground, despite his rapid rise this season, according to the UK Mirror. The dressing rooms are split into first team and an academy wing and the youngsters have to wait until they are invited, to be with the big boys. It is a long standing tradition at the club, that the players have to win their place. Arsenal have designed it this way, to keep the youngsters grounded and their feet on the floor. Saka has started the last three Premier League games and is also set to sign a new long term deal, which would also elevate his status. The 18-year-old has scored once so far this season.
