Josh Eppiah found the back of the net, as Leicester City thrashed Southampton 3-0 in a Premier League 2 clash, at Holmes Park on Friday evening. The Nigerian striker was making his return from a long-term injury, that saw him miss the whole of the 2018/2019 season. The game against the Saints was his fifth appearance this season. Leicester took the lead, thanks to goals from Thakgalo Leshabela and Callum Wright, before Eppiah came off the bench as replacement for Muskwe on 62 minutes. Eppiah then added one more in the 88th minute, with a fine solo effort. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
