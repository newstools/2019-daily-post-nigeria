Head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, has said the scheduling of their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers next month, is “not ideal and proper”, SportingLife reports. Nigeria open their Group L campaign against neighbours Benin at home on November 13, before travelling to face Lesotho four days later. “Our players from Europe will only get to us a day or two before the first game, so there is no time for adaptation to the African conditions,” Rohr said. “After that game on Thursday we travel to Lesotho away on Friday to play on an artificial surface on Sunday. This is not ideal and proper for any team. “We’ve spoken to CAF about this but nothing has been done.” Rohr has already named a 23-man squad for the two matches.
