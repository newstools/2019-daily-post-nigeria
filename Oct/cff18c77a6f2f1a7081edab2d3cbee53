Barcelona forward, Antoine Griezmann has disclosed that he needs to understand fellow teammates, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez ‘even better’ following his side’s 3-0 victory over Eibar in the La Liga on Saturday. Goals from Griezmann, Messi and Suarez gave Ernesto Valverde’s men all three points against Eibar. Griezmann, who played a key role in both Messi and Suarez’s goals in the second half of the encounter, also admitted that there will be good and bad days for Barcelona. “Of course, there will be good days and bad,” the France international was quoted by Marca as saying after the match. “But today was a good performance and I am pleased. “I am still adjusting to playing here, and that will take time. “We [Messi, Suarez and I] need to understand each other even better, but that will come with minutes and matches.” Barcelona will now take on Valladolid in their next La Liga fixture at Camp Nou.
