Seven persons have been allegedly killed in a renewed cult war in the once peaceful Okundi village in Boki Local Government Area in the Central Senatorial District of Cross River State. DAILY POST gathered that the twelve villages that make up the Old Osokom Clan in Boki Local Government Area had held a meeting seeking ways to eradicate cult activities in the community. The meeting according to our finding was to checkmate activities of the suspected cultists when it was obvious that they were about to strike. But information filtered to the cult groups that the community was plotting to counter their activities, hence they decided to strike first, our source who pleaded anonymity said. “The suspected cultists allegedly camped in the Apostolic Church in Okundi, close to Boki Boys’ Secondary School and at night, struck, killing their first victim, Joseph Bukie Bankong. Late Bankong, according to our source, vehemently condemned the activity of suspected cultists in the community. Joseph Bukie Bankong was killed on Monday while others were killed on Tuesday. Our source further said that the entire community then rose attacking all alleged cult members killing one Alphonsus Etta Ewung, Otu Agbor Edum and Chief Paulinus Otu’s son amongst others. Several houses and property worth millions of naira have been destroyed between Monday and Tuesday when the trouble started. In a telephone conversation, the state police commissioner, Austine Agbonlahor confirmed to newsmen the cult war. However, he said that the police have been mobilized to the area to maintain peace.
