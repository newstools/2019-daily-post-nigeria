Manchester United have reached a verbal agreement to sign Juventus striker, Mario Mandzukic, in the January transfer window, Tuttosport reports. United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, allowed both Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez join Inter Milan in the summer, but failed to bring in a new striker. Solskjaer has now indicated that United’s priority in the January transfer window, is to bolster his attacking options with a new forward. Mandzukic was reportedly close to joining United in the summer, as part of the deal which would also have seen Paulo Dybala make the move to Old Trafford. But he ended up staying with Juve. The Croatia international has not featured at all for Juve this season, while Maurizio Sarri left him out of his side’s Champions League squad which means he cannot feature in Europe. However, the Serie A champions will be looking to sell Mandzukic in January and the striker’s entourage already have a verbal agreement in place with United.
