Manchester City coach, Pep Guardiola, has tipped Xavi Hernandez to manage Barcelona and claims that it is “inevitable”. Guardiola made his name at Camp Nou, where he took charge of the first team in 2008 and won a treble in his debut season. Xavi, who spent 17 years at Barca, is one of the many stars that shone under Guardiola. After a glittering playing career, he spent four years playing with Al Sadd, where he has now graduated to head coach. “Sooner or later it will happen,” Guardiola said of the 39-year-old in an interview with Catalunya Radio. “He is still very young, but it will happen. He understands football and has a lot of passion and dedication. He is brave and says things very clearly.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
