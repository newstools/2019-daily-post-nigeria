President Muhammadu Buhari will sign a military technical cooperation deal with President Vladimir Putin of Russia this month for help in crushing Boko Haram militants. According to Reuters, Nigeria’s Ambassador to Russia, Steve Ugbah, said this on Friday in Moscow. He said President Buhari is due to meet Putin on the sidelines of a Russia-Africa summit in the Black Sea city of Sochi amid a push by Moscow to expand its influence in Africa. Ugbah said, “We’re sure that with Russian help we’ll manage to crush Boko Haram, given Russia’s experience combating Islamic State in Syria.” He added that Nigeria was interested in purchasing Russian helicopters, planes, tanks and other military equipment. Ugbah said a military technical cooperation deal between Russia and Nigeria had already been drafted and that it only needed to be finalised. “We hope President Buhari can take the talks to their logical end. The agreement will open new possibilities in such areas as the supply of military equipment and training for specialists,” he said.
