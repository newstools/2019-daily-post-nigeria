Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has claimed they may boycott their Carabao Cup quarter-final tie, unless a suitable date can be fixed for the game. The Reds progressed to the last eight of the tournament, after twice coming from two goals down to beat Arsenal on penalties, following a 5-5 draw at the end of 90 minutes at Anfield. With the EFL wanting to schedule the Carabao Cup last-eight matches on the week commencing December 16, Klopp’s men will be unable to participate, as they head to Qatar for their Club World Cup semi-final on December 18. “If they don’t find an appropriate place – and I don’t mean Christmas Day 3am – then we don’t play [the game]. “If they don’t find a proper date and we can’t play the next round, then whoever our opponent is will go through, or Arsenal play. “I think a lot of people from the Premier League were sitting watching on television hoping Arsenal can do it. But I’m sorry,” Klopp told Sky Sports. Liverpool currently have nine days free between their Premier League matches against Sheffield United (January 2) and Tottenham (January 11), but this period is set aside for the third round of the FA Cup.
