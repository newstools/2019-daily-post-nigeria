Arsenal striker, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, could leave the club at the end of the season, if they fail to make the top four, according to the UK Telegraph. The Gunners are currently four points away from the final Champions League qualification spot and have a 100% record in the Europa League. Aubameyang has been an integral part of the squad since joining from Borussia Dortmund in January 2018, scoring 49 goals in 76 competitive appearances. The North London club have failed to make it to the Champions League for the past three seasons and if the Gabon international has his heart set on playing in Europe’s biggest club competition, he may have to leave at the end of his contract. The 30-year-old has a year left to run on his current deal and is yet to commit to an extension.
