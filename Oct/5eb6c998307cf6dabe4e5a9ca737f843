Lampard addressed the media Friday ahead of Chelsea’s clash with Burnley on Saturday. The Blues travel to Turf Moor Saturday after securing their sixth win in a row in all competitions on Wednesday night when they defeated Ajax in the Champions League. Lampard will be hoping to have Kante and Rudiger back for the game, with both players struggling with injuries over the start of the season. “I don’t know. I just want him [Kante] fit. He might be suffering from the big injury at the end of last season. There is no timeframe. “Rudiger had a bad injury, this is a fall-out of last season, that is the nature of it. We need to remember that, but he is close. “Loftus-Cheek is well out, Rudiger and N’Golo not ready for the weekend. We need to get him right now. Christensen and Barkley are both out as well.” On Chelsea’s clean sheet against Newcastle and Ajax, the Englishman added, “That has been a great fact for us. Newcastle was difficult for us, but we created a lot and kept a clean sheet. “The pleasure from Ajax was probably the most that we had all season. The work ethic was huge. We kept a clean sheet with our desire. There has been lots of attributes which are positive.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
