Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has singled out Lille forward, Loic Remy for praise ahead of both sides’ UEFA Champions League Group H clash on Wednesday night. He also provided the latest injury update on midfielder, N’Golo Kante after the France international missed the Blues’ 2-0 victory over Brighton in the Premier League over the weekend. “Lille may have less experience than us but they are at home,” Lampard was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as telling reporters on Tuesday at his pre-match press conference. “They have great supporters, the team will obviously rely on supporters to put a lot of pressure on us. There will be a lot of pressure. “This is a special competition. Lille have been fighting hard to get into this competition. They have a lot of talent. They move well, can pass and create opportunities. Also have experienced players like Loic Remy, who I have played with before. Regardless we are here to take three points home. “Kante has trained and got through it okay. One that we have to assess. We are positive. It doesn’t relate to the Europa League. “The fallout of that meant he has had a broken pre-season. He has had a few niggles, some bad luck. Everyone is working to getting him fit,” he added.
