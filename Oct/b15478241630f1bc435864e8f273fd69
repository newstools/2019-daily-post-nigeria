The impeached Deputy Governor of Kogi State, Elder Simon Achuba, is currently under house arrest. DAILY POST gathered that, security men in there numbers and fully armed stormed his residence in Lokoja, thus, preventing him from going out or allowing any one to come in. This development, according to sources has caused panic within the former deputy governor’s area. DAILY POST recalls that the Kogi State House of Assembly had impeached the deputy governor on Friday over alleged gross misconduct. Elder Achuba confirmed this on Friday night when he featured on ‘Democracy Today’ which was aired on Africa Independent Television, AIT, and monitored by our correspondent in Lokoja. His words” As I speak to you, I am under house arrest. My security aide has been withdrawn. Currently in my house, security operatives from government house have taken over my residence. Nobody can come in and no body can go out.” However, Achuba described his purported removal as Kogi State Deputy Governor as an exercise in futility and cannot stand. According to him, Nigeria is not a Banana republic, hence the action exhibited by the Kogi State House of Assembly is a rape of democracy and would not stand. Efforts to speak with the Police Public Relations Officer proved abortive as at the time of filing this report.
