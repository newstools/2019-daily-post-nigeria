The draw for the first round of this season’s FA Cup was conducted on Monday night. This is the stage where League One and League Two teams enter the fray. Chichester City and Maldon & Tiptree are the two lowest-ranked sides left in the competition, having made the first round from all the way down in the fourth tier of non-league. That means they have had to win four ties to reach this stage. FULL DRAW:
