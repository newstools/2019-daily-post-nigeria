The Imo West Senator, Rochas Okorocha, has urged the 2019 Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar to accept the ruling of the Supreme Court against him in good fate. Okorocha, who is the immediate past governor of Imo State, said Atiku should “join hands with his brother to move the country forward”. He said the Presidential Petition Tribunal and the Supreme Court only authenticated President Muhammadu Buhari’s victory. In a statement by his Special Adviser on Media, Sam Onwuemeodo, Okorocha insisted that available statistics proved that Buhari won the 2019 presidential election. He, however, saluted Atiku for challenging the outcome of the election to a logical conclusion, adding that his action will help to strengthen the nation’s democracy. The statement reads: “President Buhari won his election looking at the statistics of that poll but the Presidential Tribunal and the Supreme Court only authenticated the victory. “But what Atiku did was also good for our democracy, it helps to strengthen our democracy but I urge that he now joins hands with his brother, the President to move the nation forward.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
