Barcelona boss, Ernesto Valverde has hailed captain, Lionel Messi for his record-breaking outing against Slavia Prague in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday. DAILY POST recalls that Messi, on Wednesday night became the first player in the world to score in fifteen consecutive UEFA Champions League seasons following his side’s 2-1 win over Slavia Prague. The Argentine captain also equaled a Champions League record held by Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo and Real Madrid legend, Raul, after scoring against Slavia. Messi’s goal against the Czech Republic side means he has now scored against thirty-three different Champions League opponents, a record he now shared with Ronaldo and Raul. Reacting, Valverde was quoted by Foxsports as telling reporters in his post-match press conference: “He’s the player who can decide any game. Every day we see him he’s even better. “One more record for the incredible Leo. They are easy to say, it seems natural, but it is very difficult to achieve.” Barcelona will now take on Valladolid in their next fixture in the La Liga.
