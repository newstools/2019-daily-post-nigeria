Chelsea legend, Pat Nevin has said he believes that Jorginho is responsible for the excellent form of Frank Lampard’s squad right now. The 27-year-old Italian has turned the opinion round of many Blues supporters this season after a superb start to the 2019/20 campaign. Last year, the Italy international got much backlash from several people for his style of play and the way that Maurizio Sarri used him on the pitch. However, this season, Lampard has given the midfielder more of a license to be more direct with his style, passing forward rather than from side to side like last season. But Nevin admits that he was impressed with Jorginho last season, and that he has taken it to another level during the current campaign. Nevin told Chelsea website, “To be honest I thought Jorginho was fabulous last season as well and didn’t buy into the no-forward-passing problem being his fault or even true. “It was the style of the team and in the end it was successful and as we know, he played more through balls than anyone else in the league bar our own David. “There were even a few occasions when he was booed at the Bridge last season and it really upset me. He is the bravest player you will ever meet because of where and how often he takes the ball. “He also controls games as well as just about anyone on the planet just now. Happily Frank agrees and has let him off the leash to be more positive and take a few chances going forward more quickly. “I agree it is even better now than it was last season for our number five. Everyone else does seem to be seeing his attributes now though and it is a huge relief. “I would have hated to lose him to Juventus or Manchester City because that is the standard of clubs that would have grabbed him in a heartbeat.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
