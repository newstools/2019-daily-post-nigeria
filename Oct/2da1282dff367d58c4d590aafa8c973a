Tolu Ogunlesi, President Muhammadu Buhari’s aide on New Media has reacted to the viral video of University of Lagos (UNILAG) lecturer caught on camera demanding sex from an “seeking admission.” DAILY POST reports that the lecturer, Boniface Igbeneghu, is a former sub-dean of Faculty of Art and head pastor of local Foursquare Gospel Church. His advances were captured in a 13-minute video by BBC Africa by an undercover journalist, Kiki Mordi, who disguised as a 17-year-old admission seeker. Igbeneghu disclosed that there is a place lecturers take female students to have fun – UNILAG Staff Club. “They call the place cold room,” he said. Igbeneghu, at the first meeting was quoted as saying, “Don’t you know you are a beautiful girl? Do you know I am a pastor and I am in my 50s but if I want a girl of 17 years, all I need is a sweet tongue and put some money”? At the second meeting, he prayed with the undercover journalist and later asked: “What age do you start knowing men. Be assured that your mother will not hear.” Ogunlesi, reacting to the recent development, likened this case to that of former OAU lecturer, Akindele and Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo of COZA, who allegedly used ‘Jesus’ name to advance their predatory impulses. On his Twitter page, Ogunlesi wrote: “Richard Akindele, Biodun Fatoyinbo, Boniface Igbenehu. “3 ‘Pastors’, 3 sexual predators. The nexus of religion, sex and power. At least two of them actively using Jesus’ name to advance their predatory impulses. “A depressing window into power relations/powerlessness in Nigeria.” Recall that Busola, wife of Timi Dakolo had recently disclosed details of how Fatoyinbo allegedly raped her when she was young. Fatoyinbo, however, denied the allegation, saying he has never forced himself on any woman in his life.
