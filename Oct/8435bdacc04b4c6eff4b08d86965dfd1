Super Eagles midfielder, Anderson Esiti has hailed forward, Sadio Mane-led Senegal for exposing Brazil’s weakness ahead of Nigeria’s international friendly clash with the Selecao on Sunday in Singapore. According to Esiti, Gernot Rohr’s men will draw inspiration from Senegal’s performance against the five-time World Cup champions in Thursday’s international friendly in Singapore. The Teranga Lions came from a goal down to force Tite’s side to a 1-1 draw. Famara Diedhiou scored a penalty late in the first half, to cancel out Roberto Firmino’s ninth-minute opener at the Singapore National Stadium. “Every game is peculiar, we’re proud of how Senegal played and we also learnt some things about the weakness in the Brazil team,” Esiti told Brila Net. “But we’re not Senegal and we’re going to play our game, double our effort in order to get a different outcome.” Esiti added: “If I’m given the opportunity to play, I’ll give my best as I always do. I will work hard and for the team, our collective desire is for a win. “I’m not God. I have been playing professionally for seven years and my motto is fear no one but respect everyone, and that’s how I want to approach this game. “As a team though, we’ll need to pull our strengths and carry each other out on the pitch, as we work towards that common good.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
