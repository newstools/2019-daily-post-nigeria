Former Manchester United defender, Gary Neville, has revealed the one Liverpool player he loves “to bits” after the Reds played out a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford on Sunday. England international, Adam Lallana scored a late equaliser for Jurgen Klopp’s men to salvage a point after Marcus Rashford had opened the scoring for United in the first half. Neville was discussing Man United boss, Ole Gunner Solskjaer’s attacking options with former Liverpool captain, Graeme Souness in the Sky Sports studio after the derby meeting. The former England defender argued that there is not always a need for a striker to score goals for your team to win games, citing Liverpool’s Roberto Firmino as a prime example. He said, “They [United] will play the way they want to play and sign a striker to suit that style. “Liverpool play with three mobile strikers. Firmino doesn’t score 25 goals every year. “He does an unbelievable job, I love him to bits, but he doesn’t score 25 goals. “We had strikers at Manchester United who didn’t score 25, 30 goals but they did brilliant jobs. “You can still win without a striker that scores 25, 30 goals.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
