Barcelona attacker, Ousmane Dembele, is set to miss the El Clasico after being sent off for telling referee Mateu Lahoz he was “very bad”, during their 4-0 win over Sevilla. The France forward scored the third goal as Barca moved second in LaLiga behind Real Madrid, with Luis Suarez, Arturo Vidal and Lionel Messi also on target at Camp Nou on Sunday. But Dembele’s night ended in disappointment, when he was given his marching order in the final minute, for protesting a red card that had been shown to teammate Ronald Araujo, who was making his debut. Dembele had already been shown a yellow card, when Lahoz branded a straight red to leave him facing a ban of at least two games. “The player Ousmane Dembele was sent off for saying: ‘Very bad. You are very bad,’ to me while gesticulating with his arms from a close distance,” Lahoz wrote in his report. Insulting a match official carries a suspension of at least two games. Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa was banned for eight matches last season, after he was sent off for abusive comments about referee Jesus Gil Manzano’s mother.
