Former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, has reacted to Super Eagles’ 1-1 international friendly draw against Brazil on Sunday. DAILY POST recalls that the Super Eagles took the lead in the 35th minute, after Joe Aribo danced past several Selecao defenders to slide the ball under Ederson. However, with barely five minutes gone after the break, the Brazilians drew level. Real Madrid midfielder, Casemiro, pounced on a defensive mix-up to score for the South Americans. Reacting, Ekweremadu on his Twitter page congratulated the Super Eagles on their performance. He wrote: “Kudos to Super Eagles. A draw against Brazil is a good result. Our defence did a good job. “ I salute Joe Aribo in a special way. Two goals in two Super Eagles matches. Wow! Get fit soon Uzoh. Well done, boys. Let’s keep building.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
