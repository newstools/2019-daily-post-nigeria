Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has finally declared a state of emergency on various dilapidated highways in Lagos. His spokesman, Gboyega Akosile, in a statement Sunday night, noted that Sanwo-Olu ordered the commencement of major construction work on the identified highways considered critical to reduce traffic congestion bringing pain to road users. The Governor said all the eight engineering firms had been given the mandate to immediately mobilise their equipment on sites and commence major construction works on the identified roads. Sanwo-Olu said: “The exercise will begin tomorrow (Monday) with palliative work on the selected roads, which are both on the Island and mainland divisions of the State. “The contractors have been given the mandate to start mobilising their equipment to their respective sites without further delay. “Their activities must first give our people an immediate relief on the affected roads so that there can be free-flow of traffic even during the rehabilitation work.” Sanwo-Olu disclosed that Lagos Public Works Corporation (LPWC) would be carrying out repairs of 116 inner roads across the State.
