Charlie Nicholas has predicted that his former club Arsenal, will prove too strong for Bournemouth on Sunday. He is also backing Newcastle to inflict more misery on Manchester United, according to the UK Metro. The Gunners, currently fourth in the Premier League, face a Bournemouth side, who have not lost a league fixture since August. Unai Emery’s men crushed Standard Liege 4-0 in the Europa League on Thursday, and Nicholas cannot see Arsenal dropping points at home to the Cherries. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s United have endured a dismal start to the season and Nicholas believes things could get even worse for the Red Devils, when they make the trip to St James’ Park. He has also backed defending champions Manchester City to beat Wolves and Southampton to earn a point against Frank Lampard’s young Chelsea charge.
