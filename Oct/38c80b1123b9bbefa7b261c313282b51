The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu has said Igbo Presidency will not end the ongoing Biafra agitation Kanu said this during his second broadcast of the month on Radio Biafra on Monday, October 7, 2019. Kanu maintained that those clamouring for Igbo Presidency in 2023 were wasting their time. The IPOB leader further stated that the: “Igbo presidency is a dream, it’s like second Niger bridge and Ogoni cleanup,” hence will not stop Biafra agitation He said: “The claim that Igbo Presidency will stop Biafrans and others from agitating for Biafra does not hold water. “The idea that the Igbo presidency will end the agitation for Biafra is nonsense. “The Presidency coming to the South East in the year 2023, will not make the lives of those living in the region any better. “ The Northern region of the country, has the presidency but still has beggars, banditry, and camps for Internally Displaced Persons, IDP. “Having the presidency will not make your life better, Igbo presidency is a dream, it’s like second Niger bridge and Ogoni cleanup. “IPOB’s mission to #FreeBiafra from Nigeria is divine and unstoppable.
