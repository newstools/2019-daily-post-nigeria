The labour leaders in Ekiti State have threatened to reject Governor Kayode Fayemi’s readiness to implement the N30,000 minimum wage for workers, if it negates the template set by the national leaderships of the labour centres. The labour leaders, however, appreciated Fayemi for deeming it fit to implement the proposal, but frowned on the unilateral decision taken on the matter, contending that labour could have been carried along as earlier agreed on September 30 at a meeting with the Head of Service, Mr. Ayodeji Ajayi. Thy insisted that whatever Fayemi will implement must comply with the national template increment of 66.6 per cent for Grade Levels 01-06, 29 per cent for GL 07-14 and 24 percent for 15-17. Fayemi, had on Friday pronounced the readiness of his administration to effect the new minimum wage commencing from October during the 2019 edition of the Teachers’ Day Celebration. The labour position was contained in a statement jointly signed by the secretaries of Trade Union Congress , Com. Mohammed Bashman, Nigeria Labour Congress, Com Com Akinyemi Taiwo and Public Service Joint Negotiating Council, Com. Gbenga Olowoyo respectively . They stated that “In line with the national directive of the leaderships of the organised labour, anything short of the above percentage , the organised labour won’t do anything contrary to the Wednesday October 16, 2019 set for the national strike in Nigeria over the insincerity of government to pay the new minimum wage to workers on GL 01-17. “The organised labour is constrained to refer to a meeting of September 30 at the office of the Head of Service, the resolution then was that the state government must ensure due process with the setting up of negotiating team and in fulfilment of outstanding salaries and other emoluments before commencing N30,000 minimum wage, although, the pronouncement made on October 5 had Contravened this resolution.” The labour also expressed hope that Governor Fayemi will defray the N57 billion being outstanding workers’ salaries, allowances and pension before clocking one year in office on October 16. “The liquidation of these outstanding payments are sacrosanct. “They include three months payment to public servants, September 2017 and May 2018 deductions, six months arrears of salaries to local government workers, financial backing for 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 workers’ promotions and leave bonuses for 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 to civil servants. “For the avoidance of doubt, the non payment of these aforementioned outstandings before the promised date May threaten the industrial peace in our dear state”, they said.
