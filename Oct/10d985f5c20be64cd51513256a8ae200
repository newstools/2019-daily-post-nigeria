The Ondo State Government has explained that the absence of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu from the state for nearly a month is in pursuance of state-related matters in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. The state Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr Donald Ojogo, explained this in a statement on Thursday in Akure. Governor Akeredolu has not been resident in the southern state for almost a month, with his deputy, Mr Agboola Ajayi, acting as Governor. The development has led to much speculation, with the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, not only querying the Governor’s absence but also alleging that it has affected the running of state affairs. However, Ojogo, in his press statement, described the PDP as weak opposition. He said, “These people (PDP) represent a totality of lies. There is no difference between the rumours they carried about that President Muhammed Buhari was marrying another woman, which never happened and this. “The accumulated state matters in Abuja compelled (Governor Akeredolu) to stay back in the federal capital to enable him settle all pending issues once and for all. This is better than shuttling between Akure and Abuja on a daily basis, which is not economically wise,” he explained. The Commissioner stressed that Governor Akeredolu’s absence has not in any way affected the smooth running of governance in the state. On the controversy over the construction of a fly-over in Ore town, Mr. Ojogo said PDP supporters should go to the Federal Ministry of Works to inquire into the cost of its construction, instead of unwarranted insinuations.
