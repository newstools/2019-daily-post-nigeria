Former England midfielder, Jamie Redknapp, has said it is Liverpool’s Premier League title to lose after Manchester City lost ground on the race following defeat by Wolves. City had the chance to close the gap on the Reds at the top to just five points this Sunday but were beaten 2-0 at the Etihad. Pep Guardiola’s side are now eight points behind Liverpool in the table, with the Reds unbeaten in their opening eight league games. Redknapp is confident that the Reds can finally win a first Premier League title this campaign. “Right now, eight points, it’s Liverpool’s to lose. I believe that. I think because of the circumstances at Man City, the injuries that they have got. “There certainly seems something not quite right there. Liverpool are playing so well, they have just got to keep their heads. “You can imagine it’s fever pitch down there now, they have been there before with Brendan [Rodgers] and then last year believing it was going to be their year. “You know it’s been 30 years, it’s been a long, long time for them. “But I think if they keep their heads, keep Virgil van Dijk, [Mohamed] Salah fit – as long as he’s not too bad – I do believe this is Liverpool’s year.” Manchester United favourite Gary Neville, hoping to pile the pressure on Liverpool, added: “I don’t think they can lose it from here,” Redknapp said on Sky Sports.
