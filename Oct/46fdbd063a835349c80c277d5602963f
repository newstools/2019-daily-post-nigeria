Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State on Friday said he had considered shutting down the crises-stricken Tai Solarin College of Education, Ijagun over the unending controversies surrounding the payment of salaries being owed by the state government. Abiodun, speaking at a government function yesterday in Abeokuta, said “there is high level of lawlessness among lecturers in the college of education.” The Governor confessed that he got tired of the crises in the institution after making several efforts to resolve it. Abiodun, who once admitted arresting some staff of the institution, insisted that, “some of the lecturers are displaying to be lawless in their agitation by allegedly instigating the students against the school management.” He said, “TASCE issue is a different thing entirely. I have tried all efforts to ensure I resolve the crisis, but it seems the some of the lecturers are trying to show they are lawless “After the recommendation of the committee we set up, we have tried to pay some months of salaries and also give fund to the school, but some of the lecturers are still instigating students against the management. “I have never seen where lecturers are not ready to teach even when the students are willing to learn. “I have considered shutting TASCE down over the unresolved crisis.” The governor, however, warned the lecturers not to take his humble position on the crisis for granted, saying, “Ogun State will not take it easy with anybody that want to display lawless attitude in our dear State.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
