Parents of the kidnapped six students and two staff of Engravers College, Kakau Daji in Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State, have denied the state government’s involvement in efforts made to ensure the release of the students and the staff of the school. Recall that gunmen had abducted six female students and two staff of Engravers College, Kakau Daji, in Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State on October 3, 2019. However, the Commissioner of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, had during a visit to the school, claimed he spoke to parents and staff of the school and assured that every effort will be exerted to free the abductees and punish this brazen crime, adding that the school management and the parents of the students will be given updates appropriately. Meanwhile, briefing newsmen in Kaduna on the development, the spokesman of the affected parents, Chukwuemeka Paul Adindu, denied any involvement of the state government towards the release of their students and that two staff. The spokesman, who spoke in tears said, “As we talk to you, we are left on our own to carry out cross. Since the government pronouncement, nothing has been done to rescue the situation of our children. “We have been going up and down pleading with the kidnappers to see reason with the little effort we have made to release our children to us. “We have been suffering, we have been on our own, the school is a private school not a government-owned school. The state government has not done anything to our plight. “We are, therefore, appealing to the kidnappers to please release the students and two staff of Engravers College to us because we are left at the mercy of the kidnappers.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
