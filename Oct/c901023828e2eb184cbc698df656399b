Former Chelsea and Manchester United manager, Jose Mourinho, has disclosed that he wants a club where he can ‘play to win’. Mourinho, who was sacked at Manchester United in December 2018, has been recently linked with Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur. The Portuguese gaffer is still based in London as he eyes a return to football management after being sacked by Man United almost a year ago. Mourinho has been working as a pundit on Sky Sports since the new season started. But the 56-year-old has now clearly started what he’s looking for in his next club. “The only thing that I know is what I don’t want, and what I don’t want is crystal clear. What I want, the general profile of course, but I can’t say clubs or countries,” Mourinho told The Coaches’ Voice. “I am quite pathological in the sense that I have to play to win, and then if I win or I don’t win that’s my problem, and the players’ and the club and the structure. “But I need a project where the feeling is I play to win. “If someone gives me a wonderful, incredible, amazing, 10-year contract and tells me ‘the objective of the team is to stay in the first part of the table, if you finish seventh or eighth or ninth it is perfect, that’s not for me. “That’s my nature. Of course sometimes I remember what I won before, but it’s not me, so my next is to fight to win.” Mourinho won the Europa League and EFL Cup during his turbulent spell at Old Trafford, but failed to replicate the success he enjoyed at Chelsea. Over two stints at Chelsea, Mourinho bagged three Premier League titles, the FA Cup and three EFL Cups.
