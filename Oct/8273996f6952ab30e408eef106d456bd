Manchester United have reportedly identified ‘baby Mourinho’ Julian Nagelsmann, as pressure grows on current boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
Solskjaer faces sack as United struggles in the Premier League this season.
The Norwegian is feeling the heat as United have managed just two wins from their opening eight matches, sitting 2 points above relegation zone. There are fears he will lose his job at Manchester United if they lose to Liverpool after the international break. Daily Mail reports that ‘baby Mourinho’ Nagelsmann is being eyed by the United hierarchy. They have supposedly earmarked the RB Leipzig manager as one for the future and are keeping tabs on him over in Germany. The 32-year-old is contracted to the Bundesliga side until 2023.
