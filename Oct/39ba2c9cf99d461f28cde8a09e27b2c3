Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, has sacked the Maja Siddin Sarkin Kano, Alhaji Auwalu. The Nation reports that the decision followed the high chief’s participation in the grand reception in honour of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje. The report claims that the Emir Sanusi is furious that Auwalu raised the portrait of the late Emir of Kano, Ado Bayero as Ganduje’s convoy passed through the Emir’s Palace from Kano airport towards Government House last Wednesday. A palace source said: “You know what is happening between the Emir and Governor Ganduje. In fact, members of the Emirate Council were warned against attending any government function which the Emir did not approve of. “The Emir was outraged over the action of Maja Siddin Sarkin Kano, which he considered as acts of disloyalty. This man is a very popular man within the Palace. He arranges the Horse for the Emir and he has stayed in the Palace for over 30 years. “People around here are not happy over his plight. People are angry because they believe he is being treated unjustly. I don’t think it is a sin to join happy residents to celebrate the Tribunal victory and home-coming of Governor Ganduje.” Meanwhile, Auwalu, who is in charge of decorating the Emir’s Horse, was also asked to vacate his residence of over 30 years.
