Edo Governor, Godwin Obaseki, on Thursday said that no amount of blackmail would stop him from demolishing private properties built on government land in the state. Obaseki said there was no political undertone in the decision since he had warned in the past that his administration would not tolerate lawlessness. Obaseki, who spoke on the sidelines at the Annual General Meeting of the Edo/Delta branch of Manufacturing Association of Nigeria, said his administration was not afraid of anybody and would not succumb to blackmail. According to him: “Businesses cannot thrive when there is anarchy and complete disrespect for the law. For us as a government whatever we need to do to ensure that there is law and order will be done. “If you have done the wrong thing and taken over properties that is not yours, to build on government property is the wrong thing to do. If you go and build on road, that is not the right thing to do. If government tolerates that then more people will become lawless. “If any law has been breached in Edo State, I have sworn to the constitution to preserve order. This is a government that is not afraid of anybody and will not be subject to blackmail. Anybody who contravenes the law no matter how highly placed you are in Edo State, you will be dealt with. “It has no political undertone. If you go to Etete now, I am doing the same thing. I am fencing the sports centre. I have warned in the past that anybody who encroached on government land or school properties will be dealt with. Go to Bénin Technical College, that is evidence. As long as they continue to behave lawlessly, we will enforce the law.” ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
