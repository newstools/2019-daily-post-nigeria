President Muhammadu Buhari has come under attack over request for the approval of N10 billion for Kogi State. DAILY POST reported that President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday sought the permission of the Senate to approve over N10bn for Kogi State. In the letter, Buhari said, the amount was expended on projects on behalf of the Federal Government, which he was seeking the refund through promissory notes and bonds. The letter also explained that 23 other states with authorised expenditures on behalf of the Federal Government have been previously refunded, noting that Kogi State would be refunded on prompt approval of the Parliament. Reacting, Reno Omokri, former aide to ex-president Goodluck Jonathan queried the request for approval of funds few weeks to Kogi State governorship election. Omokri on his Twitter page wrote: “Why does General Buhari want to pay Kogi ₦10.9 billion weeks to election? Why is Kogi special? Is it because they have an APC Governor? “Why is he not paying the PDP state of Bayelsa? First Tradermoni, now this? Is this democracy?” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
