The All Progressives Congress (APC) on Sunday condemned the attack on the Benin residence of the party’s National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole by political thugs. It said those behind the incident were ‘desperate persons who have political ambition’. Lanre Issa-Onilu, APC National Publicity Secretary, in a statement, however, commended Oshiomhole for “calling for calm after the apparent attempt on his life”. APC called on the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammad Adamu and other relevant security outfits to investigate the ugly incident and prosecute the sponsors and attackers. “In Edo State, just as in any other state, everyone must be free to go about their normal and legitimate activities without harassment, intimidation, threat to life and property. “It is clear that the sponsors of the attack are bent on causing crisis in the state in pursuit of their desperate and unpopular political interests. Human life is greater that anyone’s political ambition”, he added. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
