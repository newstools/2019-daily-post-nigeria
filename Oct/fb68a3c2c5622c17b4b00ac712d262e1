Arsenal new boy, Kieran Tierney, has opened up on having to adapt to life in England, after moving from Celtic in the summer. After spending his entire youth and professional career in Glasgow, it has been a big change for the left back, since he signed for the Gunners on deadline day. And without his friends and family, Tierney revealed that he has struggled at times to get used to his new life and he doesn’t venture far from his house. “Coming to London has been a huge change for me. “I’m a home boy who has always stayed with my parents and now I’ve come to a new country and a massive city. “I’m living on my own for the first time and it’s not been great. I need to cook every night and I’m still learning how to do that. But I’ll get there. “People back home ask me “what’s London like?” But I have no idea because I’ve never been into the city. “I train, I work hard, I go home to recover and I train the next day. It’s just a simple life and I put everything into football. “Signing for Arsenal was the hardest decision of my life, leaving the club I had been at for 15 years of my life,” Tierney said according to SportsMail.
