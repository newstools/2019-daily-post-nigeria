Some Nigerians have reacted to Super Eagles’ 1-1 international friendly draw against Brazil on Sunday. DAILY POST recalls that the Super Eagles took the lead in the 35th minute, after Joe Aribo danced past several Selecao defenders to slide the ball under Ederson. However, with barely five minutes gone after the break, the Brazilians drew level. Real Madrid midfielder, Casemiro, pounced on a defensive mix-up to score for the South Americans. Here are some comments gathered by DAILY POST from Twitter: @DONJAZZY, “That was a hard-fought draw against five-time world champion, Brazil. Joe Aribo was really impressive in the midfield while Chukwueze, Iwobi and Osimhen led the attack well. I just think Tammy Abraham would have been a good back up to Osimhen in this squad. Good match! #BRANGA.” @egbas, “Decent Super Eagles display overall. I liked how we kept our shape and shut out the Brazilians whenever they attacked. Onuachu’s trial with this team is over. We have a good 2nd choice goalie. Future is bright #BRANGA.” @bayo_atobalo, “Baba Iwobi played nothing today, Chukuweze, Osimhen and Simon played better.” @SK_ENTERPRISE1, “I underline this “Abraham back up for Osihmen” if Osihmen play a good squad, he would perform better than Abraham @Oglegion1, “Fair game. @DavidCullinan26, “I swear, we tried real hard.” @tammyabraham, “nah do him self with. 3 minutes full time wa him Dey play go away.” @Favourtrillions, “I know it’s because of our we anyhow NFF he chose England.. plus Iwobi no follow today abeg.” @kali_Editz, “I wish Abraham all the Best! We’re good just like this. We just need to work harder and stop allowing corruption ruin our Football Association.
