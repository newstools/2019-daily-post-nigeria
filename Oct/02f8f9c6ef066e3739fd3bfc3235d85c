Archbishop Alfred Adewale Martins, Catholic Archbishop of Metropolitan See of Lagos, has warned that persons who take their own lives will go to hell. He noted that suicide was not an answer to problems experienced by individuals in the society. Adewale Martins spoke during the administration of the Sacrament of Confirmation at Saints Joachim and Anne Catholic Church in Ijegun, a suburb of Lagos, on Sunday. “Suicide comes more often today in our society because our young people have lost their faith in God”, NAN quoted him as saying. “Suicide is killing, and God has condemned that in his commandments; anyone who does that means condemnation to hell,” he said. Addressing the 607 candidates at the confirmation sacrament, he urged them to receive the gifts of the Holy Spirit and put them in action wherever they go. “As you receive the Holy Spirit today, your life should reflect love, peace, gentleness, joy and self control. “Let us strive to be perfect Christians, ready to defend the truth; be loyal to God and passionate with your neighbours,” he said. According to him, the Holy Spirit strengthens and burns all forms of evil, but should not be used as an avenger or a messenger for killing or destruction of lives.
