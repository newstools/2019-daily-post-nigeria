Bauchi State Ministry of Education has sacked the Principal of Hasan Usman Katsina Unity College for under-feeding his students. A statement by the Commissioner for Education, Dr Aliyu Tilde, said the sacked Principal along with two storekeepers were found serving the food of 350 students to over 1,200 students last weekend in spite of the state government supplying sufficient food items to all its 35 boarding schools before the inception of the school year. A new Principal was appointed by the Ministry on Tuesday for the Unity School, which draws students from all the 19 Northern states. The statement further quoted the commissioner as saying that a robust high-tech arrangement for monitoring of student meals along with designated resident food police will soon be deployed to all boarding secondary schools in the state. “The era of starving boarding students will become history in the state in the next few weeks, in sha Allah,” the commissioner said.
