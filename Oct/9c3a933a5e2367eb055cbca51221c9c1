Promising Nigerian winger, Andrew Ijiwole, scored for Manchester City against Liverpool in the U18 Premier League Cup on Saturday. The Huddersfield Town starlet, who is currently on trial at Manchester City and has been training with the Citizens and was involved in their 4-1 rout of Stoke City last Friday. Ijiwole started on the bench in yesterday’s game against the Reds and made an instant impact when he came on in the 83rd minute. The 18-year-old trialist added a fourth goal for Manchester City deep into stoppage time in the 4-0 win over Liverpool. Manager Gareth Taylor is observing Ijiwole at close quarters after he impressed in a friendly against the club whilst playing for Huddersfield Town U17s in 2018. If he is offered a contract, he would join Felix Nmecha, Nathanael Ogbeta, Gavin Bazunu, Fisayo Dele-Bashiru, Timi Sobowale and Samuel Edozie at Manchester City’s Academy.
