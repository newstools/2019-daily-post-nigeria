Real Madrid fought back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Club Brugge on Tuesday to ward off more Champions league humiliation this season. Club Brugge stunned the Santiago Bernabeu in the first half through two goals from Emmanuel Bonaventure Dennis. However, Sergio Ramos and Casemiro clawed back a point for Zinedine Zidane’s side. A 3-0 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain on matchday one had led to some speculation over Zidane’s position as head coach and the nature of their first-half display against Brugge will have done little to ease the pressure. But the Galaticos comeback in the game against Brugge which was secured after Ruud Vormer’s red card, spared Madrid some criticism. It, however, means they are only a point behind Brugge in Group A, who drew with Galatasaray in their opening match.
