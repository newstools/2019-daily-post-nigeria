Arsenal have made a bid for a Real Madrid winger, Lucas Vazquez, ahead of the January transfer window. However, El Desmarque reports that the Gunners face stiff competition from Roma and Bayer Leverkusen. Vazquez’s future seems to be away from the Bernabeu, with Brazilian forwards Rodrygo and Vinicius Jr. set to be given more opportunities in the first-team. Arsenal would see an ideal alternative for Vazquez, who has won three Champions League with Real. The 28-year-old would provide competition in the attacking positions for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette, Nicolas Pepe and promising youngsters Reiss Nelson, Gabriel Martinelli and Bukayo Saka.
