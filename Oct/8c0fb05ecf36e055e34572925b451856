Human rights activist, Deji Adeyanju, has vowed to petition the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, against National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu. He said the petition will be submitted on Friday. Adeyanju, who is the convener, Concerned Nigerians, said this on Thursday in a post on his Facebook wall. The activist said he felt it was wrong of the APC leader to have had two bullion vans at his Bourdillon, Ikoyi, Lagos home on the eve of the presidential and National Assembly elections. Adeyanju, who spent 78 days in custody between last December and March, wrote, “We, Concerned Nigerians, are going to submit a petition to the EFCC on Friday about these bullion vans at Tinubu’s house on [the] eve of presidential elections, then wait to hear what excuse they will give again. “We know they won’t take any action but we will submit the petition.” The EFCC had been under fire on social media for failing to take action against Tinubu who admitted on live television that he, indeed, had money in the bullion vans which he would give to his supporters.
