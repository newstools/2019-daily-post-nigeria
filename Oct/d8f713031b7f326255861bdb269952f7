Tragedy struck on Monday as men of the Nigeria Customs Service allegedly killed three students of Ojumo Community High School, Ihunbo in Ipokia Local Government area of Ogun State, injuring market women. DAILY POST reliably gathered that a vehicle being driven by a Customs officer lost control and killed the students, who just were standing by the road side after close of school for the day. The vehicle, it was learnt, was seized from some suspected smugglers along Idiroko road. It was gathered that the incident happened close to Ihunbo market, thereby bringing injuries upon market women too. Irate youths of the community were said to have set the vehicle on fire as the Customs officers took to their heels for fear of being lynched. The Ogun Customs Public Relations Officer, Aliyu Maiwada, confirmed the incident to DAILY POST. His words: “I can confirm there is an incident that happened and our officers were involved and it’s very unfortunate that life is involved. But we are yet to confirm the details of what happened. “However, the preliminary information is that our men were conveying a ‘tokunbo’ vehicle suspected to have been smuggled into the country; in which an okada rider carrying some students crossed their way. It was an accident. I cannot inform you about how many lives that were lost at the moment.” DAILY POST recalls that a youth group in Ipokia local government on October 1 claimed that about 100 residents of the area have died in the last five years in series of clashes with security agencies over smuggling activities.
