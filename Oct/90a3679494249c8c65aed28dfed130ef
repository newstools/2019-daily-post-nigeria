The candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the February 23 senatorial election in Kogi West, Smart Adeyemi, has boasted he will defeat Senator Dino Melaye of the Peoples Democratic Party, in the fresh election ordered by the Court of Appeal on Friday. Senator Melaye lost his appeal on the grounds that his application challenging the judgment of the Tribunal, could not prove the allegations that he was not given a fair hearing. Adeyemi in a short message, alleged that Melaye had never won any election, owing to manipulations. “Dino has never won any election, it’s all manipulations. But the judiciary has further reinstated our hope and that it’s the last hope of the masses “There’s no basis for comparison between me and Dino, if INEC conducts election again, I will beat him arms down,” he said. Meanwhile, Senator Melaye, had in reaction to the judgment, which sacked him as the lawmaker representing Kogi West senatorial district, said, “Court judgment is human judgment, I believe in the divine I mean God’s judgment.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
