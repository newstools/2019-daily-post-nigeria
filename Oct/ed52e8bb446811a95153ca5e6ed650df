Juventus legend, Gianluigi Buffon, has backed Paris Saint-Germain stars, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe to win the Ballon d’Or in the next few years ahead of Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and Juventus’s Cristiano Ronaldo. Buffon, a former teammate with Neymar and Mbappe during his time at PSG, believes the duo can be the new Messi and Ronaldo by winning the world top individual prize in years to come. “During my season at PSG I had the chance to play with two future Ballon d’Or winners,” the 41-year-old told Eurosport. “I’m talking about Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. These are two extraordinary talents. “They are part of the reason I went to PSG. Kylian has the world in his hands. If he says to himself: ‘I must win the Ballon d’Or five times in ten years,’ he will do it. Everything depends on him.” Buffon added: “Neymar has the technique, talent, and class that I have probably never seen. “I often spoke to him. I said: “it’s incredible, you’re 26 years old and you have not won the Ballon d’Or yet. You should have won it even though there is Messi and Ronaldo. You do not have to wait until they stop because you’re as strong as they are. The next five years, you must win three! Three for you and two for Kylian. You have the ability to do it.’” Both Neymar and Mbappe are expected to feature for PSG this Friday when they tackle Nice in the Ligue 1 fixture.
