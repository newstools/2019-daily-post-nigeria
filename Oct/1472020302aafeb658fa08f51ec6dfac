Chelsea striker, Tammy Abraham, has said he always bidded his time to play for England, as he was only keen on representing the Three Lions. As things stand, the 22-year-old is still eligible to represent Nigeria. However, he will end the uncertainty surrounding his international future, if he features in any of the upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria. Abraham already has two senior England caps to his name, but they were collected during friendly outings against Germany and Spain in November 2017. He told the Evening Standard: “Back then in 2017, it was all about me being young. “It was a good experience, for me. So, to be going back now, I had my experiences out on loan, I’m back and now it’s time to stay here. “For me, it’s a massive achievement [to be in the squad]. I’m clearly doing something right for my club to get attention from Gareth Southgate. It’s about going out there, helping the team as much as possible. And then coming back in and doing the same job for my team.” Abraham also insisted the Nigeria issue has not been raised, during his time in the England camp. He added: “I’m a player growing up in England, playing in the Premier League. My ambitions were always to play for England. Obviously it’s nice to be wanted by two nations, two nations that I love. But my main focus is England.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
