Brazilian legend, Rivaldo has urged the Paris Saint-German frontman, Kylian Mbappe to secure a transfer away from Ligue 1 in order to fulfil his potentials in football and follow in the footsteps of multiple Ballon d’Or winners Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. 20-year-old Mbappe, who joined French champions PSG in 2017, has already won the World Cup with France in 2018, and six major trophies at club level, including three Ligue 1 titles. A number of pundits have tipped Mbappe to pick up the mantle as the best player in the world when Juventus forward Ronaldo and Barcelona talisman Messi finally hang up their boots. However, Rivaldo feels the PSG superstar must first seal a move to either Spain or England to achieve that feat. According to him, the ‘competitive level’ in France does not measure up to the same high standards as in the Premier League or La Liga. Speaking with Betfair, the ex-Brazil international said: “There’s no doubt Mbappe has the qualities to become one of the best in the world, as he is playing great football and has huge potential. “He would be able to develop his talent by playing in La Liga or the Premier League. “Ligue 1 is clearly below the competitive level of Spain or England. With all due respect to PSG, I believe he must leave for a Spanish or big English team in the future to confirm himself as the heir to Messi or Ronaldo. The best players need to play in the best leagues. “But I think it would be tough for Barcelona to sign him in the future, as he is very expensive due to his young age, world champion status and natural ability that makes him one of the biggest prospects in the world of football. “If Barca had so many problems in trying to sign Neymar, just imagine how much PSG would be asking for the Frenchman, so it’s almost impossible to bring this excellent player to Catalonia at the moment.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
