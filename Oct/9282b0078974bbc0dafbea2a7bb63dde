Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has agreed with Olivier Giroud’s comments that he “doesn’t accept a bench role” in his squad. But Lampard is aiming to convince the striker to stay at Stamford Bridge for the duration of the season. Giroud recently expressed frustration while on international duty for France at his lack of minutes for Chelsea this season and said that he “will make a decision in January” over his future. “No, [we want him to stay] because at the minute, he is a big part of the squad. As I say, Tammy has been producing but I would sit down with him (Giroud) because I respect him. But no, I want him here. “I have had a good chat with Oli before he went away. I always respect all the players, particularly of his age. I was in that sort of low-30s age. I love his professionalism. He was bang on when he spoke to me. He was bang on with his quotes when he was away with France. “He shouldn’t be happy and accept not playing. That’s what good players do. As I said to Oli, he will get his games and be a big influence for us. At the moment, because of how Tammy is playing at the moment, there haven’t been as many minutes. “So, that will be something I will sit down happily with Oli in January but January is quite a long way away,” Lampard told reporters at Stamford Bridge.
