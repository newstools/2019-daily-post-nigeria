Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate Mercy has finally broken silence on eviction of her fellow housemate, Diane. Mercy on Monday saw her closest friend in BBNaija house, Diane evicted from the reality show. She broke down in uncontrollably tears as she blamed herself for the eviction. However, finally speaking to Biggie during her Thursday night diary session, Mercy said she broke down in tears when Diane was evicted because they had a lot of plans for the 99th and final day. She also added that she felt Diane and Ike’s eviction was as a result of her destiny to always lose those that she loves and that it made her sad. “I did not like the way she left and it was immediately after Ike. “I kept saying to myself is it my destiny to lose people I love around me. “I was just asking myself a lot of questions like if I’m destined not to have love around me. “But I know wherever she is she would want me to be strong. “It hurts me so much that someone we planned to slay together on Sunday left just like that. I would have wanted six of us to be evicted,” Mercy told Biggie. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
