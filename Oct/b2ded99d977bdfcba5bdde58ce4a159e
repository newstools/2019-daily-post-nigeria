Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, has made it clear he wants to win the Treble with the Italian club this season. Speaking to the media ahead of their Champions League clash against Lokomotiv Moscow, Ronaldo said he was eager to win the Serie A, the Italian Cup and the Champions League. “We want to win Serie A, we want to win the Cup, the Champions League,” he said. “Juventus should think big. We are going to try to win all the trophies, we know it will be difficult, especially the league and the Champions League, but I think it is possible. Everything is possible.” Ronaldo further claimed he was not really keen on individual accolades, as collective awards was “the most important thing”. He added: “In terms of individual, I have nothing to say as this is individual. It is not the most important thing. “The most important is the collective awards. If you win the collective awards you have more chance to win the individual awards. The Golden Ball is for me in second place.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
