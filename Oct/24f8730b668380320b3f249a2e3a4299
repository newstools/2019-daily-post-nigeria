Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo could be banned from travelling to the UK after Brexit, reports The Daily Mail. Messi and Ronaldo are two footballers who have been convicted of tax fraud in recent years. The report quoted immigration lawyer, Andrew Osborne, as saying: “There are a number of very famous footballers with convictions and suspended sentences for tax evasion. They, thus far, have not had to worry as they have EU passports. “But, post-Brexit, they potentially may not be able to enter the country [as they will be treated like non-EU nationals]. “Anyone with a prison sentence of any sort, the starting point is you are not allowed in.” Though Messi is Argentine by birth, he has dual Argentine-Spanish citizenship and hence could fall foul of the new rules. It is, however, possible that Messi and Ronaldo, could be handed an exemption by the Home Office.
