Biafra Nations Youth League, BNYL, on Tuesday declared that the struggle for Biafra will continue even if the South East produced Nigeria’s next President. BNYL said people of the South East have sacrificed a lot in their push for Biafra, hence the struggle can’t be jettisoned for Presidency. This declaration was made by the group’s Secretary-General, Ordu Jeoffrey Nwosoiba and was contained in a statement forwarded to DAILY POST. He said, “Biafra will continue even if Nigeria decides to allow President of Igbo extraction. The demands for a separate state of Biafra remains sacrosanct. “The people of the region have sacrificed a lot for Biafra that it is no longer possible to drop the agenda for Igbo Presidency, “Though we are not a hindrance to Igbo Presidency, but it should be noted that even after Igbo Presidency Biafra will not die.” Nwosoiba also declared that the group enjoys a large followership especially in the South-south geopolitical zone, adding that all those who were arrested at Bayelsa junction on their way to the inauguration of Biafra National Council, BNC, officiated by Chief Dokubo Asari on 17 august 2019 were all indigenes of Rivers State, Cross River and Akwa Ibom. He lamented that it will be “too difficult for them to adopt Igbo Presidency instead of Biafra which is our right.” Nwosoiba admitted that his people are Igbo speaking but are yet to be fully integrated into Igbo union due to the identity crisis in Rivers State caused by the civil war.
