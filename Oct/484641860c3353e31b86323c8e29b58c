Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, has been ruled out until December. Pogba has struggled with an ankle injury since August and has featured just five times in the Premier League this season. United had hoped the France international, would return for United’s Carabao Cup clash with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. But Red Devils boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has ruled the player out for at least another month. “I don’t think we’ll see Paul maybe before December. He’ll be out for a while. He needs time to fully, fully recover, so I don’t think he’ll be back. “Maybe after the international break – but probably December before you see him. “I’m not the doctor, but there is an injury there that needs healing. It is his ankle rather than his foot,” Solksjaer said after their 3-1 win at Norwich on Sunday.
