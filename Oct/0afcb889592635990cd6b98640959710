Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, has once more fuelled speculation over a possible move to Real Madrid, after meeting with Zinedine Zidane, according to the UK Mirror. The newspaper released pictures of the pair talking in Dubai, where Pogba has been recovering from injury over the international break. Zidane was in the Middle East where he spoke at a conference on the integration of Artificial Intelligence in the sports industry. Pogba was a top target for Zidane over the summer transfer window. But the LaLiga giants failed to sign him, as United were unwilling to sell the 26-year-old. Pogba will miss Sunday’s crucial Premier League clash against Liverpool, as he is not fully fit.
