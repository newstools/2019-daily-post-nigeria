Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has predicted relegation if his players continue to play like they did, in the first half of their 3-0 win over Aston Villa. Second-half goals from Raheem Sterling, David Silva and Ilkay Gundogan saw City ease home. But speaking to the media afterwards, Guardiola was not fully satisfied. “If we play like we did in the second half, we will be there at the end of the season, I am sure of that,” he said. “If we play how we played in the first half, we will be relegated in the relegation positions far away from the top of the table. “We have to play for the 90 minutes. We played just for 45.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
