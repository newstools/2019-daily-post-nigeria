The National Chairman, All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, has accused Gov. Godwin Obaseki of Edo State of creating crisis among members in the party. The National Chairman of the ruling party said Obaseki was planning to dump APC, hence his reason for creating crisis in the state and blackmailing him. Oshiomhole, however, advised Obaseki to focus on delivery of good governance to the people rather than blackmailing his personality. He gave the advice in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Simon Ebegbulem, in Abuja on Tuesday. The APC chairman said: “We have it on good authority that the governor (Obaseki) intends to create disaffection and crisis in the state, APC and probably dump the party for another party. “That is why, he has embarked on this brigandary which Edo people will resist. So, he should stop blackmailing me and face governance which is why Edo people voted him into power. “We are even more scared now that the governor is making every effort to coerce me into giving him details of my movement in Edo State. Who knows what he is plotting again. But every evil plot against me will fail.” He alleged that the last Saturday’s siege at his residence by Obaseki’s thugs was a good example. “Before that incident, state government sponsored thugs have been harassing, intimidating APC members across the 18 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the state because APC leaders refused to adopt his second term aspiration. “People are being sacked in their jobs everyday in the state,” he said.
