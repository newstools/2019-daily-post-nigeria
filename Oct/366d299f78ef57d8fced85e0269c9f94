Nigerian winger, Nathan Butler-Oyedeji on Saturday scored for Arsenal in their 3-2 defeat to Blackburn Rovers in an Under 18 Premier League Cup fixture. Mazeed Ogungbo scored the first goal of the match for Arsenal after 21 minutes but goals from Horlock, Lonsdale and Zimba gave Blackburn Rovers a 3-1 lead. However, Butler-Oyedeji pulled a goal back for the young Gunners in the first minute of second-half stoppage time. Butler-Oyedeji, who has been impressive for Arsenal so far this season, has featured in ten matches for the club. The youngster scored his first goal for the club last weekend in their 2-2 draw against North London rivals, Tottenham Hotspur. He will hope to lead Arsenal to victory when they take on Chelsea in November in their next U18 Premier League Cup fixture.
