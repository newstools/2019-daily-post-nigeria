DAILY POST reported on Wednesday that a commercial Toyota Sienna with passengers, plunged into the Ososa River on the Sagamu-Ijebu-Ode-Benin Expressway in the Odogbolu Local Government Area of Ogun State, barely four days after a staffer of Tai Solarin College of Education (TASCE), Tajudeen Oropo, plunged into same river.  The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and the Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement (TRACE) Corps said they had hired the services of local divers to search for the missing passengers. TRACE Corps spokesperson, Cdr Babatunde Akinbiyi told DAILY POST that efforts of all rescue agencies to locate the 10 passengers had not yielded any result. Akinbiyi, speaking in Abeokuta on Friday, said the search for the victims would continue tomorrow. Meanwhile, the Ogun State government has promised to put an end to similar accidents by installing barriers on each sides of the river.
