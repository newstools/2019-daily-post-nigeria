Wolves boss, Nuno Espirito Santo, has hailed his players and claimed Manchester City are not the same team that dominated the Premier League for the last two seasons. Wolves defeated Pep Guardiola’s Man City 2-0 in their Premier League clash on Sunday afternoon. The result puts Manchester City 8 points behind Liverpool who narrowly defeated Leicester City earlier on Saturday. “I’m very, very proud,” Wolves boss told post match press conference. “It was a very good performance and more than that, it was the work-rate. The players ran and ran. “It’s very difficult to play against City. It requires a lot of high-speed running. “But City are not the same City as they were last season. There are areas to exploit.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
