Former Manchester United and Liverpool striker, Michael Owen, has said Unai Emery’s biggest problem at Arsenal, is the form of Nicolas Pepe. Pepe has endured an underwhelming start to life at the Emirates, following a £72million move from Lille in the summer. The 24-year-old has scored just once in nine appearances for the Gunners and admitted this week that his confidence was low. Pepe was benched for Arsenal’s Europa League clash against Standard Liege on Thursday and failed to make an impact when he was introduced with 24 minutes left. “We’re talking about a lot of positives for Arsenal but there’s one negative niggling away at the moment and that’s Pepe. “I was excited by him, I watched him in the French league, he looked a very good player. He started the season, first game he looks as though he had a bag of tricks. “But he’s just gone off the boil and that’s a huge investment for anybody but it’s a huge investment for Arsenal especially. “I would have liked to have seen him come on and play really well today against an average team, show his stuff and get a bit of confidence, because that’s a concern I think,” Owen told BT Sport.
