No fewer than 228 prisoners have reportedly escaped from the Medium Federal Correctional Centre located in Koton Karfe, Kogi State. DAILY POST gathered that, heavy downpour on Monday morning in Koton-Karfi, aided the escape of the prisoners after the collapse of some parts of the Federal medium prison building while many houses were submerged by the flood in the community. It was reliably gathered that the rain started at about 2 am on Monday, which created havoc leading to the destruction of some parts the prison building, which gave way for the inmates to escape. When our correspondent visited the community on Monday, some of the people, who spoke with our reporter, said the rain was very heavy and it fell for several hours. According him, it was due to the heavy downpour that caused the flood, which affected many houses and the prison building. The acting Chief Imam of Koton-Karfi Karfi central mosque, Saidu Suleiman Nuhu, who also spoke with our reporter, said river Osugu over flooded its bank and destroyed so many houses including the prison, which led to the escape of some inmates. However, effort to speak with Prison officers, who visited the scene proved abortive as every where was flooded but source close to the Prison service disclosed that about 228 of the inmates who escaped only 100 have been rearrested by the security agents. The source added that the Deputy Controller General of Correctional Service Ahmed Jafaru had visited the place saying government will put everything in place to re-arrest some inmate who are still at large.
