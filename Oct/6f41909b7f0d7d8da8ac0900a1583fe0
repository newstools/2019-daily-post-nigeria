The Kano State Election Petition Tribunal has upheld the victory of the state Governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje. The tribunal, on Wednesday declared that the petition filed against Ganduje by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate, Abba Yusuf lacked merit. Delivering judgment, the Chairman of the three-member panel, Justice Halima shamaki dismissed the PDP’s petition seeking the nullification of Ganduje’s victory in the March 9 governorship election in the state. The Judge held that the petitioners have failed to declare the scores of the 9th March election by tendering certified true copies. She said the petitioners’ participation in the rerun means that they have waived their rights to claim victory in the 9 March election. Most paragraphs in the petitioners’ final address are speculative and therefore struck out. Justice Halima said the Gama result was written manually with a pen, and thus raises questions with regards to its authenticity. The judge also questioned the failure of the petitioners to obtain certified true copies of results as evidence even after the Tribunal had ordered the 3rd respondents which is the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to provide them with them. Shamaki also called for peace in the state and asked the petitioner to go further to Appeal and Supreme Courts if they are dissatisfied with the ruling.
