Gov. Gboyega Oyetola has directed residents living in flood prone areas of Osun State to relocate for their safety. Oyetola gave the directive on Wednesday during his visit to areas ravaged by flood in Osogbo. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the torrential rain, which lasted for several hours on Tuesday evening, sacked many residents from their homes and property worth millions of naira destroyed. Areas mostly affected are: Alekuwodo, Malam Tope, Igbonna, Testing Ground, Ayekale, Awosuru, Rasco Alli, Agunbelewo among others. The governor said the decision to visit the flooded area was a further demonstration of his administration’s commitment to the welfare of the citizens. Oyetola, while sympathising with the flood victims, also urged occupants of buildings located on waterways and canals in the state to relocate temporarily. “I decided to come around so as to assess the collapsed canal that caused the flooding. “We will do the needful to ensure safety by involving the officials of the Ministry of Works and Water Corporation. “We shall do everything to forestall future occurrence. “I will implore people around the canal to evacuate and stay temporarily elsewhere to avoid any disaster. “The government will do everything to help,” the governor said.
