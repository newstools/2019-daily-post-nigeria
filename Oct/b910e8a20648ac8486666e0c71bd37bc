Former Manchester City manager, Stuart Pearce, has said that Liverpool will win the Premier League title ‘comfortably’ this season despite their slip up against Manchester United on Sunday. Liverpool are currently sitting at the top of the table with six points. However, former City manager, Pearce believes Liverpool remain ‘clear favourites’ despite their poor performance at Old Trafford. And he says a six-point lead is still enough to pile the pressure on the defending champions Manchester City side. Pearce told Monday’s Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast, “I think Liverpool will win the Premier League comfortably this year. “I’m not sure they’ll go unbeaten, but I can’t see them losing more than two games. They’re still clear favourites. “Those could be against Manchester City, potentially, but if you go into the game against your nearest rivals with a six point buffer, it will put real pressure on Man City to come out and play. “That might just suit Liverpool.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
