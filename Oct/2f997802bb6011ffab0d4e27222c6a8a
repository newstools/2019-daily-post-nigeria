Mizanbilu Yusuf, 18, has been arrested by the Niger State Police Command for allegedly raping a 9-year-old girl. The suspect confessed to having raped a number of minors in Kafin Koro community in Paikoro local Government Area. The father of the victim reported him to security operatives attached to the Kafin Koro Division. Yusuf, when he was paraded, disclosed that he started the act of defiling minors in his community when he was 17. “I have been in the act and I enjoyed doing it. I do it when I am aroused to have sex and since I do not have a girlfriend, I decided it would be easier to have carnal knowledge of minors in my area to cool off tension. “It is quite unfortunate that I found myself in this hopeless act. I want to warn other teenagers to shun this wicked act. It may destroy their future”, The Nation quoted him as saying. The Niger State Police Public Relations Officer, Muhammad Abubakar, said that the suspect confessed to serial rape and had been charged to court.
