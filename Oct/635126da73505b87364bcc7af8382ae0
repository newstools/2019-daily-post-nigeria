Chelsea coach, Frank Lampard, has revealed that he wants Nigerian-born defender Fikayo Tomori, to commit his future to the club. The Blues have started talks with the central defender to extend his contract until June 2024. Tomori, who graduated from the Chelsea Academy, was brought into the first team fold by Lampard after they were slapped with a transfer ban by FIFA. The 21-year-old has shone since he forced his way into the starting line-up and has started the last six games in the Premier League, scoring against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Addressing a press conference on Friday ahead of Chelsea’s clash with Burnley on Saturday, Lampard was asked if he wants new deals for Tomori and Abraham, and he answered, ”Of course I do, but that is out of my remit. I would want them. They are playing really well.” The 21-year-old contract with Chelsea runs out at the end of the 2020-2021 season.
