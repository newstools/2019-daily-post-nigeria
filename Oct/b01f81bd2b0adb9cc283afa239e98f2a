A former lawmaker representing Kaduna Central senatorial district, Senator Shehu Sani, has suggested that the 2020 appropriation bill presented to a joint session of the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday will not have any positive effect on Nigerians. The President presented N10.7trillion for the year 2020 budget estimates. Buhari also said that N125 billion was allocated to the National Assembly, while N110 billion was allocated to the Judiciary. In his remark, Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, charged all government ministries, departments and agencies to defend their proposals before the end of October. He also said lawmakers should ensure the budget got passed before the end of the year. But reacting in a tweet on Wednesday, Sani said “The Budget will take us out of Sodom and safely land us in Gomorrah.” Other groups and individuals such as the Coalition of United Political Parties, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, had since rubbished the budget.
