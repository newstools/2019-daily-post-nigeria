Governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State, said on Wednesday that civil servants in the state deserve to be paid the new national minimum wage. “Katsina civil servants actually need the new minimum wage as they have been putting in their best to move the state forward,” Masari said at the opening of the 5th quadrennial delegates conference of the state medical and health workers union, in Katsina. Masari explained that inflation and other economic leakages had eaten into the current N18, 000 minimum wage, NAN reports. He, however, urged union leaders to be considerate and show maturity in their agitation, “as government could only give what it has.” Masari reminded the medical and health workers to always give priority to their patients above all other considerations, stressing that saving the life of a patient would be better than huge amount of money in their pockets. Earlier, Hussaini Hamisu, the state chairman of the union, said the conference was to review their performance in the last four years and elect new leadership. He commended the governor for transforming the health sector in the state. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
