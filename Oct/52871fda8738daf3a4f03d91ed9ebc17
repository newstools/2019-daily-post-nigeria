Former Manchester United defender, Gary Neville, has said Manchester City’s poor defence could cost them the title, but admits injuries to Liverpool’s key players could also mean the Reds don’t win it. City’s shock 2-0 defeat by Wolves at the Etihad on Sunday, means Liverpool are eight points clear, the largest margin ever recorded after eight matches. Adama Traore’s late double saw Guardiola’s men lose for the second time this season, leaving their title defence hanging by a thread. “City are not right. They set such a high standard. The back four’s not right, they’re conceding chances and they didn’t do that last year and the year before. “They’re not like they were. And they set such a high standard and Liverpool matched that barring a hair’s breadth last season. And so if City drop below that… “I have to say that not replacing Vincent Kompany now, and obviously the injury to Aymeric Laporte, is a big problem for them because they look vulnerable. Teams will believe they can beat them. “Liverpool are definitely big favourites, but if Van Dijk or Salah get injured all of a sudden it changes again,” Neville said on Sky Sports.
