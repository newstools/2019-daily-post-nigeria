Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has expressed optimism that only a forensic audit of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) would return the interventionist agency to the path of fiscal discipline, accountability, and transparency. The Governor made this known on the heels of the inauguration of the Interim Management Committee by the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio even as he hailed the directive by President Muhammadu Buhari that NDDC be audited. Akeredolu who spoke through his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Ojo Oyewamide via a statement issued on Wednesday and made available to DAILY POST stated that ”The directive by Mr. President that a forensic audit of the NDDC be carried out remains the best in the direction of transparency, accountability, and fiscal discipline. ”Such move, no doubt, sets not just a benchmark but a desirable check on how the agency would be run now and in the near future. The directive is noble and deserves every support it requires. ”It is against this backdrop that I congratulate the three-man Interim Management Committee headed by Dr (Mrs) Gbene Joi Nunieh as the Acting Managing Director. I have no doubt that the team is conscious of the enormity of the assignment before it”, the governor said. The Minister had on Tuesday night, inaugurated a 3-Man interim Committee to oversee the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, while the Forensic Audit is going on. Other members of the committee are: Dr. Hon. Chief Cairo Ojougboh Executive Director Project and Chief Ibanga Bassey Etah, Executive Director Finance.
