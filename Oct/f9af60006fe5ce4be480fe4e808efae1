The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) has reacted to the impeachment of the Deputy Governor of Kogi State, Elder Simon Achuba, by the state House of Assembly. The NBA in a statement on Monday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kunle Edun, described Achuba’s removal as illegal and unconstitutional because it was against the findings of the probe panel raised by the state Chief Judge which cleared him of wrongdoings. Notwithstanding, the Kogi state House of Assembly ratified Edward Onoja’s nomination as the new Deputy Governor after Achuba’s removal. However, the umbrella body of lawyers said it viewed the events with serious concerns and urged all parties to exercise great caution. The statement reads, “Available information indicates that the Honorable Chief Judge of Kogi State in the exercise of his constitutional powers and pursuant to a Resolution of the Kogi State House of Assembly, constituted a 7 man panel, chaired by Mr. John Baiyeshea, SAN, to investigate the allegations of misconduct against the Deputy Governor of Kogi State. “The said Investigation Panel has since submitted its report to the Kogi State House of Assembly, finding the Deputy Governor not guilty and cleared him of all the allegations made against him. “The Nigerian Bar Association views these events with great concerns and urges all parties to exercise great caution. “Any action to be taken by the interested parties should be guided by dictates of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the need to adhere to the Rule of law. Parties concerned should also avoid any act that may pose a threat to the peace and security of Kogi State.” The NBA said it was incumbent on all Nigerians, public officials and public institutions to ensure full compliance and adherence to the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
