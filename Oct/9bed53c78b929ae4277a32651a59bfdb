The intervention of security operatives forestalled an attack on the residence of the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole. Youths had stormed his house chanting songs, ‘Oshiomhole Ole (Thief) Oshiomhole Ole (thief)’ but were dispersed by anti-riot policemen. The Nation quoted Chief Press Secretary to Oshiomhole, Simon Ebegbulem, as saying the thugs were allegedly sent by Governor Godwin Obaseki. Special Adviser to Governor Obaseki on Media, Crusoe Osagie, debunked the allegation against his principal. “The Edo State Government has said it has absolutely no knowledge of the purported attack on the person or the residence of former Governor of the state and National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. “We have no knowledge of the attack. We have also reached out to the Police, and they affirmed that they do not know about such an attack.” In his reaction, Police Commissioner, Danmallam Abubakar, said: “It is a lie. There was no attack. Nothing happened in the area where Oshiomhole lives.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
