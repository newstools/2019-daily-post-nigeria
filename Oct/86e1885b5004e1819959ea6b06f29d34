Ole Gunnar Solskjaer retains the backing of the Manchester United power-brokers and the majority of fans, Sky Sports reports. It is believed the Norwegian will be given time and money to turn his fortunes around at Old Trafford. Solskjaer has admitted on many occasions, that there will be “bumps in the road” or “ups and downs”, as he endures a miserable start to the 2019/2020 campaign. United have managed just two Premier League victories so far this season. They have gone 11 away fixtures without a win, one goal in the last three games and are currently in 12th position, two points above relegations places. However, the board will not fire Solskjaer just yet and will give him ample time, to turn the club’s fortunes around.
