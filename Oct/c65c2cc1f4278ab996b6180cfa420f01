The Chief of Defence Staff, General Abayomi Olonisakin, on Saturday assured Nigerians that Boko Haram insurgency, kidnapping, arm banditry and other criminal acts bedeviling the country will soon be over. Olonisakin, who gave the assurance while speaking at the Passing Out Parade of the 78 Regular Recruits Intake of the Nigerian Army in Kaduna, said the Nigerian Armed Forces will not rest until the lives and properties of the citizens are secured.

He said: “Nigeria is currently facing numerous security challenges occasioned by the activities of Boko Haram terrorists, armed bandits, kidnappers and other criminal elements. “I wish to state that these security challenges will soon come to an end as we will not rest on our oars until the country is safe for all of us. “Today marks yet another chapter in the history of this great institution (the Depot) and the country in general. “I am glad that Depot Nigerian Army has continued to evolve innovative ways of improving the standard in the training of personnel for the Nigerian Army. “This realistic and result oriented training that is being imparted in young recruits here has been yielding positive results. “This is evident by the robust fighting spirit displayed by our soldiers in various theatres of operations.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
