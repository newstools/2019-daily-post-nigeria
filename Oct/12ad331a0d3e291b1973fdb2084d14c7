Juventus manager, Maurizio Sarri, has left Cristiano Ronaldo out of their Serie A fixture against Lecce on Saturday. Ronaldo has started all but one game for this season and has five goals in 10 appearances across all competitions. The Bianconeri travel to Lecce, just four days after coming from behind to beat Lokomotiv Moscow 2-1. And ahead of a busy run of games, Sarri is set to give Ronaldo a break. “With Cristiano, we speak often. “Even for him there will be need for rest. We’ll see based on how he’s feeling. I don’t know when, we will decide. “Right now we don’t have a lot of options in order to completely rotate the squad. We’ll change things with regards to the conditions of the players,” Sarri told a pre-match news conference on Friday.
