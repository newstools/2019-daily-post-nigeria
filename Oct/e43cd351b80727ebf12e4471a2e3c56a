The All Progressives Congress (APC), has reacted to the tribunal ruling against its Sokoto State Governorship candidate, Alhaji Ahmed Aliyu Sokoto. DAILY POST reports that the Governorship Election Petition Tribunal, in Sokoto State had on Wednesday in Abuja affirmed the election of Tambuwal. The three man tribunal dismissed the petition of the APC and its governorship candidate, Ahmed Aliyu, for lacking in merit. In delivering judgment, the Chairman of the tribunal, Justice Abbas Bawale said the petitioners had failed to establish their claims to non compliance with the Electoral Act and the issue of over-voting. Bawale also said the evidence of the petitioners’ witnesses especially witness number ten amounted to hearsay which could not prove any of the allegations. But reacting the party while rejecting the ruling said it will head to the Appeal Court to pursue justice. The statement issued by APC Sokoto Chairman, Alhaji Sadiq Isah Achida, on Thursday reads, “In view of the unfair and unjustifiable ruling delivered by the Sokoto state Governorship Election Petition Tribunal, on Wednesday 2nd October, 2019 the party wishes to state categorically that it rejects the ruling. “Our lawyers are studying the details of the judgment, with a view to filing an appeal at the appropriate court of law.” “Meanwhile, the APC wishes to call on its teeming members across the state to remain calm and peaceful, while the party explored all available legal means to reclaim its stolen mandate. “We wish to thank all our members and electorates in the state for their continued support and loyalty.
