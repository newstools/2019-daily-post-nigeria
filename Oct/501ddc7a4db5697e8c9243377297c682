Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has sacked all political appointees in the eighth local government councils. Those affected were Special Advisers, Senior Special Assistants, Secretary to Local Government and Supervisory Councillors. The sacking was contained in a three-paragraph letter released on Monday evening. It was gathered that the sacking of local government political appointees was supposed to affect only those in Edo North senatorial district where the present national chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole hailed from, but it was later changed to the entire local government areas across the state. Earlier this month, Governor Obaseki had sacked over 300 political appointees in what was seen as a way to sweep dissidents out of his administrations. Although, about four council chairmen, Eghe Ogbemudia (Egor) Hon Patrick Aguinede, (Esan West) Alhaji Yakson Musa in Etsako West and Alhaji Aremiyau Momoh of Etsako East have been suspended for alleged corrupt activities.
