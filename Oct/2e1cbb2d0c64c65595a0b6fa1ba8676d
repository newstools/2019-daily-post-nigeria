Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, on Wednesday hailed his teammates, Luis Suarez and Jordi Alba after winning his sixth European Golden Shoe at the Antiga Fàbrica Estrella Damm in Spain. DAILY POST had reported that Messi received the 2019 Golden Shoe for the highest goal scorer in the Europe top five league competitions after his nearest challenger, Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappe fell short. The Argentine emerged winner with 36 league goals, three ahead of Mbappe. He claimed the award for the third time in a row, since the prize was recreated back in 1968. The 32-year-old now has two Golden Shoes ahead of his nearest rival, Cristiano Ronaldo. “Luis Suarez and Jordi Alba, who are here, and are two of the biggest reasons why I can receive this award. Without my team, I could never have won one. This is a trophy for everyone, a recognition of the entire dressing room,” Messi said after receiving the award. “The Champions League is something special and every year, we want to win it, but we are aware that La Liga is the most important thing. “It is what leads you to performing well in the Copa del Rey and in La Liga. We are at Barcelona and we aim to win everything.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
