Deontay Wilder, American boxer, has insisted that world heavyweight boxer, Andy Ruiz Jr has what it takes to defeat Anthony Joshua during their December 7 rematch in Saudi Arabia. Wilder said Andy Ruiz Jr has a champion’s mindset, a tool that would help him defeat Anthony Joshua during the rematch. The Mexican-American had defeated the Briton earlier in the year to claim the WBA ‘Super’, IBF, and WBO world titles, which would be on the line against Joshua in Saudi Arabia. However, Wilder, in a chat with Sky Sports said Joshua was not a good boxer, hence his defeat was inevitable. When asked if he is backing Ruiz Jr to win, Wilder said: “I am. Ruiz Jr has all the motivation and confidence that he needs from the first fight. “I don’t think he is one to dwell after obtaining a little taste of success. This is just the beginning, especially when you become a champion. “You’ve got to stay hungry. My man Marvin Hagler said you can’t get out of bed in silk pyjamas, but with the win, it was a big boost, and he has the Mexican people around him. “The Ruiz Jr fight is even huger. “Whoever wins is going to be a big fight. “But the biggest fight is me and Ruiz Jr because of his Hispanic background, and he’s American, so he has both sides. “Becoming the first Mexican heavyweight champion is huge because they’ve never had that before. A lot of people who weren’t alert on him, they are now. “It’s bigger than what Joshua could ever be.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
