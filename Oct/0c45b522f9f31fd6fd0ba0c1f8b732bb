Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has hailed Marcus Rashford’s performance, after their 1-1 draw with Liverpool. Rashford put United in front in the first half, before Adam Lallana’s late equaliser. Solskjaer was so impressed with the 21-year-old’s display and described it as his best in 10 months. “It was his best game, maybe, in 10 months for me. “He runs off the shoulder, chases, defends well and got hold of the ball. You could see he is growing and getting stronger. “I’m disappointed we can’t sit here and talk about a win but of course the performance is very positive. “They’re so disappointed in the dressing room but we played against a very good team and we’ll kick on,” Solskjaer told Sky Sports.
