Former Tottenham Hotspur striker, Dimitar Berbatov has urged the club not to replace the current manager, Mauricio Pochettino with former Chelsea and Manchester United coach, Jose Mourinho. DAILY POST recalls that Mourinho is among the top candidates to replace Pochettino, who is under pressure at the club following Spurs’ recent defeats to Bayern Munich in the Champions League and Brighton in the Premier League. Mourinho’s last managerial job was with Manchester United where he was sacked in December. But Berbatov, a former Manchester United star, believes Spurs should continue with Pochettinio and not appoint Mourinho as the club’s new manager. “There has been a lot of talk about Jose Mourinho taking over at Spurs,” Berbatov told Betfair. “As a coach that has been there at the top of his game for so long and has been in every kind of situation, I think he could have the answers for some of the difficulties Spurs are facing. But would he make them better? “I don’t know because it is the same team, yes you can have a bit of a lift in the beginning, like Manchester United did when [Ole Gunnar] Solskjaer came in, but then you need to keep going, otherwise you are going to slip into a spiral. “For me though, Pochettino needs to stay there, he’s been there for a long time. “I remember Sir Alex Ferguson telling us a team needs to be changed when four years pass, not the whole team, but some players. “After four years, some players start to get complacent and they aren’t challenged anymore, they are in with the manager and they are comfortable, so a manager needs to shake things up and bring in new players. “This could be the case with Spurs, a lot of the players have been there a long time and maybe they need to shake things up and try to push the players in a way.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
