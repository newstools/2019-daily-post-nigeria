Magistrate Lukman Sidi who refused to take the plea of Ibrahim, ordered the police to return the case file to the Kaduna State Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for legal advice. “Because of the sensitivity of the case, it is difficult to grant bail, the case file should be duplicated and sent to the office of the DPP for advice,” he said. He has adjourned the case until Nov. 12 for mention, NAN reports. The defendant who is a resident of Jere in Kaduna, is being tried for alleged unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor.
