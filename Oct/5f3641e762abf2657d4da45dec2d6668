The Ogun Command of Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) on Friday confirmed that a kerosene tanker fell on Lagos-Ibadan expressway, injuring the driver. The State’s Sector Commander of FRSC, Mr Clement Oladele, told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Sango-Ota, Ogun, that the accident happened about 7.25 am. Oladele explained that the tanker, a Mack truck with registration number, AGL 755XY, loaded with kerosene and heading to Ibadan from Lagos, lost control and fell at Christopher University area on the expressway. “The suspected cause of the crash is excessive speeding which led to loss of control and the tanker flipped and engulfed in fire. “The Fire Service was immediately invited and the officers extinguished the fire,” he said. He added that seven persons and a Camry car with registration number, AGL 472 FH, were also involved in the accident as it drove into the fallen tanker. Oladele said that the injured driver was taken to Famobis Hospital Lotto, near, Mowe, Ogun, adding that no death was recorded from the accident. He advised drivers, including those driving articulated vehicles to drive with caution within the recommended speed limit to avoid unnecessary road traffic crashes. Oladele added that this measure was necessary because if put in place, whenever a tanker fell as the driver lost control the contents would not escape, thus averting fire outbreak.
