Sergio Ramos has become Spain’s most-capped player ever. The Real Madrid captained his country to a 1-1 draw with Norway in a Euro 2020 qualifier on Saturday, making his 168th appearance. It is one more than goalkeeping legend Iker Casillas made. The 33-year-old centre-back has also become the most-capped European outfield player in the history of the game, surpassing Latvian legend Vitalijs Astafjevs. Ramos has enjoyed a stellar international career, winning the World Cup in 2010, as well as the Euros back-to-back in 2008 and 2012 with Spain. The defender made his first appearance for the senior side on March 26, 2005 against China. SPAIN’S TOP 10
