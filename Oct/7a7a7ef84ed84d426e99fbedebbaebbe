Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State has reacted to his victory at the election petitions tribunal on Friday. He assured that the victory was a reaffirmation of the people’s mandate and he will not let the people down. “I am firmly resolved to work for your good. I will not let you down,” the governor told Adamawa people, according to a statement from the Government House, Yola. The statement, signed by the Director-General of Media and Communications, Mr Solomon Kumangar, said the governor stressed that the victory has added impetus to his drive to make Adamawa State work again. “Governor Umaru Fintiri lauded the Election Petition Tribunal for being upright and just and thanked the citizens of Adamawa State for their support and prayers,” the statement said. It said the governor extended a hand of fellowship to the opposition parties to join hands with him in the task of revamping the fortunes of the state. The Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal for the state gave its judgment in a nine-hour sitting in Yola on Friday on a petition filed by opposition All Progressives Congress (APC). The APC had made allegations of irregularities in the election that produced Ahmadu Fintiri as governor, but the tribunal, in the judgment of Friday, said the APC had failed to prove its allegations. The tribunal consequently dismissed the petition and upheld Fintiri’s election.
