Manchester United are closing in on a deal to sign Juventus forward, Mario Mandzukic, Goal reports. The Red Devils are confident that a transfer fee of £9million will be accepted by the Serie A champions, who are desperate to sell the Croatian veteran. Mandzukic is expected to sign an 18-month contract until the summer of 2021 and would earn a salary of £4.4m a year. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side has failed to score more than one goal in a game, since they beat Chelsea 4-0 on the opening weekend of the season. Mandzukic has enjoyed four excellent years at Juventus since arriving from Atletico Madrid in 2015, winning four straight Italian league titles and scoring 44 goals in 162 appearances. However, the 33-year-old is now surplus to requirements in Turin, with new coach Maurizio Sarri deeming the giant striker unsuitable for his style of football.
