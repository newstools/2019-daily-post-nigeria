Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp has confirmed a fresh blow to his team after Naby Keita picked up a knock during Liverpool’s thrilling 5-5 draw with Arsenal in the Carabao Cup. Keita was recalled to start in midfield alongside Adam Lallana and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain against the Gunners at Anfield as Klopp rotated his squad following last weekend’s Premier League win over Tottenham Hotspur. The Guinea international was enjoying a solid game as Liverpool traded blows with Arsenal in a 10-goal thriller. However, Keita failed to complete the game as he was forced off early in the second half after picking up a knock and he limped off the pitch to be replaced by Curtis Jones in the 55th minute. Speaking at Liverpoolfc.com, Klopp confirmed Keita suffered the injury after slipping over when he lost possession. However, the Liverpool boss hopes the problem isn’t too serious. “If Naby’s injury is not so serious, which I hope, then it was a nearly perfect night,” “He felt a little bit. I saw it, he slipped when he lost the ball. He slipped away, I saw him limping afterwards and that’s why we did it,” he said. Keita will need to be assessed by the Liverpool medical team at Melwood to determine the full extent of the injury but he must now be considered a major doubt for the trip to Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon.
