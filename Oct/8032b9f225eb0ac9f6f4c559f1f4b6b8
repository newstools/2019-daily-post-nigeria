Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA), New York, United States, has expressed its dismay over the continued detention of activist Omoyele Sowore, by the Nigerian Government. Sowore, a pro-democracy campaigner and former presidential candidate, obtained his Master’s degree in Public Administration from the University. The Institution, in a post on its verified Twitter handle, noted that Sowore had contributed to the field of investigative journalism. The tweet reads, “Condemning Omoyele Sowore’s continued detention by the DSS even after reportedly meeting his bail conditions. “Sowore is a world-renowned journalist. He has pioneered new and important avenues in the field of investigative journalism.” Recall that Sowore was arrested by the DSS in Lagos for calling on Nigerians to take in an anti-government protest tagged: “Revolution Now”. Justice Taiwo Taiwo granted him bail and ordered the DSS to release him after he met the condition given by depositing his international passport with the court. Despite that ruling, the federal government refused to free him but re-arraigned him on fresh charges bordering on treason. On Friday however, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the same court again granted Sowore bail but this time with stringent conditions.
Sowore was asked to provide N100m and two sureties in like sum. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
