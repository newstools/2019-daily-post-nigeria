Former England striker, Michael Owen, criticized Manchester United midfielder Fred, following their 0-0 draw with AZ Alkmaar in the Europa League on Thursday. The midfielder, who moved to Old Trafford from Shakhtar Donetsk for £52million in 2018, put in another poor performance in the drab affair. Owen, speaking on BT Sport, highlighted his poor distribution throughout and questioned what is his best role. “He’s just a moderate player isn’t he? That’s the bottom line.
