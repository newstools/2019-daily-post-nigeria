Prolific Nigerian striker, Ademipo Odubeko, could join Zinedine Zidane’s Real Madrid after leaving Manchester United in the summer. According to Don Balon, Real Madrid’s president, Florentino Pérez, who has signed some of the most promising young talents in the world such as, Vinicius, Kubo, Martin Odegaard and Rodrygo Goes in recent years, is interested in signing Odubeko. Odubeko is currently without a club after he decided not to pen a scholarship deal with Man United in the summer. DAILY POST recalls that Odubeko rejected new contract offer from Manchester United in June this year. The 16-year-old, who has been compared to Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappé at his age, scored over 34 goals for Man United’s youth teams last season.
