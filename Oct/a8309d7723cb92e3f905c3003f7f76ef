Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, says the federal government is ready to give the worn-out National Stadium, Lagos, a facelift. Speaking after an inspection tour of the decaying edifice alongside Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu and his deputy, Femi Hamzat on Saturday, the minister said the federal and the state governments would partner on the project. In a series of tweets on his official Twitter handle, the sports minister said:
“As promised, I returned to the National Stadium, Lagos, today for an inspection with the Governor Jide Sanwoolu. “As partners in progress, Lagos government is a critical stakeholder in our quest to turn the facility around. In tow where the Deputy governor. “The commitment of the Muhammadu Buhari Government to the revitalization of sporting facilities is demonstrable. “The Youth and Sports Ministry have his support to develop our sports and we are building linkages that can deliver. “I thank my brother Governor Sanwo-Olu and his Deputy Femi Hamzat for plugging into the renewed zeal to restore our sporting facilities to the glory it deserves.” Built in 1961and expanded in 1972, the hallowed ground for Nigeria’s sporting glory hosted the 1973 All-Africa Games. On the ground, the country lifted their first Africa Cup of Nations title in 1980. However, it has gone into disrepair since the Abuja National Stadium was constructed to host the 2003 All African Games.
