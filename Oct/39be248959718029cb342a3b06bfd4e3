Burnley coach, Sean Dyche has criticised Chelsea forward, Callum Hudson-Odoi for diving during his side’s 4-2 defeat against the Blues in the Premier League on Saturday. Three goals from Christian Pulisic and a strike from Willian gave Frank Lampard’s men all three points against Burnley. However, Jay Rodriguez and Dwight McNeil did score for the Clarets. But Dyche was disappointed with the way Hudson-Odoi went down in the box during the encounter in the second half after pressure from Matt Lowton and James Tarkowski. Referee Michael Oliver pointed to the spot but the decision was overturned by Video Assistant Referee (VAR) and the England international was then carded for diving. Speaking on Hudson-Odoi’s diving, Dyche was quoted by Daily Mail as telling reporters at Turf Moor after the match: “It is shambolic how people dive about the place and we were told by the Premier League the worst you can get is a yellow card, so everyone has a chance to cheat once again and not get sent off. “I keep hearing the word respect, and I get shot down for saying this, but players should respect the game. They have got to do something more (than bookings). I feel worse it is a young player doing it. “They are the future and if they are diving now, we have massive trouble now in five or 10 years. We didn’t use to accept it. Now we do and I am the only who goes on about it. “If I felt like it was a dive I would address it and speak to Callum but I don’t think it as clean-cut as that when you are moving into the box at pace and cutting across defenders.” Dyche added: “There were a lot of things happening today. These things do still happen all over football. Their bench wanted something every time Ashley Barnes fell to the ground.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
