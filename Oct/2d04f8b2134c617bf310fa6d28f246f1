Bayelsa Governor, Seriake Dickson, has told the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, that he lacks adequate knowledge of who he chose as the flagbearer of the party in the forthcoming governorship election. Dickson, who spoke during a chat with journalists in Lagos on Saturday, also dismissed Oshiomhole’s vow that the APC would take over Bayelsa State after the election. Recall that Oshiomhole had flayed Dickson for using ‘unsophisticated language’ against his party’s governorship candidate, David Lyon. Reacting, Dickson said: “My good friend Oshiomhole knows that the APC cannot win Bayelsa in a free and fair election. They can’t win any ward in Bayelsa. None. They have never won any election except intimidating people, manipulating electoral body. He knows that. “He is my good friend. I disagree with his views. I believe he doesn’t know his candidate enough. But in the coming days and weeks, I believe he will get to know the person he has allowed to be the flag bearer. “Since 2015, we have been dealing with extreme violence and abuse of power by the leadership of the party that has the centre. We expect that the elections would not be as violent as the previous ones. “The people of Bayelsa can be trusted to vote for a candidate they believe has the experience, a candidate that they believe understands the issues, a candidate that will continue with the massive development that has come to stay in Bayelsa.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
