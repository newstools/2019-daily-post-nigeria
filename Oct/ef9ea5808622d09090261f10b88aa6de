Tottenham Hotspur captain, Hugo Lloris, has blamed himself and his teammates for giving up too easily during their side’s UEFA Champions League 7-2 defeat against Bayern Munich on Tuesday night. The visiting German Bundesliga giants blistered past Spurs in London, eventually walking away with three points in match-day two of this season’s Champions League. Serge Gnabry made Tottenham look silly as he scored four goals on the night. Robert Lewandowski got in the act, scoring two goals, with Joshua Kimmich getting Bayern’s opener. Son Heung-Min and Harry Kane did score for the hosts, but Lloris was left lamenting the quality of his side after the match, adding that they cannot afford to drop any more points against Red Star Belgrade in their next two games. “I feel really bad for the fans mainly because we gave up a little bit too easily and the score was even worse,” Lloris was quoted by Metro UK as telling reporters after the match. “It is a night that affects a lot. Now it’s about character, clearing the mind. The next two games against Red Star will become even more important, we cannot lose any more points.’ Lloris addedd: “We need to find a solution to find the consistency that was our strength in the last few years. “Since the start of the season we have never played at the same intensity for 90 minutes. As you can see we’re used to playing in a way that demands a lot of energy and focus, and at this level, the opponent punishes you when you start to lose easy balls close to the box. “Today we feel bad for the badge, we feel bad for the fans and now it is to show a reaction on Saturday. This game has become even more important for us.” Lloris will hope to lead Tottenham to victory when they take on Brighton in the Premier League this weekend.
