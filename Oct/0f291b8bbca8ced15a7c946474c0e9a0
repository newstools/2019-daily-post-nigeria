Real Madrid midfielder, Isco has reportedly decided to leave the club in the January transfer window due to lack of more playing time under manager, Zinedine Zidane. Isco, who joined Real Madrid in 2013 from Malaga, started only one La Liga game for the Los Blancso this season. According to Calcio Mercato, the 27-year-old will seek a move away from Real Madrid next year if he continues to miss out on Zidane’s starting XI. The newspaper reports that Isco wants more playing time in order to be included in his country’s squad for the Euro 2020. Isco has so far scored 35 goals in 187 appearances for Real Madrid. The Spain international has also drawn interest from Arsenal in the past few months. He will hope to start for Real Madrid when they take on Mallorca in the La Liga on October 19.
