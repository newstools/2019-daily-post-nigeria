The gunmen, who whisked away a professor in the Modibbo Adama University of Technology (MAUTECH) on Monday have demanded a N10 million ransom. Adamu Zata, a Professor of Soil Science at MAUTECH, was abducted from his house in Girei, near Yola, at 2 am on Monday by gunmen who killed his brother, Dr Sheda Zata. Sheda Zata, a vet doctor, who was said to have decided to spend the night with his brother and to leave the next day back to his rural station after a weekend visit to Yola, reportedly got shot by his brother’s abductors as he was sighted opening his door and coming out of the guest room on hearing noises around the house. A relation of the professor, who gave an update Tuesday on the professor’s abduction, said the kidnappers had demanded N10 million as condition to release him. “They have asked for N10 million, but we are still discussing. We are trying to bring it down,” the family member who objected to being named, told DAILY POST. Professor Adamu Zata is facing kidnappers for the second time in exactly one year. He had been kidnapped in October last year, and he gained his freedom, unconfirmed report later indicated, after his family paid N2 million.
