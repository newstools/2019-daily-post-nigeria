Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has said Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo would struggle at the club. Berbatov, speaking to Betfair, stated that the problems at Old Trafford run deep. He suggested manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær has not recruited enough attacking options and has a tough few months ahead. “The winter transfer window is going to be difficult and on the pitch Manchester United aren’t producing as a team at the moment. “It doesn’t matter how good you are, Messi or Ronaldo could go there and they would have difficulty because the team is not producing,” Berbatov said. United went into the international break 12th on the table, two points clear of relegation places.
