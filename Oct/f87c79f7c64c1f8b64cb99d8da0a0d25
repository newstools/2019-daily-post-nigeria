President Muhammadu Buhari has commiserated with the family of the first man to appear on television in Nigeria, Kunle Olasope, who passed away at 82. He said the deceased left a legacy of excellence in broadcasting and foundation for many to build on. Buhari’s condolence was contained in a statement on Monday by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina. “The President sends condolences to the media industry, especially the broadcast sector, where Olasope shone brilliantly with Nigeria and Africa’s first TV station, Western Nigeria Television, WNTV, becoming a house-hold name”, it said. “President Buhari believes the veteran broadcaster’s contribution to media practice will always be remembered, and the focus of the programmes he anchored, which were mostly educational and informative, will remain relevant and inspiring. “The President prays that the almighty God will receive the soul of the departed and comfort his family.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
