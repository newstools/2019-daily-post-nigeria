Chief Edward Onoja has resigned his position as Chief of Staff to Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, ahead of the November 6 governorship election in the state. Onoja is the running mate to the All Progressives Congress (APC) flag bearer in the November 16 election. A letter by the Secretary to the State Government, Mrs. Folashade Arike Ayoade Arike, named former Director General (Protocol), Abdulkareem Jamiu as the new Chief of Staff to the governor. Jamiu is replaced by Dr. Gabriel Ottah as DG Protocol. Edward’s emergence as running mate to Governor Bello had been highly speculated and was confirmed shortly after the blown rift between Bello and his deputy, Elder Simon Achuba, who is currently facing impeachment proceedings. The letter of the new political setup reads: “Consequent upon the resignation of the former Chief of Staff to the Governor of Kogi State, Chief Edward Onoja, His Excellency, Alhaji Yahaya Bello has approved the appointment of former Director General (Protocol), Pharm. Abdulkareem Jamiu as Chief of Staff to Excellency. “His Excellency has also approved the appointment of Dr. Gabriel Ottah as DG Protocol to His Excellency. The appointment takes effect from the 14th. October 2019.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
