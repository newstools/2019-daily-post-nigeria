The FCT Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma, told newsmen in Abuja on Wednesday, that the suspect allegedly defrauded some people promising to award contracts to them. He said the suspect had so far defrauded his victims of N52 million. “The suspect stated that he had access to classified information because he served in the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) during his National Youth Service Corp (NYSC) attachment. “We recovered some exhibits including 206 Peugeot with Registration Number ABJ 856 SU, one Tricycle with registration Number KEF 807 WT, one 55″ and 46 inches Samsung Plasma TV and one dining set from Bello. “Other exhibits recovered are 10,000 watts Fireman Generator set and one Washing Machine Hisense Deep Freezer, which the suspect claimed to have purchased from the money he received,” Ciroma said. The commissioner said that efforts are in place to arrest his cohorts, one Simon ‘m’ and one Idris ‘m’ posing as the Director of Procurement of FCTA and Personal Assistant to the Minister.
