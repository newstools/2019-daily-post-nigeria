The new ministry created by President Muhammadu Buhari, Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management is off on a rocky start as budget office cuts it proposed budget of N56.9billion for capital expenditure to N3.08billion. The Minister of the Ministry, Sadiya Umar Farouq revealed this at the budget defence before the House of Representatives committee on Women Affairs and Social Development on Monday. The minister noted that ministry made a proposal for capital expenditure to the budget office, but the proposal was significantly slashed. “The ministry’s budget proposal for the year 2020 proposed by the ministry to the budget office was significantly higher, the ministry headquarters was allocated N3.082billion for capital expenditure as against N56.9 billion initially proposed for relevant programmes,” she said. The minister earlier disclosed that the ministry will help the administration with the aspiration of moving 100million, however, this assertion was challenged by an All Progressives Congress (APC) member, Aisha Dukku that the budget for the ministry can not help to lift 100million out of poverty. “I want to know since you are in charge of social development and government programmes like the N-power, trader moni, because it is social development we are talking about, you have a huge task, because N3.082billion for your capital cannot bring out 100 million people out of poverty, and so I believe you have a very big task, what I will suggest that a special case be made that certainly, you can not bring out 100million Nigerians out of poverty.” Although, the budget for the headquarters exclude the Social intervention allocations. The minister, therefore, appealed to the committee, to help review the budget of the ministry.
