Mr Samuel Okolie, a staff of Auchi Polytechnic, Mr Samuel Okolie, who was said to have been abducted by gunmen on Oct. 9 has been found dead. Okolie was found dead on his farm at Aviele community, near Auchi in Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo State on Sunday. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Okolie was said to have been abducted on his way to his farm after close of work to pick people working for him. His mutilated body was dumped close to a truck he was said to be driving when he was abducted by the gunmen. But the Commissioner of Police in Edo State, Mr Danmallam Mohammed, who confirmed the incident, said that Okolie was not abducted. Mohammed said the death was “probably a case of suicide as parts of the deceased’s body was bathed with acid. “It is probably a case of suicide because nothing was taken away from him and also from his vehicle. “You know the rate of suicide is very high and his own cannot be an exception.” The commissioner said, however, that investigation would be carried out by the command to ascertain what led to Okolie’s death.
