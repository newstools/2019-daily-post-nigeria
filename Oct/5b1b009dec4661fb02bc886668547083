Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said he does not need assurances about his future from the board and is planning for the long term at Old Trafford. Speaking to Sky Sports ahead of a Super Sunday clash with Liverpool, the under-pressure United boss backed the club’s recruitment plans and said he is in the process of changing the culture of his squad. “All the talks I’ve had with the owners, with Ed Woodward and the club have been about me having a three-year contract. “We’re planning long-term. I’ve been given the job and if you lose a game or two, you don’t wait for a call to be given assurances. “But we started out with a plan and a recruitment plan is in place. I’m 100 per cent sure from my time here that the structure is right because it is always the manager who has the final say,” Solskjaer said. United go into this weekend’s game in 12th place, two points above relegation places.
