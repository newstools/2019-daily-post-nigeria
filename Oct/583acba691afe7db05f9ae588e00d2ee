Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has disagreed with VAR’s decision, to award his side the first of their two penalties in a 3-1 victory over Norwich on Sunday. United won thanks to goals from Scott McTominay, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial. Solskjaer’s men could have scored more, but goalkeeper Tim Krul saved two spot kicks. The controversial call came just before the half-hour mark, when Ben Godfrey tangled with United winger Daniel James and referee Stuart Attwell initially seeing no foul. However, after a lengthy VAR intervention, he changed his decision. Krul stepped up and saved Rashford’s effort from 12 yards. “VAR is there to help but when it takes ages like the first penalty, it is not a clean and obvious error. “When it took that long, it is a signal that it should not have been,” Solskjaer said after the game.
