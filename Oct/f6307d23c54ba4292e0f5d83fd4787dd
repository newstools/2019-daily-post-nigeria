Edo state chapter of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has threatened to suspend its members who floated the Edo Peoples Movement, a caucus of the party. Briefing journalists on Thursday after the State Executive Council meeting of the party which had Governor Godwin Obaseki in attendance, Anselm Ojezua, the state chairman of the party, said the party would not stop at suspending those forming parallel groups but would recommend them for expulsion. The APC chairman said, “The meeting was to discuss issues of formation of a group within the party and on what the constitution says about that. “We reached the conclusion that the constitution of the party forbids the formation of a parallel-group within the party. It is anti-party, it works to weaken the fabrics of the party and it must be discouraged. “So we are going to take steps to deal with those issues. “In our constitution, we have various punishments for various offences. This one goes with suspension with the possibility of expulsion but it is the National Executive Committee that has the power for expulsion. We can only make recommendations.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
