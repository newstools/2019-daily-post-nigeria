Leicester City midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, has warned the Super Eagles to defend well against Brazil when both sides clash in Sunday’s international friendly match at the Singapore National Stadium after watching how the Selecao drew 1-1 with Senegal on Thursday. Nigeria head to the game following a 2-2 draw with Ukraine in their last friendly match but Ndidi believes Gernot Rohr’s side will try their best to beat the five-time World Cup champions. “We watched the game between Brazil and Senegal, it was a good game and we have been preparing based on that, plus working on our shape,” Ndidi was quoted by Sporting Life as saying. “We have to find our solutions, while we’re trying to deal with them, we are also mindful of our back.” The kick-off time for the match is 1pm.
