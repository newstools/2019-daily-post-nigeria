The Chairman of the House of Representatives committee on Power, Magaji Aliu, on Friday slammed the budget of the National Electricity
Management Services Agency (NEMSA) describing it as “copy and paste.” The lawmaker stated this on Friday during the budget defence exercise, expressing dissatisfaction with the budget which he said was laden with errors. “I think something is wrong. This presentation is not acceptable to me and to this committee; budget defence is not a jamboree but a constitutional responsibility. “With the full complement of staff of the agency, this is not acceptable,’’ he said. The chairman ordered the management of the agency to rework the budget, and bring it back. The Managing Director of NEMSA, Peter Ewesor told the committee that the budget will be reworked. They have till 7pm to submit the budget. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
