Popular Nollywood actress, Regina Daniels has given actual reason she got married to 58-year-old Ned Nwoko, billionaire Nigerian politician.

She added that she did not marry someone within her age bracket because she is a stubborn person and will not respect him. The actress in an interview with Daddy Freeze said: “I don’t think I can marry someone of my age because I’m very stubborn, My head is not down. “My stubbornness can’t make me marry a young man but Mr. Nwoko has been able to cope with my stubbornness because I respect him a lot. “I call my husband despite his age “baby” “When I made up my mind to marry Mr Nwoko, I was more worried about what my family members would say and not what Nigerians had to say. Nwoko on his part denied reports that he met Regina through her mother, Rita. According to him, he met Regina, they fell in love and within three weeks, they were married. “Actually, some people thought I met her through her mother.
