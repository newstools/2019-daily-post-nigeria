Former Super Eagles captain, John Obi Mikel, has backed Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, to succeed at Stamford Bridge for many years. The Trabzonspor midfielder also said that he would not mind becoming Lampard’s assistant at Stamford Bridge when he retires from playing football. Both Mikel and Lampard were teammates at Chelsea for close to a decade. The duo won several trophies at the Blues including the 2012 UEFA Champions League trophy. “I am very happy for Frank. When we were playing at Chelsea, we knew that him and John Terry would be very good managers, but we were expecting Terry to reach that level first, but Lampard made a big step to become Chelsea manager. His arrival at Chelsea means the club cares for their legends,” Mikel told Sport Witness. “I joked with him after the Chelsea move, I want to be his assistant when I retire. I hope he will be successful at Chelsea for many more years. “I also want to see John Terry in similar jobs in the future because he was our leader on the pitch.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
