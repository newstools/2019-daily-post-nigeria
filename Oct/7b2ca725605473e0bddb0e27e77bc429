Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has revealed N’Golo Kante and Ross Barkley are doubts for the weekend, after being ruled out of the midweek Champions League clash against Ajax.
Kante has endured a frustrating season so far, with a couple of injuries limiting his game time. The 28-year-old midfielder missed Saturday’s 1-0 win over Newcastle United and has also been ruled out of Wednesday’s meeting with Ajax. Barkley started for Chelsea at the weekend, but hobbled off shortly before half-time and will also be absent tomorrow evening in Amsterdam. Antonio Rudiger, meanwhile, is nursing an injury and has not travelled with the rest of the Chelsea squad. Asked to provide an update on the injured trio, Lampard told reporters: “Obviously they are all not here. “Ross [Barkley] will hopefully be fit to train on Thursday. Rudiger has trained today, but it was only a small programme. He’s out of contention for this weekend but will hopefully be back soon. “N’Golo is training again but it’s not clear whether he will be fit for the weekend or not.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
