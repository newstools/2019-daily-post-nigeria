Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has praised the influence of Chelsea midfielder Jorginho on and off the pitch and has confirmed that the Italian is the club’s vice-captain behind Cesar Azpilicueta. Jorginho has won over fans playing under Lampard, after enduring a turbulent time under Maurizio Sarri last season. Asked if the 27-year-old has now assumed the role of vice-captain, Lampard told reporters on Friday: “Yes, Jorginho is vice-captain as it stands. “Azpi [Azpilicueta] is captain, that was clear at the start of the season, and I think his professionalism and his career here speaks for itself. “And Jorginho, I keep talking about him as a character, and he’s a driver. I think it’s very evident to see on the pitch. So that’s the situation as it stands.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
