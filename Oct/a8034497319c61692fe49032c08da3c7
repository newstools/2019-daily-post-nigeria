The Nasarawa State Police Command says it has arrested 112 suspected criminals between August and September, this year. Mr Bola Longe, the Commissioner of Police in the state made this known to newsmen on Thursday in Lafia. Longe gave the breakdown of the suspects to include: 11 for armed robbery, 62 for cultism, 17 for culpable homicide, four for kidnapping, and five for burglary and theft. He explained that most of the suspects arrested for cultism and armed robbery were from the Mararaba/Masaka axis of Karu Local Government Area with others from different parts of the state. He attributed the feat to the relentless effort of the command through the instrumentality of “Operation Puff Adder”. Longe commended the collaboration of members of the public for availing the police with useful intelligence leading to the arrest of the suspects. The commissioner of police said 15 firearms, including an AK 47 riffle and 24 rounds of ammunition, were recovered from the suspects. Other items recovered include N513,990 cash, bundles of wrapper, over 60 mobile phones, a golf car, two motorcycles and a tricycle. Also recovered were machetes, clubs, Army camouflage and wristwatches. He said some of the suspected cultists have already been charged to court.
Longe maintained that the command has re-strategised its operation and have succeeded in chasing out the packets of criminals operating around Nasarawa Eggon – Akwanga axis. “We want to state with a high sense of commitment that the command will not let off its guard. “We will continue to strategise and hype our operational architecture with a view to reducing the criminal activities in the state,” NAN quoted him as saying.
