Following the flood occasioned by the release of water from Oyan Dam, which has submerged its headquarters office in Ogun State, the management of Core TV News has announced a temporary shutdown of the station. In a statement released to DAILY POST, the Managing Director and founder of the station, Olajide Adediran, said the decision, though a painful one to take, was designed to safeguard the lives of its members of staff and the station’s multi million naira equipment from further damage. He urged the Ogun State Government and other stakeholders to find a lasting solution to the issue of release of water from the Oyan Dam, assuring the general public that the station would bounce back in the next few days once the situation improves with the flood water expected to recede in the coming days. While pledging the commitment of the management to lending its platform for advocacy in finding a lasting solution to the challenges posed by the issue, he added that the issue of flooding in Isheri Estates where the headquarters of the station is located is one that requires the cooperation of all stakeholders. He said: “The operations of the station have become near impossible over the last 48 hours following the rise in water levels in its discovery gardens estate headquarters within the Isheri/Opic estates just off the Lagos/Ibadan expressway. “We plead with our staff members and our teeming viewers to be patient and endure with us, we shall come back on air as soon as the situation is receded. “We are assuring them that the station will continue to uphold the highest level of responsibility and professional ethics in its day to day operations.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
