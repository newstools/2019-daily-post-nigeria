Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, will send two of his left-backs out of the club and pursue the transfer of Leicester City star, Ben Chilwell, to fill that role, according to The Sun, UK. Chilwell has been a star performer for Leicester of late and seems like a player who could make his way to a bigger club before too long. According to the report, Chelsea are being linked strongly with Chilwell because they don’t see current left-backs Marcos Alonso or Emerson Palmieri in their long-term plans. This is not the first time the England international has been mentioned as a target for the West Londoners. He had earlier been linked with the club with a price tag of around £50million. Chilwell had also been linked with Manchester United, who could also do with an upgrade on the inconsistent and injury-prone Luke Shaw. Alonso scored Chelsea’s winning goal against Newcastle at the weekend. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
