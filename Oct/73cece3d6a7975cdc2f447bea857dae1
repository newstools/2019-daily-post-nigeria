A Kaduna Chief Magistrates’ Court on Monday, ordered a 23-year-old trader Mubarak Musa, who attempted to have sexual intercourse with a 14-year-old boy to be remanded in prison, pending legal advice. Magistrate Hajara Dauda, who did not take the plea of Musa, ordered the police to return the case file to the Kaduna State Director of Public Prosecutions. NAN reports that she adjourned the case until Oct. 31 for mention. Musa, who resides in Ungwan Dankali, Zaria, Kaduna, is charged with attempted sodomy. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Insp. Sunday Baba, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on Sept. 30. Baba said that the suspect lured the boy into his room and attempted to have anal sex with him. “The defendant was caught and arrested in the act while trying to remove the boy’s trousers,” Baba said. He said the offence contravened sections 57 and 259 of the Kaduna State Penal Code Law, 2017.
