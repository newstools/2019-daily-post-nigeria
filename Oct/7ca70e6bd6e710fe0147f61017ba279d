As Electorates await the November 16th governorship election, Pastor Joshua Ibitomi of the Apostolic Church, Ganaja Assembly Lokoja, on Sunday said God will not allow bloodshed in Kogi State, urging electorates to ignore the fear of possible violence and come out and vote for the candidate of their choice. Pastor Ibitomi made this known during his church sermon in Lokoja on Sunday. He said the church had been praying and fasting for several months to avert the plans of the enemies in the state, stressing that, God has concluded his work to protect his people during the exercise. According to him, electorates should put aside the fear that election might be marred by violence, and come out to exercise their franchise. The clergy also stated that, the will of God will prevail in the election just as he admonished security agencies, the Independent Electoral Commission, INEC and all the political gladiators to have the fear of God to prevent any casualties. He noted further, that absence of the fear of God are some of the reasons there is electoral fraud, and violence during election. Ibitomi also emphasized the need for Nigerians to rediscover their lost virtues which is the fear of God saying, ” During the old days, people on earth feared God. But what we have today, is the reverse. When there is the fear of God among the people, none of us will be talking about insurgency, kidnappings, corruption or violence in our country. We are now living in a society where there is no value for human lives. The people must change their ways before things get out of hands. “If politicians fear God, I don’t think anybody will be scared of violence in November. I’m using this sermon to enjoin our people in Kogi State that the forthcoming election will be peaceful. Nobody should be scared of coming out to cast their votes”.
