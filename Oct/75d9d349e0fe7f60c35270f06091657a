Real Madrid president, Florentino Perez, is at loggerheads with manager Zinedine Zidane, over transfer targets. Perez is considering a move for Tottenham’s Christian Eriksen in January, but Zidane’s priority remains Manchester United’s Paul Pogba, according to ESPN. Zidane made public his admiration for Pogba in the summer, but Madrid were unable to meet United’s valuation. Eriksen, who hinted at a Spurs exit in the summer, is in the final year of his contract. Injuries in midfield have hampered Madrid this season and it is believed that an offer of €30million for the Denmark international, could be enough to seal the deal in January. One potential stumbling block, though, is that Eriksen would prefer a summer move as he could then request a higher signing-on bonus, as there would be no transfer fee. However, Zidane still has his heart set on signing Pogba. Despite having been told by Perez that United refuse to sell the player, Zidane is unconvinced as he believes his compatriot has a strong desire to make the switch to the Bernabeu.
