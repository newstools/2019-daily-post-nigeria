Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has hailed winger, Christian Pulisic, following his side’s Premier League 4-2 victory over Burnley on Saturday. Three goals from Pulisic and a strike from Willian gave Lampard’s men all three points against Burnley. However, Jay Rodriguez and Dwight McNeil did score for the host against the Blues at Turf Moor. “I know what a good player Christian Pulisic is. There are things he needs to learn, he’s just turned 21,” Lampard was quoted by Football London as telling reporters after the game. “He’s knows that I’m driving that daily in training. I’m really pleased for him. That’s what we need from all our attacking players. “I’m delighted for him. Lot of talk around Christian and his price tag, I know the pressures of a move like that and he played for his country in the summer. “I need them all to perform when in the team. He’s been doing that recently.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
