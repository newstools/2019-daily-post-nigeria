The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Saturday, berated President Muhammadu Buhari for congratulating the Ethiopian Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, on winning the 2019 Nobel Prize award. Ahmed was declared the winner of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize on Friday in Oslo, Norway. Congratulating Ahmed, Buhari had said the award portends a good sign for the peace processes within countries, and across borders on African continent. A statement to DAILY POST on Friday had said “President Buhari felicitates with the Prime Minister, his cabinet and all Ethiopians on the remarkable global recognition of winning the 100th peace prize, which was attributed to a decision to end the 20-year conflict between two African countries, Ethiopia and Eritrea. However, Kanu faulted Buhari’s congratulatory message, saying the Ethiopian Prime Minister got the award for his role in the referendum that split Ethiopia and Eritrea. In a tweet, the IPOB leader wrote: “Jubril-Buhari’s CONGRATULATIONS to Ethiopian PM (Ahmed) for winning the #NobelPeacePrize for “his work to end the conflict between Ethiopia & Eritrea” is a CONTRADICTION, because major reason for the Prize was Ahmed’s key ROLE in the #Referendum that SPLIT Eritrea from Ethiopia.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
