Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has lauded forward, Nicolas Pepe for his impressive performance against Vitoria in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday night. Pepe came off the bench to score two late free-kicks goals against Vitoria as Arsenal defeated the Portuguese side 3-2 at Emirates Stadium. However, Gabriel Martinelli did score a goal for the Gunners, while Marcus Edwards and Bruno Duarte also scored for the visitors. “New players usually need time for that adaptation and Pepe is a good player we believe in totally,” Emery was quoted by Football London as telling reporters after the match. “He’s improving and tonight his two goals were very important. We are very happy for him. “He was trying a lot of set pieces last week and I was expecting him to shoot after that. “I think the most important thing is the three points and how individual players can improve.” Pepe will now hope to lead Arsenal to victory when they take on Crystal Palace in the Premier League this weekend.
