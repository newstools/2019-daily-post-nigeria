I prepared myself for every circumstance. “Yeah, I believe that I can be the best in the world, and help Brazil be the best in the world. “There were disappointments, defeats, I made a lot of mistakes. “I have been playing for the national team for almost 10 years and I have a lot of responsibility and carry a lot of pressure. “I don’t hide any of this and if you look at my 10 years, I have developed a good chapter here. I had my time when I was a junior player and now, I am one of the most important players in the world. “This is not a lack of humility. I think no one here is jealous about that and it was the same with me. I wasn’t jealous about this kind of players when I was a young player. “If you are persistent, you believe in the battle, you can be victorious in the end. I’m very happy to reach the 100-cap mark.”  Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
