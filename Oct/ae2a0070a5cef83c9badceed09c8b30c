Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, on Monday, said the agency will come after any person alleged to be corrupt. According to Channels TV, Magu distanced himself and the anti-graft agency from political inclination. “I don’t care who you are, where you come from. The political inclination is not an issue, so there is no question of identifying the chairman of a political party under investigation. “If you are corrupt, I’ll go after you. You can see the two governors who were convicted were APC governors; there is no doubt about that,” he was quoted as saying. Magu also explained that the agency does not invite people on a hear-say basis, but only when there is something linked to the person. “If you are corrupt, we usually conduct a very thorough preliminary investigation before we go after you, that’s why if you are invited by EFCC, there must be something. “I think the fear factor is helping a lot,” he added.
