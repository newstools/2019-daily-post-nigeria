The forums of the All Progressives Congress (APC) states’ chairmen in the South-East and the South-South have registered support for President Muhammadu Buhari’s order for a forensic audit of the Niger Delta Development Commission’s (NDDC) accounts. The party chairmen made their position known in a press statement in Abuja on Sunday. Recall that President Buhari called for a forensic audit of the commission from 2001 to 2019 when he received a delegation of the state executives led by the governor of Bayelsa, Seriake Dickson. However, the statement signed by the chairman of APC in Akwa-Ibom State, Hon. Ini Okopido and leader of the South-South chairmen of the forum, and his Abia State counterpart, Hon. Donatus Nwankpa, who is the leader of South-East chairmen of the forum respectively, also called on Buhari to urgently inaugurate the new board to superintend over the commission’s activities for a holistic review and reforms. The forum expressed satisfaction with the calibre of those the President has already appointed to take over the task of the region’s development and appealed for their inauguration to pilot the affairs of the Commission, bringing to bear their wealth of experience. “The forum is of the view that since neither the Chairman nor Managing Director designate of the newly constituted NDDC board has served in the Commission in the period 2001 to 2019 in reference, they will be able to dispassionately carry out reforms that will revamp the Commission and correct the inadequacies of the previous boards vis-a-viz address the infrastructural decay in the region,” the statement said. The APC state chairmen, however, stated that anyone who has served in the previous boards under investigation should be dropped by the Senate to avoid interference with the audit process.
