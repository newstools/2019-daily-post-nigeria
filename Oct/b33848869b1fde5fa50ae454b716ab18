Tottenham Hotspur said they would take the strongest possible action after several hundred Red Star Belgrade fans defied a UEFA ban to attend the Champions League Group B tie on Tuesday. Red Star fans were barred from buying tickets for the clash in North London as punishment for racism by some of their fans during a Champions League qualifier against HJK Helsinki. Yet, a boisterous contingent was making themselves heard in the upper-tier behind the goal, although they did not have much to cheer as their team were hammered 5-0. It is not clear how they obtained the tickets but Tottenham said they would come down hard on any home fans who sold their ticket to visiting fans. A Tottenham spokesman said in a statement after the match, “Red Star supporters illegally obtained individual tickets on Level 5 and made their way around to one section of the stadium in order to congregate as a group. “Stewards and police contained the group as it was too large a number to eject. “We have launched a full investigation in order to understand how tickets have been acquired. “We shall take the strongest possible action against any individual found to have sold their ticket on.” A UEFA spokesman said they would await reports before deciding on any action Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
