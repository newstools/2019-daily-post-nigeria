Four people have been arrested and are being detained in Adamawa State for allegedly being specialists in snatching commercial tricycles (Keke NAPEP) from owners. DAILY POST learnt on Thursday that the state Police Command apprehended the four on October 27, 2019, after they inflicted injuries on one Keke NAPEP rider in the state capital, Yola, and made away with his Keke. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Sulaiman Nguroje, said of the incident, “The Command patrol team in Yola, in the night of October 27, apprehended four suspected armed robbers who specialise in snatching KeKe NAPEP after injuring or killing the rider.” He said the Keke robbers nearly got their last victim killed by tying him around the neck. “They tied the neck of the KeKe NAPEP driver with rope and pushed him out, but luckily, the rider survived,” Nguroje said. Keke NAPEP, the only form of public intracity transport in Yola, is frequently used for criminal purposes. A group of youths named Shilla Boys, routinely used Keke NAPEP to perpetuate crime until Governor Ahmadu Fintiri, on being sworn in on May 29, took measures that have largely curtailed the Shilla Boys’ menace.
