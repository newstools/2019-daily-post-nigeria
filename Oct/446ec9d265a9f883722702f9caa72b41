Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has asked fans to love the Europa League as much as he does. The Spaniard won the competition three times with Sevilla and led the Gunners to the final last season. Emery is now eager to go a step forward and win the competition, so the club can play in the Champions League next season. Speaking ahead of Thursday night’s group match at home to Standard Liege, Emery told reporters: “I want to feel not just I love that competition – I want everybody to love it. “It is a great competition and it is a way into the Champions League.” Arsenal are top of Group H, following a 3-0 win over Frankfurt on Match Day 1.
