Four-time African Footballer of the Year, Samuel Eto’o, has named former Barcelona teammate, Andres Iniesta, as the greatest player he ever played with. Eto’o and Iniesta enjoyed some memorable years at Camp Nou where he spent five seasons, winning three La Liga titles, two Champions League, two Super Cups and a Copa del Rey together. However, the 38-year-old believes naming current Barca captain Lionel Messi as his best ex-teammate would have been too easy. Eto’o instead plumped for Iniesta and his ‘superb technical ability’. “I shared a dressing-room with many great players,” Eto’o told LaLiga Africa. “If I have to choose one I would say Iniesta. “He impressed me from the first day…Messi is obviously from another planet so we can put him aside, but Iniesta made me say ‘wow… hats off’.” DAILY POST reports that Eto’o scored 162 LaLiga goals in 280 Spanish Primera Division games for Real Madrid, RCD Mallorca and Barca.
