The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has called on the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) to punish a Bauchi-based lawyer, Barrister Phil Bege Elisha, for dragging it before a magistrate court in the state. DAILY POST gathered that the village head of Wuntin Dada community of Bauchi Alhaji Uba Muhammad, asked Barrister Phil to file a suit against the commission over alleged violation of fundamental human rights by raiding the community for investigation of alleged corrupt acts. The lawyer, therefore, instituted the suit before the Chief Magistrate Court 6, Yelwa Bauchi. However, counsel to EFCC Barrister Ahmad Muttaka Yakubu on Thursday told the court that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the case as EFCC is a federal government agency. He also explained that only a federal high court can entertain a case involving the commission or any other federal institution. The petitioner, therefore, applied for withdrawal of the suit, which was granted by the court chaired by Magistrate Ahmed Shuaibu. Commenting further on the development in an interview with journalists, the EFCC counsel asked the leadership of the Nigerian Bar Association to sanction Phil for ‘acting against the Constitution’ and wasting the commission’s times and resources to come all the way to the magistrate.
