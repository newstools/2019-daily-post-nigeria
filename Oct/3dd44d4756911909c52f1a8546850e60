The Federal High Court, Abuja, on Wednesday, fixed Oct. 22 for ruling on an application filed by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and its governorship candidate, Natasha Akpoti. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Akpoti is challenging her exclusion from the Nov. 16 governorship election in the state by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Akpoti was said to have been disqualified by INEC for choosing Mohammed Yakubu, whom it described as underaged, as her running mate in the forthcoming election. When the matter was called, Counsel to Akpoti, Mr Ola Olanipekun, SAN, prayed the court to grant an order directing INEC to recognise her as the SDP candidate. He also sought for an order restraining INEC from further subverting the interest of the candidate. Counsel to INEC, Mr Magnus Onuoha, however, told the court that the SDP never had a valid candidate ab initio. He said this was because the party submitted its list of candidates on Sept. 9, which was the last day of submission, arguing, therefore, that Akpoti had no legal right. The judge, Justice Folashade Giwa-Ogunbanjo, adjourned the matter till Oct. 22 for ruling on the matter.
