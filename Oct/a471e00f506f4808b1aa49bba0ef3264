Chelsea striker, Tammy Abraham, has revealed that his team-mates were “upset” with Frank Lampard’s pre-season running drills. But Abraham admits all that hard work is now worth it, after four straight wins. Two consecutive victories in the Premier League, have seen the Blues rise up to fifth in the table. “I think a lot of players were a bit upset about how much running we had to do in pre-season, but it’s all paying off now. “It all makes sense why we did it, why we had such a hard pre-season. “From when the manager came in he told us the style of play, how he wanted us to play, how to press. “At first, I couldn’t do it. I had no energy. But as the season has gone on, I’ve got used to it. “Now we know what he wants in the press, so for us, it’s about giving defenders no time on the ball – just rushing them,” Abraham told The Athletic.
