Lagos State has recorded another building collapse. DAILY POST reports that this is the second in 12 hours. In the wee hours of Saturday, a house caved in at Orisha community in Magodo. Four persons were feared dead. The latest collapse happened at Rademo Street, behind Recreation Center, Ita Elewa, Ikorodu. Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, LASEMA, said it was caused by the day’s torrential rain. He added that no life was lost.
