Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has hailed Federico Valverde’s form, after their 4-2 win over Granada on Saturday. Valverde, 21, made his third straight LaLiga start for Madrid, setting up a goal for Eden Hazard, as Los Blancos moved four points clear at the top. The Uruguay international’s display was lauded by Zidane, who praised the midfielder’s energy. “I’m happy for him. He deserves it, he’s a player that’ll always prove just how good he is. “He’s improving, he’s doing exceptionally well and he’s always moving forward, he wants to get on the ball and he had a hand in the goals.
“This is a team game and that first-half performance was brilliant in every sense. We did really well in terms of getting out of our half with the ball. “That’s the kind of player he [Valverde] is. He’s a bit of a modern player, he’s got a fantastic engine on him, it’s not only in attack because he puts in just as much work in defence too and that’s important in the modern game and he’s doing well, just as many of them are. “I’m delighted for Fede because he’s getting game time and he deserves it,” the Madrid coach told a news conference.
