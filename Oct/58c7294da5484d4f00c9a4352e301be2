Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has reserved special praise for Arturo Vidal, following their 2-1 comeback against Inter Milan on Wednesday night in the Champions League. Barca went 1-0 down after just two minutes at Camp Nou through Lautaro Martinez’s strike, but Inter failed to capitalise on their impressive first-half performance by scoring a second goal. The hosts battled back in the second half and a Luiz Suarez brace sealed victory. The LaLiga champions drastically improved following the introduction of Vidal in the 53rd minute, after he replaced Sergio Busquets. And Messi hailed the Chilean’s impact after the match. “Arturo gives you so much. He is a player who, when he enters, catches, recovers, arrives, plays. “He is a very important player for us and it is good that he had these minutes today, he felt important because he is a very important player for the team,” Messi told reporters.
