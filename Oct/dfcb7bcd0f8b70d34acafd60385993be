A 21-year-old accused person, Segun Balogun, on Monday collapsed at the Magistrates’ court sitting in Osogbo, after listening to charges preferred against him. Balogun was charged on 3-count charge bothering on stealing, among others. According to the prosecutor, ASP. Adeoye Kayode, the accused person allegedly stole Infinix Hot 6 valued at N37,500, Itel p33 handset at the rate of N23, 000, among other valuables. He added that Balogun committed the offence on 4th October, 2019, at Nelson Mandela Freedom Park, Osogbo. In a mild drama, the court clerk read the first offence on the charge sheet to him and asked if he was guilty, to which he pleaded not guilty. He thereafter passed out in the dock before the clerk could finish reading the second offence. The magistrate, Mrs Risikat Olayemi asked the accused person to be taken to the hospital for proper medication, as she adjourned the matter till 14th day of October, 2019.
