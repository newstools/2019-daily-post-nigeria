Tottenham boss, Mauricio Pochettino, has said he has no intention of dumping the club after recent poor results. After their 7-2 bashing in the hands of Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday, Spurs were beaten 3-0 by Brighton in the Premier League on Saturday. Addressing the press after the game on Saturday, Pochettino, who is now under enormous pressure, said, “My commitment is there after five and a half years. I know very well this business. What I already know is that the faith and belief is there. “That’s not a point now to talk about. “What I told you in the last year or in pre-season is there, but there’s no point in going back. “The point is to try to be positive. The only way you can fight negative energy is to be more positive than it. “I think that is not a topic that is true, to stay all together as long as the club let you stay all together. “As I said to your colleague that is a question for me, but it’s a question that’s not for me.” On Spurs goalkeeper, Hugo Lloris who sustained injury during the game, the Argentina explained, “Of course [Lloris’ injury] affected the game. “We cannot take the credit from Brighton, but the team suffered a massive impact from that action. “We tried to find a different way to play in the second half and we didn’t have much luck. “At 3-0 you could see the game was over. I want to say sorry to the fans and thank them for their massive effort. “I think the news is not good. We have to wait, they are going to explain the real situation. Everyone saw on the pitch when he landed that it wasn’t a good situation.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
