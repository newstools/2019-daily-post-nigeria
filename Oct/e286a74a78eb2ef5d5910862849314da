Paris Saint-Germain superstar, Neymar, is not among the final 30 nominees for the 2019 Ballon d’Or award. His former Barcelona team-mate, Lionel Messi, Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk and Cristiano Ronaldo of Juventus, make the cut which was announced on Monday. The list was decided by a global voting panel of journalists. Messi and Ronaldo’s 10-year grip on the individual award organized by France Football magazine was broken by Luka Modric last December. Modric is also absent one year after he won both the Ballon d’Or and FIFA best player awards. The awards ceremony is December 2 in Paris.
