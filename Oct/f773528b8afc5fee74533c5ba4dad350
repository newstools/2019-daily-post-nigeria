An Abuja Federal High Court has granted bail to the co-convener of RevolutionNow movement, Omoyele Sowore. Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu granted Sowore bail in the sum of N100 million, on Friday and two sureties in like sum. Ojukwu held that the prosecution failed to show good reasons the defendants should not be granted bail since the offences are bailable. The presiding judge restricted Sowore from travelling outside Abuja. Sowore has been in custody of the Department of State Services (DSS) since August 3 when he was arrested in Lagos for calling for a revolution protest against the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration. The former Presidential candidate was arraigned on September 30, alongside Olawale Bakare, his co-defendant, on a 7-count charge of felony brought against him by the federal government. Recall that Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the same court had a few weeks ago ordered the release of Sowore after a detention order the judge issued against him elapsed. Displeased with the order, the secret police had re-arraigned him before Justice Ojukwu. However, Justice Ojukwu also granted the second defendant, Bakare bail in the sum of N50 million and prohibited him from travelling outside Osun State. The judge also barred both Sowore and Bakare from addressing the press until the completion of the trial. Ojukwu ordered that they be remanded in prison custody until the fulfilment of their bail conditions. Counsel to Sowore also asked the court for two weeks’ adjournment. Falana appealed to the court for Sowore to be taken to DSS’ custody instead of prison’s because his client was safer there. The prosecution counsel, Hassan Liman, agreed with Falana’s submission.
