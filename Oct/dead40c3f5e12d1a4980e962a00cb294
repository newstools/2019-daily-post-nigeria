A former Secretary-General, Commonwealth of Nations, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, has canvassed support for President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration on the closure of Nigeria’s border. He made the call on Saturday at the 2019 Investiture of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) in Lagos. Anyaoku said that the closure of the border would boost economic development of the country. “We should support our foreign border closure by President Muhammadu Buhari and his ultimate importance to the home grown policy. “If it will be the government’s concentration in a demonstrable manner on measures for enhancing the country’s development of agriculture and agro industry. “And also for enhancing the country’s manufacturing capacity to be able to serve our internal consumption and export. “It is clear that the abundance variety of Nigeria’s natural resources and our large population constitute adequate phases for the country’s economic prosperity. “If the Federal and State Governments can show a determination to provide the necessary policy and practical support. “And also if our citizens can be persuaded or even coerced through regulation into curbing their appetite for imported, rather than locally produced goods, there will be a tremendous turn around in the economy,” Anyaoku said.
