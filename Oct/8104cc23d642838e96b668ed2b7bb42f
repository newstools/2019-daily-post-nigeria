Nigerian singer, Tiwa Savage, has finally opened up her much-talked-about relationship with fellow musician, Ayodeji Balogun, better known as Wizkid. In a interview with veteran broadcaster, Olisa Adibua on Beat FM, the 39-year-old ‘All Over’ crooner stated that although she is very much single, there is a certain “friends with benefits” kind of friendship between them. When she was pressed to reveal if the friendship was such that they were having casual sex with no emotions attached, Tiwa Savage stated that their friendship was beneficial in a way that they do shows and music together. “We are friends, very good friends. There are few benefits; we do shows together, we do music together, we make money together,” she said.
