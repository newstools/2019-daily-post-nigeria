Staff of the Police Service Commission (PSC), on Wednesday, staged a protest at the Federal High Court, Abuja, over the alleged recruitment of 10, 000 officers by the Inspector General (I-G) of Police, Mohammed Adamu. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the protesters, under the umbrella of the Nigerian Civil Service Union, PSC Chapter, carried placards with various inscription to press home their demands. The protesters converged outside the court premises singing different solidarity songs. The demonstration took place simultaneously as Justice Inyang Ekwo of Federal High Court Abuja delivered ruling on the matter brought by the PSC against I-G Adamu. Secretary of the staff union, Mr Remi Ogundeji, said the staff were protesting against the usurpation of powers of the commission by I-G Adamu. “We all know that it is the constitutional rights of the Police Service Commission to recruit, promote and discipline Nigerian police officers,” he said. Ogundeji said that the PSC and the I-G both began the recruitment exercise together before the commission was no longer carried along by Mr Adamu. “We have instituted an interlocutory injunction to stop the exercise and we sought for the interpretation of the constitution that stipulates the functions of the PSC,” he said.
