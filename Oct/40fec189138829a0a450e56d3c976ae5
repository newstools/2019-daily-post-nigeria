A 30-year-old man, Mohammed Babangida, has been arrested for allegedly defiling a nine-year-old girl. The man, a resident of Damare, a community in Yola Town of metropolitan Yola South Local Government Area of Adamawa State, was picked up for the offence by the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC). The NSCDC, in a statement handed to journalists on Friday, said Mohammed Babangida committed the act on the 10th of this month in Damare where he and the girl live. The state Commander of the NSCDC, Nurudeen Abdulahi, said the suspect was identified and arrested following intelligence report from Damare residents. “The suspect will be charged to court through the intervention and advice by Director of Prosecution (DPP), state Ministry of Justice, which we always partner with on capital offence that amounts to prosecution,” the NSCDC Commander said. The suspect, who responded to questions from newsmen, said he had given the girl N50 and N20 on two respective occasions, that it was on the third occasion when he gave her N50 that he ‘attempted to’ rape her. “I started but I did not finish,” he said, adding that someone knocked on the door and that was how it ended. He asked for leniency, saying, “I have not done it before and I will not try it again. I have wife and children. Government should pity me and not ruin my family.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
