Four persons are now feared dead in Okehi, Etche Local Government Area of Rivers State in a fresh cult clash in four villages in the kingdom. It was gathered that the four persons killed include one each in Ulakwo, Igbodo and Okehi town while buildings and other property were also damaged by rampaging cultists. Trouble started when members of one of the cult groups shot a member of the rival gang at Okehi, the headquarters of Etche LGA. It was further gathered that the killings later escalated to other communities within Etche, as the cult gang whose member was killed went on a reprisal attack. A community source, John Onwubuarili said many houses were burnt down, while residents of the communities have fled their homes for safety. “It is sad that our youths are still involved in this kind of thing. I want all Etche youths who are still engaged in criminality and violent acts to have a rethink and embrace peace and forgive one another,” he said. When contacted, the Rivers state police command confirmed the incident, stating that no life was lost in the cult war. State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Nnamdi Omoni, noted that tactical teams had been deployed in the area by the command, adding that normalcy had been restored in the affected communities.
