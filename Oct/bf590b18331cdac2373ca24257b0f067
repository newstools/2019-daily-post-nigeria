Christian Pulisic became Chelsea’s youngest ever hat-trick scorer, after starring in their 4-2 win over Burnley on Saturday evening. The American forward scored his first three goals for the Blues at Turf Moor, after making his first Premier League start since August.

The England international was 21 years and 347 days old at the time. Pulisic told reporters at Turf Moor: “I’m sure he’s not going to be too happy about that. “But he’s a team player and this is a very special day for me.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
