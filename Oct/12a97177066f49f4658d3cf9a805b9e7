Popular Nigerian cross dresser, Idris Okuneye, who is more popular as Bobrisky, has expressed shock over the arrest of Ismaila Mustapha, a social media celebrity, widely known as Mompha. Mompha was picked up by operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), over alleged money laundering and Internet fraud. Reacting to the arrest, Bobrisky took to his Instagram page to express surprise. According to him, it was difficult to believe it as they both spoke few days ago. “I still find it to believe wat I read about you. I still spoke to you few days ago @mompha but it’s fine. Dis shall pass soon. May God see you through dis tough time because you have an amazing heart,” Bobrisky wrote.
