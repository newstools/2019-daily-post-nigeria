Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, will be without Paul Pogba and David De Gea, for the visit of Liverpool this Sunday. De Gea was forced off the field, during Spain’s European Qualifier with Sweden on Tuesday, with an apparent groin injury. “David needs a scan,” Solskjaer told Sky Sports. “I think he’ll be out. It certainly looked like it anyway judging on last night so it’s just one of those things.” De Gea’s absence means Sergio Romero will make a first league start of the season. Romero has only featured in the Europa League and Carabao Cup so far this campaign. De Gea joins Pogba and Jesse Lingard on the sidelines, with Solskjaer confirming the pair have “no chance” of being fit. The United boss added: “Paul had an injury, he came back, he worked really hard. He came back and played a couple of games, maybe played through the pain barrier. “He had a scan after the Arsenal game and maybe needed a few weeks’ rest in a boot so hopefully he won’t be too long, but he won’t make this game, no.” United have won just two of their opening eight league games and sit just two points above the drop zone in 12th place.
