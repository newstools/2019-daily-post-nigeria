Kidnappers of Kaduna State Engravers College female students and their staff on Monday insisted on payment of N10m each on kidnapped six students and two staff of school. DAILY POST recalls that, some gunmen in the early hours of Thursday last week stormed the Engravers College and whisked away six female students and two other staff resident in the school to an unknown destination. The spokesman for the Kaduna State Police Command, DSP Yakubu Sabo, who confirmed the incident said, “On Friday, the kidnappers were said to have contacted the management of the college where they demanded N50m as ransom after jettisoning their earlier demand of N30m per head for the pupils. “The abductors later settled for N50m for the six female pupils and the two staff.” Though, there were expectations that the kidnapped victims may be released between Sunday and or early Monday, however, it was reliably gathered that wide telecast of the kidnapped victims on both radio and television annoyed the kidnappers who eventually changed their mind and increased the ransom to be paid. A source, who spoke to DAILY POST on the condition of anonymity Monday evening said, that the abductors declined on the earlier collective bargain they started. “The earlier bargain was N50m on the students and the two staff of the college. ” The abductors were furious over media reports and that the college should seek assistance from the state government on settling the ransom,” the source said He added that the abductors again called that each parent of the six female pupils should pay N10m ransom while the two staff should pay the same amount, bringing the total amount to N80 million.
