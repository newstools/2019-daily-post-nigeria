The House of Representatives Committee on Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring (NCDM) has been mandated to monitor compliance with President Muhammadu Buhari’s Executive order putting restriction on employment of foreigners for jobs where Nigerians have the skills.
President Buhari in February, 2019 issued Executive order 5 which prohibits the Ministry of Interior from issuing visas to foreign nationals whose skills are readily available in Nigeria. The Chairman of the Committee, Lego Idagbo (Cross River) made this known at the inaugural meeting of the committee. Idagbo in his remark noted that the jurisdiction of the committee was changed in the 8th Assembly to monitor compliance with the directive by the President. “The President, pursuant to the authority vested on him by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria(as amended), ordered that all “procuring entities shall give preference to Nigerian companies and firms in .the award of contracts in ,line with the Public, Procurement Act, 2007”. He added that, “The President therefore directed MiniStries, Departments and Agencies to engage indigenous professional in the planning, design and execution of national security projects. “Consequent on the above, the House has reviewed the jurisdiction of the Committee to accommodate the details of the Presidential Executive Order; and the name of the Committee has been changed from “LOCAL CONTENT” to “NIGERIAN CONTENT DEVELOPMENT AND MONITORING” (NCDM).” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
