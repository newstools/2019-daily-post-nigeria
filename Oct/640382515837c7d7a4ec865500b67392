Tottenham Hotspur manager, Mauricio Pochettino has said that he could be sacked if the club continue in their recent poor form. The Argentine, however, said he tries not to pay too much attention to speculation over his future. Tottenham have made a poor start to the season recording only three wins in nine Premier League games so far. They head into Tuesday’s Champions League match against Red Star Belgrade at the bottom of Group B. Spurs were held to a 1-1 draw by bottom-of-the-table Watford in the Premier League at the weekend. “Our performance is not as good as we can deliver,” Reuters quotes Pochettino. “Of course we need to improve. On the other side there are all of the rumours that happen at any club when you don’t win but it doesn’t mean they’re true. “I understand this business. I’m 47 – why do you think I don’t have grey hair? Because I don’t pay attention to any of this. I only pay attention that we need to improve our performances. “If we don’t improve our performance, what is going to be the result? It’s always the same in football and you are thinking the same as me.” Pochettino led the north London side to the Champions League final last season, where they lost to Liverpool, but said he was not surprised by his position being called into question after a few poor games. “That is football, I’m not surprised. It’s normal,” Pochettino added. “Football is always about winning today and tomorrow. What happens yesterday is gone and we apply this philosophy here. “You need to think about winning today and tomorrow… If I think too much ahead and I don’t win, then these rumours don’t surprise me.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
