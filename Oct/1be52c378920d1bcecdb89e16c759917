Former Chelsea manager, Jose Mourinho, has said Liverpool have “limitations against teams with low blocks”, after their 1-1 draw with Manchester United on Sunday at Old Trafford. The Reds dropped points for the first time in the Premier League this season, after Adam Lallana cancelled out Marcus Rashford’s goal. United had the better of the match in the first half and looked set to hand the Reds their first defeat of the league season, before Lallana rose from the bench to secure a point. Liverpool have not won at Old Trafford since 2014 and manager Jurgen Klopp explained after the match, how his team find it difficult because United simply want to defend against them. Mourinho agreed with this assessment, describing United’s defensive outlook as a “low block” and saying Liverpool’s failure to break it down is a major weakness. ‘ “Their quality as a team to play against a low block, which is a problem that sometimes they have,” Mourinho said on Sky Sports. “They have these fantastic records of all these victories, but they have some limitations against teams with low blocks. “Jurgen clearly has a little bit of frustration, they are a fantastic team, but at Old Trafford, a special place for Liverpool to win, he never did it.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
