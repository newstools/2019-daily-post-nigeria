Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has confirmed that he has “received some interesting proposals” to return to football. Wenger stepped out of the spotlight in May 2018, when he left the Emirates, after 21 years in charge of the Gunners. Since that time, the Frenchman has mostly done punditry work but has been linked with several clubs. Speaking as he received the 2019 Legends of Football award at a dinner in London on Monday that benefits music therapy charity Nordoff Robbins, he said: “Since leaving Arsenal I have received some interesting proposals some of which I am currently contemplating. “However, one invitation that I did not hesitate to accept, and I am extremely honoured to do so, is to receive the 2019 Legends of Football award.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
