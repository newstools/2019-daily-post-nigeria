Human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), has reacted to the resignation of former presidential candidate of Young Progressives Party, YPP, Kingsley Moghalu, from his party. DAILY POST had reported that Moghalu on Monday announced his resignation on his official Twitter handle. He said the need to push for electoral reforms ahead of 2023 general elections informed his decision to quit partisan politics. He had said “Without electoral reform, which includes electronic voting, our democracy will remain weak. Let’s fix this before 2023. Reacting, however Falana accused Moghalu of resigning because he was given an appointment by the ruling party, APC. Speaking at the 2019 Felabration symposium held at the NECA HOUSE, Lagos State, Falana was quoted as saying, “Is Dr. Moghalu still around? I think it is unfair to single out Dr. Moghalu for recognition. “We should not celebrate opportunism. Here is a politician who contested on the platform of a party, who has moved conveniently to the APC. “They’ve just given him an appointment and he has just discarded his own political party. I don’t think that is fair for all.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
