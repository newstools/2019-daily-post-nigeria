Manchester United manager and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s former coach, Ole Olsen, has urged the Red Devils to give the Norwegian more time to build his team at Old Trafford. Olsen, who gave Solskjaer his debut for Clausenengen aged 17, claimed the current players the Norwegian inherited at the club from former Man United boss, Jose Mourinho have not been good enough. According to him, Solskjaer has been unlucky with injuries from Man United players this season. “You might think he’s quiet but he burns inside if he’s not happy. He’s a football addict,” Ole told The Athletic . “Now he’s under pressure I feel pity for him. He deserves support and he deserves time to build a team. “This Manchester United team isn’t his. He handled it well in the beginning, but he’s been unlucky too, with injured players and with his players not scoring chances. “They have not been good enough either, but it’s difficult to play against teams who lie in their own box. “Liverpool and Man City can open teams up, United isn’t good enough yet. They are meeting a wall 60 metres from goal and United don’t have the service from someone like (Kevin) De Bruyne to create. “You have to be accurate to open up opponents, but United need better players too and they can’t buy any until 2020.” Solskjaer’s men will take on Newcastle United this weekend in the Premier League after playing a goalless draw with AZ Alkmaar in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday.
