Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, on expressed worry over the closure of the Nigeria – Benin border by the federal government. According to him, the closure of the border was suspicious as it bears huge implications on the economies of Lagos and the southwest. Speaking on Thursday during the 2019 edition of the Olokun Festival in Badagry, Adams lamented that the closure of the border will definitely affect the people in the south than any other region He said: “It is unfortunate that the Nigeria – Benin border had to be shut, however, the closure seems suspicious to me because the borders in the North still operate conveniently without anybody blinking an eye. “This portends grave danger to us as a people because the economic implications of the border closure will largely affect us more in the southwest than any other regions.” He, however, urged the Federal government, to as a matter of urgency, re-open the border and make sure that the necessary arrangements are made to forestall illegal smuggling of rice and other valuables into the country. ”We can reduce the unlawful smuggling of rice and other items into the country. It involves proper planning and documentation from the Nigerian government and the officials, including the Immigrations and the Customs must be up and doing in ensuring that the law is effective,” he said. Iba Gani Adams also appealed to the southwest governors to join him in projecting the cultural identity of the Yoruba race to the world.
