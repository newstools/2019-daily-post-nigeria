Tijani Babangida, former Super Eagles winger, has commended the Super Eagles over their 1-1 draw with the Samba Boys of Brazil on Sunday. Babangida expressed satisfaction with the performance of the Super Eagles in the draw with the star-studded Samba Boys of Brazil in Singapore. Super Eagles had yesterday drew their match with the Selecao after Real Madrid Star Casemiro cancelled out Joel Aribo’s 34th minute goal. However, Babangida said the Super Eagles deserved commendation because they were made up of young players who were able to hold the highly experienced Brazilian side to a draw. The former winger said such high profile friendly matches would help expose the young players of the Super Eagles. Speaking to Daily Trust, the former Ajax of Holland winger said: “It is a good result for the Super Eagles. In such friendly matches, we shouldn’t look so much at the result but the performance of the players. “The result against Brazil is therefore a welcome development because the boys gave a very good account of themselves. They have shown that the glory days will soon be back. “The future is looking good with these youngsters. My happiness is that at least 80% of the present squad is made up of very young players who are going to last long in the Super Eagles. “More of such matches will be good for the young boys. They need more experience which can be attained only through such friendly matches. “They should be given more exposure. The future is indeed bright for the Super Eagles.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
