Massimiliano Allegri will ask for Patrice Evra to join his coaching staff, if he replaces Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as Manchester United manager, according to MailOline. Solskjaer is already under huge pressure, following his side’s slow start to the season. Allegri is believed to be on United’s shortlist of candidates if the club decide to fire the Norwegian. The report claims that Allegri has “promised” Evra a place as a first-team coach if he becomes United’s next manager. Last month, Evra returned to United as a youth coach while he continues to work on his UEFA coaching badges. Evra, who retired in July, already has experience of working under Allegri, having played under the Italian at Juventus. Allegri would also want to bring Marco Landucci, his assistant at Juve, with him to United along with Evra.
