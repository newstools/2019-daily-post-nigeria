The Secretary of the Zamfara State wing of the All Progressives Congress, (APC), Alhaji Sani Musa Mafara has urged members of the party to embrace the peace accord and reconciliation process initiated by the state government being led by Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle. Briefing newsmen on Saturday at Talata-Mafara residence of the former governor of the State, the APC scribe noted that the peace accord and reconciliation process was for the good of the party , saying that there would not be any development without peace. He stated that his party was not against any thing obstructing peace in the state. ” We are in support of peace in the state contrary to the believe of the ruling party in the state. This is because we are out for the peaceful coexistence of the State. “If we continue to fix many blames on every administration of the state, the state would not move forward considering the global changes we are witnessing today,” he lamented. ” The PDP-led government should not think that we are against its programs and policies as being speculated by its numerous members in the state.” “We believe that God has given them the power to oversee the affairs of this state, so we cannot join issues with them as being speculated by their ignorant members in the State.” “We don’t want any of our party members to engage in any act capable of undermining the security arrangement put in place by the present administration. Let us support the peace initiative,” he said. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
