Arsenal playmaker, Mesut Ozil, has said the team can take a number of positives from their painful Carabao Cup defeat to Liverpool at Anfield. Unai Emery’s side led the Premier League leaders 2-1 and 4-2 on Wednesday evening, but the game finished 5-5 after 90 minutes. Divock Origi’s 94th-minute acrobatic goal sent the tie to penalties and Liverpool goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher saved Dani Ceballos’ effort to clinch a 5-4 shootout win. Ozil made only his third appearance of the season for the gunners during the match and played a key role in two of Arsenal’s goals. The German was surprisingly subbed off by Emery in the 65th minute and has taken to Instagram to react to the result. He wrote: “Crazy and incredible match. Losing on penalties is always tough, but definitely some positive things to take away from Anfield Road tonight. “Thanks for the away support! Focus on Wolverhampton now.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
