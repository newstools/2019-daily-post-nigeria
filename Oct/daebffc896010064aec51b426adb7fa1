The Director-General of the Governor Yahaya Bello Campaign Organization, Sen. Smart Adeyemi, has said it’s too late for Atiku Abubakar, ex-Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate to resolve the crisis in Kogi State chapter of the party. Following the recently conducted PDP primaries in the state, some aspirants who lost have been bickering over the outcome of the exercise, which saw Musa Wada emerge as the party’s flag bearer in the upcoming governorship election in the state. Against this backdrop, Atiku had been meeting with interested parties with the aim of resolving the crisis, ahead of the election. However, Adeyemi cautioned Atiku against trying to resolve the crisis because it’s beyond redemption. Addressing journalists in Abuja yesterday, the campaign Director-General urged the former Vice President not to waste his time trying to resolve the crisis. He said: “My advice to Alhaji Atiku Abubakar is that he should not waste his time and money. It is too late. I wish he did that six months ago. “The crisis rocking the Kogi PDP are fundamental. They are without planning, they are without focus and people have made up their minds in Kogi State. “How can you present the son-in-law of a former governor who is also the younger brother of another former governor. Even if you are picking someone from the same zone, are there not other very competent persons from the zone?” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
