Chelsea defender, Fikayo Tomori, has admitted difficulty in choosing the country to represent at the international level. Tomori was handed his debut England call-up, for their Euro 2020 qualifiers against Czech Republic and Bulgaria earlier this month. Before his selection into the Three Lions’ fold, the 21-year-old was eligible to play for his county of birth, Canada or Nigeria through his parents. Although he is yet to make his debut appearance for England, Tomori said he never received an invitation from the Super Eagles before joining Gareth Southgate’s team. “I just wanted to go as far as I can and that also involves playing for the national team. “It was a difficult choice for me. It was something I had to think about for a year or two and I was previously at the U21 Euros, so I wasn’t thinking too far ahead, but then there was a lot of talk and questions and I had to make a decision. “England called me up in September, and I didn’t get a call up from anyone when they called me up, it was hard to say no to them,” Tomori told OmaSportsTV Despite his international commitment to the Three Lions, the former Derby County and Hull City defender affirmed that he is still Nigerian and also confessed his love for the country’s delicacies. “But I enjoy Nigerian music, I’m Nigerian, it’s my culture and I’m very proud of it. I enjoy the food too – pounded yam and jollof especially,” he added. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
