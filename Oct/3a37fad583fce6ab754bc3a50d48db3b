Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has claimed that the club tried to sign Fabinho, before he moved to Liverpool. Fabinho completed a £53m move to Anfield from Monaco in the summer of 2018 and endured a slow start to life on Merseyside. The Brazilian’s form picked up in the second half of last season and he played a key role in Liverpool’s Champions League success. Fabinho is now one of Jurgen Klopp’s first picks and Emery believes Arsenal’s new signings Nicolas Pepe and Dani Ceballos could enjoy a similar turnaround. Ahead of his side’s clash with Vitoria in the Europa League, Emery told reporters: “I love Fabinho. His name was on the table, but he signed for Liverpool. “The first six months he didn’t play, he was adapting – but now he is amazing. “I want the same patience with Dani Ceballos, with Nicolas Pepe.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
