The All Progressives Congress (APC) Governors under the auspices of Progressives Governors’ Forum (PGF), have slammed those criticizing President Muhammadu Buhari’s two weeks private trip to London, UK. Governor of Lagos state, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, fielding questions after the meeting between the governors and State Commissioners for Information of all the APC states, stated that the visit should be the least of the worries for Nigerians. Sanwo-Olu represented by the his Deputy, Kadri Hamzat, urged Nigerians to realise the fact that Buhari is a human being. “First of all, I think we should understand one thing that Mr. President is a human being and part of the problems we have is that we place our leaders as if they are super human when they are human being. “They have legs, they have pains. For instance, I was in pains at my back after flying from Lagos to Abuja, does it mean I cannot go through pains as a human being? So, Mr. President is a human being, he has wife, he has children, he has brothers and sisters and he also has personal needs. “That you are the President does not mean that you should not be a human being. Part of the problems is that as a people we try to elevate our leaders as if they are not human being, they are. The moment we understand that, we will be able to manage our thoughts and actions. “Mr. President went for a conference in Saudi Arabia and he wants to visit London on a private visit, he is a human being. May be he wants to see his cousin. “Does it mean that if you are in office your family should go and perish? No. For me, I don’t think we should worry about the visit and such things, they are mundane issues. We should rather look at policies and what he is doing to affect the lives of citizens of this country,” he said.
