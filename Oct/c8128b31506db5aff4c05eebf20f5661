Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has admitted he failed to warn his players about being caught on the counter-attack, before Matty Longstaff scored Newcastle’s winner on Sunday. Solskjaer was seen trying to get Scott McTominay and Fred’s attention in the second half of the Premier League clash, before issuing instructions to Andreas Pereira on the touchline. Newcastle would eventually punish United on the counter-attack and the Norwegian confirmed his fears came true. “We weren’t set up for the counter-attack. “We conceded at least two goals – Everton away Wolves away – from our own corners, maybe two against Everton in one game. “And that shouldn’t happen and with the pace we’ve got, we should lock that corner down. “But it’s impossible to get the message across, because we gave the Newcastle fans something to cheer today, we gave them a game that they wanted, end-to-end at times. “We gave them too many counter-attacks, lifted their crowd, you could see they were behind their team, behind [Steve] Brucey and it was impossible for me to put one or two players where they should have been. “There are players that try to organise it but couldn’t and when that happens, six or seven back in our own box, but we couldn’t defend that ball. “There were two attempts to tackle, from Dan [James] and Fred. We’re trying but lacking in that composure and that organiser there,” Solskjaer told reporters at St James Park Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
