A Federal Capital Territory, FCT High Court sitting in Abuja has sentenced Akeem Oluwafemi Akanni to one-month imprisonment with an option of N20, 000 fine over impersonation and deceit to obtain money by false pretence. Akanni, it was gathered, met his waterloo when he falsely presented himself as an officer of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, to Abdullahi Idris, a staff of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, Kaduna. The anti-graft spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren said this in a statement in Abuja. He explained, “Early this year the convict, while posing as an EFCC officer, attempted to obtain a sum of N300,000 (Three Hundred Thousand Naira) from Idris ostensibly to assist him “KILL A CASE FILED AGAINST HIM”, an action which contravenes Section 95 of the Penal Code, laws of the Federation of Nigeria (Abuja) 1990 and punishable under Section 322 of the same law. “The defendant pleaded guilty after the charges were read to him”. Presiding Justice I.O. Musa, therefore, in his judgment, sentenced him to one-month imprisonment with an option of fine based on the plea bargain agreement between the parties.
