Manchester United goalkeeper, David De Gea, has expressed his anger, as they suffered their third defeat of the season at Newcastle United on Sunday. The Red Devils suffered a 1-0 loss, thanks to Matthew Longstaff’s 72nd goal at St James Park. The result leaves Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men in 12th place, two points above relegation places. “It is not acceptable, not just this game but the whole season. It is the most difficult time since I have been here. “I don’t know what is happening. We cannot even score one goal in two games,” De Gea told BBC after the match.
