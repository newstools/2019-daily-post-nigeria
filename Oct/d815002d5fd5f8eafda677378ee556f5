Coach of the senior national team of Brazil Tite has noted that the five-time world champions always find it difficult when they face African team. He said this is because the African teams are stronger and more physical. In Brazil’s friendly game against Senegal, on Thursday, Liverpool’s Roberto Firmino opened the scoring in the ninth minute but Famara Diedhiou scored from the spot to equalise for the Teranga Lions. Speaking at the post-match press conference, Tite admitted that Brazil played below expectations and noted it was hard to beat Cameroon in a friendly last November. ”From my time here, it’s the second time we’ve played against the African countries, and it’s the second time we’ve had difficulty. “It was like this against Cameroon too,” Tite was quoted as saying by TV Globo. ”They are teams that seek contact, bring compaction, strong aerial ball. And we are still finding the best way to play against the African teams.” The Samba Boys will face another African team, Nigeria in their next friendly at the National Stadium in Singapore on Sunday.
