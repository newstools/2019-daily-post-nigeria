Former Liverpool and Manchester United striker, Michael Owen, has backed Arsenal to secure a top-four finish in the Premier League this season. The Gunners are currently fourth in the top-flight, having lost just one of their opening seven league games. “I think Arsenal are the most consistent team that you can wish for in a way because they always beat the teams that you expect them to beat. “Sheffield United away, that’s tricky for them, they’re not a good away team. In the Europa League I think they will win virtually every game, their group is weak and they blow teams away. “Of course you’ve got the likes of Liverpool [in the cup] coming up and Wolves, which will be tricky for them. “But every other team, that’s a great run for them now and I expect them to have a good season. “It’s the first time in a long while I’ve looked at Arsenal and though “do you know what? It is a top-four team now, it’s got a chance of being in the top four”. “Partly because Manchester United are slipping away, but I’ve always seen Arsenal as sort of fifth and sixth and just a nearly-team for the last decade. “Actually, I look at them now and think do you know what? [They can finish in] the top four,” Owen told BT Sport. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
