The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr Boss Mustapha, has said the Federal Government would ensure that Nollywood actors get a fair deal from their trade. Mustapha stated this at the grand finale of a stage play produced by 30-year-old Patrick Otoro, on Saturday in Abuja
According to him, the proprietary rights of Nollywood actors needed to be protected by the government so that they can derive maximum return from their artistic endeavours.
“One of the things that government has to do is to make sure that their rights are protected because that is why they loose a lot of money. There are a lot of leakages in the process in terms of people pirating their products. ”Nollywood in the African continent and even in the world is thriving and big industry. But the actors and actresses, do they receive commiserate benefit from the kind of work they do? “They are not getting value for their output. They train very hard, they perform very well but at the end of the day, what gets to them is peanuts. “The industry will have to restructure itself in such a way that there will be capable and competent managers that will manage their artists. All of these must be put in place so that whenever talent is exhibited, it will be protected,” NAN quoted him as saying.
