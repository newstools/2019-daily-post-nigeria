Michael Ballack has become the latest of Frank Lampard’s former Chelsea team-mate to be called on for advice by the Blues’ boss. The former Germany captain shared images of his visit to the Cobham training ground on Instagram on Saturday. Ballack oversaw training and had a meeting with Lampard and his technical adviser, Petr Cech. Cech and the two midfielders shared the Stamford Bridge dressing room for four years, winning the 2009/2010 Premier League title and reaching the Champions League final together. Lampard is preparing his side for a league fixure at Southampton on Sunday. They currently sit in ninth place.
