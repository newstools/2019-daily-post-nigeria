Luis Campos, a former assistant to ex-Manchester United and Chelsea boss, Jose Mourinho, has said that the Portuguese boss is likely to return to Real Madrid. Mourinho has not had a job in management since being sacked by the Red Devils in December 2018. Campos insists it won’t be long before Mourinho would return to Bernabeu. Campos told El Chiringuito de Jugones, “Real Madrid are a good thing. Jose Mourinho is a good thing. When we mix two good things together you get better results. “Real Madrid needs to have the best managers and Mourinho’s CV gives him the right to work in the best clubs.” Campos also reckons Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe will follow Mourinho to Spain. He added, “I think he will end up at Real Madrid. “If he wants to be the best player in the world, he has to play for Real Madrid.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
