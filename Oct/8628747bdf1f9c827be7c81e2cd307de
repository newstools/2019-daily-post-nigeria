Liverpool ace, Sadio Mane has again repudiated talks of a ‘rift’ with fellow teammate, Mohamed Salah, after he was seen to be visibly angry with the Egyptian international during the Reds’ 3-0 win over Burnley in the Premier League some weeks ago. DAILY POST recalls that Mane recently insisted he was not best pleased with Salah after he ignored a pass to him against Burnley in the Premier League. The Senegal international was taken off for Divock Origi, shortly after failing to receive a pass from Salah when the score was 3-0. When he was taken off, Mane could be seen walking past manager, Jurgen Klopp and shouting at a member of Liverpool’s staff on the bench. He was then comforted by fellow goalscorer Roberto Firmino, who had also just been replaced. “These things happen in football,” Mane was quoted by ESPN as saying in a news conference on Tuesday ahead of Liverpool’s UEFA Champions League clash against Red Bull on Wednesday night at Anfield. “I was a little bit frustrated. “You want to score more goals. We can see Man City’s 8-0.” “But it can happen. Salah didn’t see me. We’re really good friends.” Meanwhile, Salah has already made up with Mane and both players agreed to forget about it.
