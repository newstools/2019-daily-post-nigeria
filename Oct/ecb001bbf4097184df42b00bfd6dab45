Four men suspected to be kidnappers on Tuesday were killed during a gun dwell with operatives of the Edo State Police Command. The suspects were said to have laid an ambush for the security operatives before they met their waterloo. It was gathered that two suspected kidnappers who were earlier arrested by the police through electronic monitoring of their activities, were leading some detectives to their armoury, located in a bush after Ogba River after Benin airport in the outskirts of the city. Unknown to the police detectives, some members of the gang had laid an ambush in wait of them. Quick response from the police operatives resulted in the killing of four of the kidnappers, while others who were said to be on standby in a boat fled into the river. The State Commissioner of Police, CP. DanMallam Muhammed, who confirmed the report, said it would have been a tragedy if his men were not alert when the ugly incident happened. According to him, “It is not a case of gunning down the kidnappers, the police officers were ambushed but our men were at alert and responded quickly and swiftly and killed four of the kidnappers in the course of the attack while others escaped with gunshot injuries. “Our men were ready, otherwise it would have been a different story on our part.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
