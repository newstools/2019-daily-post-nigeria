Former Premier League manager, David Moyes is set to return as Everton coach following the Toffees’ Premier League 1-0 defeat to Burnley last weekend. According to Mirror UK, Moyes has emerged favourite ahead of Mikel Arteta and Rafa Benitez to replace current manager, Marco Silva. Silva is currently under pressure at Goodison Park due to the club’s poor form this season. Silva’s men are currently sitting in the 18th position in the Premier League table with seven points from eight matches. Moyes spent eleven years at Everton, helping them to regularly finish in the Premier League top eight. The former Manchester United coach has since turned down offers of jobs in the Championship and League One in the past few weeks to wait for the right opportunity.
