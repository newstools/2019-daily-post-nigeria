Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has told Nicolas Pepe, not to put himself under too much pressure. The 24-year-old has struggled to make an impact, since his £72 million move from Lille in the summer. Emery insists Pepe needs time to adapt and has refused to put the winger under pressure because of his price tag. “The players are not thinking about the salary or what one club paid to use him. “For us, it’s not thinking about pressure or not pressure. “We are playing every time, as a coach or a player, under pressure. Under pressure is a positive. Being under pressure is because we are at a big club with a very demanding objective. “The players are here because they deserve to be and they are privileged to be here. “That privilege brings pressure, of course. But it’s positive. “Not for the salary, not for how much the club paid for him. No, no, no. It’s because we need to achieve a good performance, individually and collectively. We need to be very demanding of ourselves, but it’s positive. “I am sure that Pepe is an amazing player. “A lot of players when they came here, the first month, the first year is not easy for them. “But I am going to work with him, to make it easier for Pepe and Dani Ceballos and other players, and carry on, being together and be strong,” Emery told reporters, ahead of Thursday’s Europa League clash against Standard Liege.
