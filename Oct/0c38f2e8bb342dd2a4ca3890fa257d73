The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari on the Supreme Court’s ruling that dismissed the appeals filed by the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar on Wednesday. MURIC described the decision of the apex court as a confirmation of the wish of the Nigerian people. The Supreme Court on Wednesday declared President Muhammadu Buhari the authentic winner of the 2019 presidential election, dismissing the appeal of Atiku in which he sought to upturn the validation of the results of the February 2019 elections by the presidential election tribunal. The Supreme Court ruling was unanimous as the seven-man panel led by the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad picked holes in Atiku’s petition. MURIC’s statement signed by Professor Ishaq Akintola, its Director, said, “We congratulate President Muhammadu Buhari for this well-deserved victory. In the same vein, we felicitate with the Chairman of the ruling party, Comrade Adams Oshiomole and the party’s National Leader, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “This is the General Will, the wish of the Nigerian people. We charge the triumphant party to be magnanimous in victory, to remain focused on its anti-corruption agenda and to work tirelessly towards making life more abundant in Nigeria. We urge the opposition to join hands with President Muhammadu Buhari in moving the nation forward. “MURIC hails the Supreme Court for a speedy legal process and for removing all unnecessary procrastination technicalities which had often slowed down judicial processes. We remind the CJN that Nigerians are anxiously awaiting the reform of the judiciary. He should therefore expedite action in this regard.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
