President Muhammadu Buhari has greeted former Nigeria’s Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Staff, Lt. Gen. Ipoola Alani Akinrinade, on his 80th birthday. A statement on Thursday by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, saluted his steadfastness, courage and unwavering patriotism to serve the country. “President Buhari joins family members, friends and all professional colleagues in celebrating the gallant military officer who steadily grew in his career, reaching the peak at a young age and consistently projected virtues, that endeared him to many at local and international levels”, it read. “The President affirms that Lt. Gen. Akinrinade rose to the occasion at crucial moments in the nation’s history, accepting to serve after retirement as Minister of Agriculture, Water Resources and Rural Development, Minister of Industries and Minister of Transport, leaving behind strong legacies of visionary leadership. “President Buhari extols the courage and forthrightness of the former minister in standing for the truth at all times, and putting the interest of the nation first, which saw him fighting for the country’s return to democracy with the National Democratic Coalition, and working with governments and institutions to entrench democratic culture and values. “As the former minister and elder statesman turns 80, the President acknowledges his contribution to his initial constituency, military, and the nation, praying that the almighty God will grant him longer life and good health to keep sharing his experience and wisdom.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
