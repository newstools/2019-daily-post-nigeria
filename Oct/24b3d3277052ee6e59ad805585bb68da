Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard has expressed happiness after England handed Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori international call-ups. DAILY POST reports that England manager, Gareth Southgate, has called up Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori, for their Euro 2020 qualifying games against Czech Republic and Bulgaria. Abraham and Tomori, who are also eligible to play for Nigeria, have been in impressive form for the Blues this season. If they accept the invitation and eventually feature in any of the matches, they will not be able to represent the Super Eagles again. “I’m delighted Tammy Abraham is back in the England squad. He has all the attributes to go there and be successful,” Lampard told reporters at his pre-match press conference on Friday ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash against Southampton on Sunday. “It will be another step for him and a good challenge for Tammy.” Lampard added: “Fikayo Tomori deserves it. He has been a dream to work with day in, day out for the last 15 months or so. “It’s a great step up and it’s in his hands to go there and show what he shows us every day.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
