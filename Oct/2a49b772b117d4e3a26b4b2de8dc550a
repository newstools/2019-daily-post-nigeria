Former Manchester United midfielder, Marouane Fellaini, has disclosed that the club made a big mistake by sacking their erstwhile manager, Jose Mourinho. Manchester United sacked Mourinho last December and replaced him with current boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. But Fellaini now believes that the Red Devils were too quick to sack Mourinho, adding that the Portuguese wanted to build a team for the club. “Mourinho, for the first season, he did amazingly, he improved the team, won things. OK, the second season, was a bit more difficult but he tried, you know, and did his best to help the team. Then they decided to sack him and that’s football,” Fellaini was quoted by Mirror UK as saying. “For me, yes (they were too quick to sack him) because a manager like that comes and he needs a lot of players to do his own philosophy. He wanted to build his team and after two and a half years they decided to sack him because the results were not there. “They brought in one of the best managers in the world in Jose Mourinho, he wanted to build a team and they sacked him. It’s not easy to build a team in that time, you need more than two years. “I don’t know what they will do with this manager (Solskjaer)) but, for me, to win things and to improve, you need time. That’s the problem with the coach and the direction, they have to find a solution together. “Now you have a new manager, they wanted young players and that’s what happens when you play with just young players. They will be up and down, up and down, that’s football. “Of course in football, you can’t play with just young players, you need a mix. To win games, to win titles, to win big games you need experience. Of course you can win with young players but not every game.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
