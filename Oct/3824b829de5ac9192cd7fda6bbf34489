The FCT Minister of State, Dr Ramatu Aliyu, has commended the emergence of Chief Edward Onoja, as Deputy Governor of Kogi State, following the impeachment of Mr. Simon Achuba by the State Assembly. DAILY POST recalls that a seven-member panel of inquiry was set up by the Kogi State Chief Judge, Justice Nasir Ajanah, on Aug. 26 to investigate allegations of gross misconduct against the deputy governor, Mr Simon Achuba. Chairman of the panel, Mr John Baiyeshea, submitted the report to the Speaker, Kogi House of Assembly, Mr Matthew Kolawole, at plenary, which led to the impeachment of the former deputy governor. Onoja was, however, sworn in on Saturday as the new Deputy Governor of the state despite the fact that the panel’s report didn’t find Achuba guilty of the allegations. Reacting, Aliyu in a statement issued by her Special Assistant on Media, Mr Austine Elemue, on Sunday, described the choice of Onoja as a perfect political combination for the state and the ruling All Progressives Party (APC) in the Nov. 16 governorship election. Aliyu also described the relationship between Gov. Yahaya Bello and Onoja as trustworthy and cordial, noting that their relationship predates the emergence of Bello in 2016. “Onoja has been an ally of the governor for long as their relationship goes way back. A friend is someone difficult to find and someone you can always count on when times are tough. “A friend understands that you may not always get along, but you should always try and be there for them and look out for them,” NAN quoted her as saying.
