Former Minister of Education, Oby Ezekwesili, has reacted to the viral video of the University of Lagos (UNILAG) lecturer caught on camera demanding sex from a female student “seeking admission.” DAILY POST reports that the lecturer, Boniface Igbeneghu, is a former sub-dean of Faculty of Art and head pastor of local Foursquare Gospel Church. His advances were captured in a 13-minute video by BBC Africa. The undercover journalist, Kiki Mordi, disguised as a 17-year-old admission seeker. Igbeneghu disclosed that there is a place lecturers take female students to have fun – UNILAG Staff Club. “They call the place cold room,” he added. Igbeneghu, at the first meeting, was quoted as saying, “Don’t you know you are a beautiful girl? Do you know I am a pastor and I am in my 50s but if I want a girl of 17 years, all I need is a sweet tongue and put some money”? At the second meeting, he prayed with the journalist and later asked: “What age do you start knowing men. Be assured that your mother will not hear.” Reacting to the allegation, Ezekwesili wrote on Twitter: “I thank you @kikimordi for that ground-breaking piece of incisive investigative work with @BBCAfrica Eye. “We should push for the findings to be acted on swiftly and decisively. We must curb the menace that corrodes our society across the board, not just educational institutions.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
