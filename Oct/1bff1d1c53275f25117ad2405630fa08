Former aide to President Muhammadu Buhari and APC candidate for the Enugu West Senatorial election, Mrs Juliet Ibekaku Nwagwu has reacted to the Court of Appeal’s ruling, which affirmed the election of Sen. Ike Ekweremadu of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Tuesday. DAILY POST reports that in a unanimous judgment delivered by the panel chaired by Justice I.M. Salawu, the court dismissed the appeal filed by Mrs Juliet Ibekaku-Nwagwu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for lacking in merit. The court held that the appellants failed to prove allegations of non-compliance to the Electoral Act and as such were not entitled to the reliefs sought. Reacting to the judgement, Nwagwu, while accepting the verdict of the court, thanked her supporters for their loyalty and faith in her. “In every situation, we give thanks to the Almighty God and as law abiding citizens and good sportsmen, we have accepted the verdict of the Appeal Court. “We will all go back to the trenches because the senatorial seat of Enugu West will come to the APC in 2023,” she said. Ibekaku-Nwagwu added that she would, henceforth, dedicate her time to assisting the Attorney General of the Federation in his ongoing judicial reforms to ensure that President Muhammadu Buhari succeeded. “With my recent appointment as the Special Assistant to the President on Justice Reform and International Relations, my preoccupation now is to help President Muhammadu Buhari to succeed. “What Mr President needs now is not distraction but necessary support that would make him succeed,” NAN quoted her as saying.
