Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi has hailed fellow teammate, Antoine Griezmann as one of the best players in the world. Messi, who recently said he does not have any problem with Griezmann, despite the Frenchman claiming they were yet to connect, noted that the forward is a very intelligent player with a lot of quality. Griezmann joined Barcelona from Atletico Madrid in last summer transfer window. Speaking in an interview with Catalan radio station, RAC1, Messi said: “It isn’t easy to play FC Barcelona because of our philosophy. “Griezmann is accustomed to another style. “He’s a very intelligent player with a lot of quality. He will adapt, and Griezmann is welcome. He’s one of the best.” Griezmann has scored three goals for Barcelona so far this season.
