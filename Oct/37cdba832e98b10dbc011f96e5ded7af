Gerard Pique has insisted that his Barcelona team mates, Lionel Messi and Antoine Griezmann, have a perfectly normal relationship. Earlier this month, Griezmann revealed he found it “difficult” to connect with Messi, as neither of them are naturally big talkers. It had been rumoured that the Argentine, who hoped for Neymar’s return, objected to the club’s pursuit of Griezmann. Messi has since branded that a “lie” and insisted he has no problem with Griezmann, a claim now supported by Pique. “Here, we magnify everything very much. “Leo and Grizi get along, the same as Leo and [Ousmane] Dembele get along, or Leo with Pedro or [David] Villa. It’s good. With Luis [Suarez and Messi], they are almost like brothers. “Just because he doesn’t get along [with Griezmann] like he does with Luis doesn’t mean they get along badly,” Pique told Cadena SER.
