Juventus superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo has hailed Maurizio Sarri’s men for their ‘team work’ following the Old Lady’s UEFA Champions League 2-1 win over Lokomotiv Moscow on Tuesday night in Turin. Ronaldo also urged his teammates to keep believing in themselves as they aim to win this season’s Champions League. Paulo Dybala was surprisingly preferred to Gonzalo Higuain in Juventus attacking lineup. In spite of enjoying 69 per cent possession over 90 minutes, Juventus trailed to Aleksei Miranchuk’s first-half goal and appeared to be heading for their first defeat under coach Maurizio Sarri until Dybala curled in an exquisite goal in the 77th minute. The Argentine, who has started only five of Juve’s 11 matches this season, then pounced to drive home a rebound and give his side a 2-1 win which kept them level with Atletico Madrid on seven points at the top of the Group D. “Team work! Believing until the end! #finoallafine #forzajuve,” Ronaldo posted on Instagram alongside picture of his teammates celebrating. Ronaldo will now hope to lead Juventus to victory when they take on Lecce in Serie A fixture this weekend.
