Former presidential candidate of Young Progressives Party, YPP, Kingsley Moghalu, has resigned from the party. He disclosed this on Monday via his official Twitter handle. According to him, the need to push for electoral reforms ahead of 2023 general elections informed his decision to quit partisan politics. He wrote: “Without electoral reform, which includes electronic voting, our democracy will remain weak. Let’s fix this before 2023. “Partisan politics won’t fix this problem. To this end, I’ve resigned my membership of YPP. “Nigeria today is approaching its moment of reckoning. We need to focus on solving our problems at their root causes. “Electoral reform, voter education for an informed electorate, and constitutional restructuring are the real issues. If we can agree on these, all else can follow. “If we fix our elections, give our democracy real meaning, our youth will have no excuses not to vote, while they spend their money to vote on BBNaija! “Young people should lead the charge for electoral reform. With nearly 70% of Nigeria’s population, Nigeria’s future is young.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
