The Rotimi Akeredolu-led All Progressives Congress, APC government in Ondo State, has denied the claims by the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, that it was funding the election of Yahaya Bello of Kogi State. The PDP had alleged that the APC in Ondo was planning to fund the re-election bid of Governor Bello. The ruling party described the allegation as a mischievous claim in a statement by its spokesman, Alex Kalejaiye. The statement said, “For the records, the state chapter plans to set up a committee that has a clear assignment: To boost the morale of our party members in Kogi State. ”It is ridiculous for any individual or a political party, especially one that has national colouration, to allege that Ondo State chapter would build a war chest for an election holding in Kogi State, or anywhere else for that matter. “Without dispute, the APC-led government in the State harbours no space for financial recklessness. This has drawn applause from objective and sincere observers and resulted in maximising benefits of levies and taxes for the welfare of the people. ”A government that dwells in the realm of frivolity would not contemplate the on-going transformation and industrialization in Ore. “Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has repeatedly bragged about what he would do to support the PDP in Ondo. We perceive same as normal political arrogance.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
