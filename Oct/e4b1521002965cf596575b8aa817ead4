Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard has revealed why his side was defeated 2-1 by Manchester United in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night. According to Lampard, his players did not create many chances in the first half of the encounter against Man United. Two goals from Marcus Rashford ensured Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side defeated the Blues. However, Michy Batshuayi did score a goal for Lampard’s men at Stamford Bridge. Speaking after the game, Lampard told BBC Radio 5 Live: “There weren’t many chances in the first half. In the second half, we showed the energy I wanted. We created chances and dominated the game. “They got a bolt out of the blue to win the game. It’s an amazing goal, you can’t do anything about that. We felt like we were going on to win the game at that stage. “[The winning run ending was] always going to happen. You can’t go on forever. Even [Manchester] City and Liverpool lose at some point. We changed the team a lot today, made a lot of changes. I thought we were the better team in general play.”
