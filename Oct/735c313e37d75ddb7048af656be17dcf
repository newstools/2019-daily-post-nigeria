A 30-year old suspect, Lekan Jubril, has told the police that he was not sure he would ever stop stealing as he suffered from kleptomania, confessing that each time he was arrested, sentenced to prison and he came out, the drive to steal became stronger. Jubril, who was arrested by police operatives from Ejigbo Division led by the DPO, CSP Olabisi Okuwobi after involving in a robbery operation at Okoye Street Bucknor Estate, Ejigbo, said he knew he would turn out a criminal as he started smoking Indian hemp at the tender age of 10, adding that he had participated in so many criminal activities and had gone to prison three times in Lagos. The Oyo State-born Jubril said the first time he was arrested and charged to court, he spent eight months in prison but when he came out he continued stealing, saying he was caught again and sentenced to another two years imprisonment. Jubril explained that he spent only six months before he got state pardon and was released before he committed another crime, re-arrested and sent to prison where he spent two months before the latest arrest. The suspect said he had not thought of doing any other thing than to steal from people and usually operated as one-man squad in his operations. He said he landed in trouble after he joined three other members of his gang to burgle an apartment at Okoye Street, Bucknor Estate, Ejigbo, and he was eventually caught by the police. According to the police, they carted away some valuables including laptop, mobile phone and other items from the apartment before he was eventually caught by police operatives. The suspect was detained at the police station, where he confessed that he was a criminal and had sold some of the items he stole. However, the DPO of Ejigbo Police Station, CSP Olabisi Okuwobi said that Jubril would be charged to court for burglary and stealing.
