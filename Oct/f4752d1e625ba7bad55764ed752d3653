Former Super Eagles’ midfielder, Mutiu Adepoju, has said the 1-1 draw by Nigeria’s senior football team against Brazil feels like a win because of their impressive showing during the match. The Super Eagles held the five-time world champions to a stalemate in an international friendly in Singapore on Sunday. Joe Aribo had put the Super Eagles in front in the 35th minute with a fine finish from close range before Casemiro’s second-half strike saved the South Americans from a shock defeat. The draw is the best result the Nigeria has secured against the five-time world champions, after losing 3-0 in their last encounter in 2003. On the back of the great play by the Eagles, Adepoju wrote on his Twitter page: “Well-done brave SuperEagles! “This draw looks like a win and I believe this is a sign of good things to come for our senior national team. “Also, there are lots of lessons to take home against Brazil and that is very important. ￼￼#BRANGA ￼” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
