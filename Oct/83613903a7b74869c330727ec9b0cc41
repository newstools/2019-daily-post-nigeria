Evicted Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Ike, on Sunday surprised Mercy on stage. Mercy emerged winner of BBNaija ‘Pepper Dem’ edition on Sunday after scoring highest votes. She defeated Mike, Frodd , Seyi and Omashola to emerge winner of reality TV show. After she was declared winner, Ike, who was her ‘lover’ while in the BBNaija show, stormed the stage with a bunch of flowers for Mercy. He gave her the flowers even as he gave her a warm hug. Mercy, while speaking to Ebuka on stage, said she loves Ike and would take things further outside the house.   It seems #Ike wanted to propose to #Mercy on stage after she was announced winner of #Bigbrothernaija 2019 N60m grand prize .#bbnaija #bigbronaija #bbnaija2019#BBNaija4 #Bet9ja #BigBrotherNaija#BellaNaija #bbnaijapepperdem#Nigerian #nigeriaweddin #nigerians#nigeria #egypt #namibia #southafrica A post shared by  nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen) on Oct 6, 2019 at 2:30pm PDT  Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
