Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has suggested the disqualified Big Brother 2019 housemate, Natacha Akide, simply known as Tacha, is more popular than the Publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore. Sowore, one of the presidential candidates in the 2019 election has remained in custody since an Abuja Federal High Court granted him bail in the sum of N100 million for alleged treason. The situation has remained the same even when the court on Monday reduced the bail term. Omokri recalled that it took barely three days for Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe and other to bail the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu out of custody after he was granted bail. In a series of tweets on Friday, Omokri said, “It‘s not just that Nnamdi Kanu is more influential than Omoyele Sowore. “It is that even Tacha is more relevant than him. What sort of people are we? A man is in jail because of Nigeria and we cant rally and bail him? “Enyinnaya Abaribe put his senatorial position at risk to stand surety for Nnamdi Kanu and in 3 days of being granted bail, Kanu was free. “My question is this: Are there no Senators from Ondo who can do same for Sowore? “I put aside everything Omoyele Sowore did to me. I forgive him today. I call on Nigerians to rally round him. “I urge his wife to start a @gofundme and I promise to make a generous donation. Let us get him out of jail!” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
