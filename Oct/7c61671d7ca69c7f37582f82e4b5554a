Former Newcastle and West Ham manager, Sam Allardyce, has said Manchester United could be relegated this season, if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer cannot quickly turn their miserable run around. Allardyce cited United’s side in 1974 that went down to the second tier against expectations. Speaking on talkSPORT, he said: “It isn’t beyond the realms of possibility that they could catastrophically fall into more problems if confidence goes and injuries stay like they are. “Players tend not to get as fit as quick as they would do when things are going well, that’s an absolute fact. There’s the disturbance of [Paul] Pogba wanting away and who will pop up next saying, “I see this going the wrong way, I want to leave?” “Manchester United do not have enough goals and you can see it becoming a struggle. Hopefully, it’s not a struggle down the bottom end, but they’re certainly heading that way.” Solskjaer’s men are in 12th place, two points away from the drop zone and face table toppers Liverpool after the international break.
