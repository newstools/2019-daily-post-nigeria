Manchester United scouted Arsenal striker, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, for years before deciding against signing him, The Athletic reports. Aubameyang has scored 49 goals in 77 games for the Gunners, since joining from Borussia Dortmund in January 2018. But the north London club were not the only club that had followed the striker. The Red Devils scouted Aubameyang between 2016 and 2017, when he netted 73 times in 91 games for Dortmund. But the United hierarchy were not convinced and had concerns over the valuation of around £70million and his age (he turned 30 in June). They also believed would not fit Jose Mourinho’s striker profile of someone that could press and hold the ball up. United eventually bought Romelu Lukaku from Everton for £75m.
