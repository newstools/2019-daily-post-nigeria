Eden Hazard has been left out of the Real Madrid squad, for Saturday’s LaLiga clash against Mallorca. Goal reports that Hazard has been excused from the fixture, following the birth of his fourth child. Madrid face an away trip to struggling Mallorca with an already depleted squad. Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos, Luca Modric and Lucas Vazquez had all been ruled out of the encounter by coach Zinedine Zidane, while Dani Carvajal has been rested. Hazard was kept out of the first three league games of the season, after completing a €100million move from Chelsea in the summer. The Belgium international returned to action in mid-September and has since made six appearances in LaLiga and the Champions League.
