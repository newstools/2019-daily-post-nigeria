Liverpool have escaped expulsion from the Carabao Cup, for fielding an ineligible player, the UK Mirror reports. The Reds were investigated by the EFL, after youngster Pedro Chirivella played in the 2-0 win over MK Dons in the last round. Chirivella did not have the required international transfer certificate, after he returned from a loan spell with Spanish club Extremadura last season. The EFL decided it was “not appropriate” to expel Liverpool, due to a number of mitigating factors. First, the Anfield club requested the paperwork in July, but the process can only be completed with the FA’s intervention. Liverpool will remain in the competition and have been fined £200,000, of which £100,000 will be suspended until the end of the 2020/2021 season.
