Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi has insisted that he wouldn’t swap any of the trophies he has won in his career so far to become a FIFA World Cup champion with Argentina. Messi said this ahead of Barcelona’s La Liga clash with Valladolid on Tuesday. “I would’ve loved to be a FIFA World Cup champion,” Messi told TyC Sports. “But I don’t think I would change anything else in my career to be one. “This is what I was given, what God gave me. It is what it is. “I couldn’t dream of everything that I experienced after. It was far bigger than anything I could’ve imagined.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
