Brazil coach, Tite, was full of praise for Atletico Madrid player Renan Lodi, who made his debut in the 1-1 draw with Nigeria in an international friendly on Sunday. Casemiro equalized for Selecao after the break, to cancel out Joe Aribo’s delightful opener. “I know I have the pressure of the result, but you can only make unfriendly preparatory games if you let the field speak. “For example, Lodi played a lot. Played a lot. So we had the possibility of having a more aggressive player on the sides and having one more in the team players’ hall,” Tite told reporters after the game. Brazil who have gone four matches without a win, will face Argentina on October 15 and South Korea on the 19th in friendly matches.
