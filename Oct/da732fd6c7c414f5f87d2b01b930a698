Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has said the inclusion of seven of his players in the 2019 Ballon d’Or shortlist, is deserved recognition for his team’s performances last season. The Reds lifted the Champions League and finished just one point behind Premier League champions Manchester City in 2018/2019. On the back of that impressive campaign, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Alisson Becker, Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane, Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Georginio Wijnaldum were all named among the 30 contenders for the Ballon d’Or. The winner will be revealed in Paris on December 2. Klopp, reacting to the shortlist, told Liverpool’s official website: “I am not sure who is not on the list from our boys! It is nice. “We have had so much attention and reward for the things that happened last year and that’s all good. There is one more big day and then last season is closed. “The boys deserved it. It is the big one and I am not sure it happened too often that seven players from one club were on the shortlist and that’s good. “In the end, someone will decide it. It’s nice and it’s what the boys deserve for the season they played last year.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
