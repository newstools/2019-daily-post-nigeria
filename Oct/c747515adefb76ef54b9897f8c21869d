Zamfara State Governor, Hon. Bello Muhammed Matawalle has reassured the people of Zamfara State and non-indigenes doing business in the state of their safety following the current killing of nine soldiers in Jangebe, near Anka local government area by the unrepentant armed bandits. The Governor said that he had instructed the combined forces of the army, police and other security agencies to be watchful and intensify more efforts to prevent reoccurrence of the ugly incident. He encouraged the people to always endeavor to report any suspicious movement of people to the security agencies in the state. Governor Matawalle said that the target was to distract the focus of the state government from delivering the dividends of democracy for the people. The governor re-emphasized that the resolve of his government was to ensure perfect security of lives and properties in the state. “The fight against criminal elements would not be treated with a mere wave of the hand,” he assured. “I am very sure that security is the responsibility of all and not the responsibility of the government alone,” he added. He, however, appealed to the traditional leaders to ensure that their territories were under their watchful eyes so as to ensure perfect security of lives and properties in their areas.
