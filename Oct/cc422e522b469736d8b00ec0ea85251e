Real Madrid defender, Dani Carvajal has disclosed that he was ‘thrilled’ by teammate, Eden Hazard after the Belgium international scored his first La Liga goal for Zinedine Zidane’s side in their 4-2 win over Granada on Saturday. Hazard scored his first goal for the Spanish giants, as Los Blancos stayed top of LaLiga. The former Chelsea star also teed up Luka Modric for the goal of the game just after the hour mark. But the home side let their opponents back into the contest when Darwin Machis converted from the spot after Alphonse Areola brought down Carlos Fernandez. Domingos Duarte set up a tense finale with his close-range finish 13 minutes from time, only for James Rodriguez to kill off the comeback to move Madrid four points clear at the top of La Liga. “I am thrilled for Hazard, it was a well-deserved goal, he is working well and getting better every time,” Carvajal told reporters after the match. He added: “The coach told me to play left-back because of injuries, I did it a couple of times last season and that’s what he wanted me to do, but the important thing is the three points. “We can’t let this keep happening at 3-0 up at home, we need to correct that because it will cost us points. “Going ahead and them not being able to equalise is not a sign of strength. We need to be more convincing. “Now we go into the break league leaders, regardless of what is happening the rest of the weekend. We can start to focus on a difficult week away from home.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
