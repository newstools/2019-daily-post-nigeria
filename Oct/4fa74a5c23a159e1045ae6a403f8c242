Chelsea defender, Fikayo Tomori has reiterated his stance on turning out for England over Nigeria and Canada. The 21-year-old, who said he would have represented either Nigeria or Canada had they extended an invitation to him before the Three Lions, said he is focused on becoming a full England international even if he does not get cap-tied this month. DAILY POST reports that Tomori, who is also eligible to play for Nigeria and Canada was included in England squad for their Euro 2020 qualifying games against Czech Republic and Bulgaria on October 11 and 14. “I think the call-up kind of solidifies that,” Tomori told Sky Sports at a press conference on Tuesday. “Being eligible to play for three countries was, it depends on how you look at it, a good thing and a bad thing. “Once I got the call-up to England there wasn’t really a doubt in my mind that I was going to commit. “Being here now, I just want to try and get my first cap and then try and get more after that as well.” Tomori is behind Harry Maguire and Michael Keane in the pecking order for central defence in England squad.
