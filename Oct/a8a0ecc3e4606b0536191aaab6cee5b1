Jose Mourinho would be interested in the Arsenal manager’s job if it became available, according to ESPN FC. Gunners’ boss, Unai Emery, is coming under increasing pressure at the Emirates following a mixed start to the season. It is, however, understood that there are no immediate plans to dismiss Emery, who takes his team to face Liverpool in the Carabao Cup fourth round on Wednesday.

The 56-year-old has been working as a pundit on Sky Sports since the new season started.
