Popular Nollywood actress, Bidemi Kosoko, has revealed why ex-Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate, Diane was evicted from the reality show.
Kosoko alleged that Diane was evicted from the BBNaija show because her “Juju expired.”

In a post on her Instagram page, the actress wondered how Diane escaped nomination till she got to finals with her “maggot dancing style.” “So bye bye to Diane, her Juju has expired. How can she reach to final like play like play with that her maggot dancing style. Please don’t come for meooooo. “Seriously, I don’t know what she was doing in that house all this while. How can she keep escaping nominations like that every week, seriously.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
