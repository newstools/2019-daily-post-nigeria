Chelsea striker, Olivier Giroud, has said he cannot accept his current situation at the club, having fallen behind Tammy Abraham in the pecking order. Blues boss, Frank Lampard, has put his faith in youngster Abraham, who has rewarded him with seven goals in the Premier League already. He also netted in the Champions League away at Lille and his strong form saw him called up to the latest England squad, coming off the bench against Czech Republic. Giroud has been limited to just two starts in all competitions this season as a result, but feels he deserves a bigger role. Asked about his current lack of game time at Chelsea, Giroud told Le Pelerin: “Accept it? No, I do not accept it. “You do not have to be fatalistic in certain situations. I have always been respectful and humble. Even if I do not agree with the coach, I do not criticise him. “But in myself, I cannot accept it because I know what I’m worth on a pitch. Last year, when I felt that I deserved to play, I asked the coach for explanations.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
