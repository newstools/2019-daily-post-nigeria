Former president, Goodluck Jonathan, has criticised African leaders who are desperate to remain in power beyond their constitutional limits. He wondered why anyone would want to stay in office for 14 years. Speaking at the Constitutional Term Limits Summit holding in Niamey, the Niger Republic on Wednesday, the ex-President also said that periodic elections were not the only characteristics of democracy. Jonathan who spent six years in office, pointed out that democracy was participatory and should go beyond the legislature. He said, “Periodic elections alone is not democracy. Democracy is about people. The people must be carried along. Democracy must be participatory. Participation must be extended beyond the parliament. “Why would anyone want to serve as President for up to 14 years? It is not personal property. Democracy is about the participation of the people in governance.” Speaking also, the Regional Director of NDI, Dr. Chris Fomunyoh said, “The Constitutional Term Limits Summit comes at a critical time when Africa’s democratic progress is facing new challenges and democratic backsliding is becoming more prominent. “The Summit will provide an opportunity for leaders and activists on the continent to ensure that progress made through the renewal of political leadership through the ballot box is sustained and encouraged.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
