The founder and General Overseer of the Word Bible Church International, Prophet Julius Babatunde Kumoluyi has advised the federal government to use the money recovered from treasury looters for the empowerment of youths in the country. He said engaging young Nigerians in meaningful ventures will reduce crime to the barest minimum and current insecurity in the country. The prophet stated this while speaking with newsmen in his country home, Igbara-Odo, Ekiti South-West local government area of Ekiti state ahead of the 30th anniversary of the church and his ministerial call. According to Prophet Kumoluyi, the increase in the involvement of youths in internet fraud and other criminal activities was a result of the failure of government to have clear cut plans for the people. He counselled the federal government to invest all funds recovered from looters by providing industries in order to generate employment opportunities for teeming unemployed youths in the country. The General Superintendent of the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) Worldwide, Pastor Samuel Oladele is expected to deliver the anniversary Sermon, with the theme ‘The Faithfulness of God’. Speaking further on youth empowerment, the man of God said,” I am appealing to people at the corridor of power today to think about tomorrow. We need to sit down in this country and look at how we will improve the country. These youth have turned to ‘Yahoo Yahoo’ because they felt the government did not have plans for them, that is why crimes are increasing. Government must do their responsibilities. ” All the recovered looters, people are expecting them to use the money to establish industries where our children can work but I don’t know whether they are planning to do it. I pray God give the leaders knowledge to do what is expected, ” he said. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
