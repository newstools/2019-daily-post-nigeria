A Pharmacist with the Federal Ministry of Health, Boat Barnabas, was on Sunday reportedly kidnapped on Kachia-Kaduna road. It was gathered that he was kidnapped along with occupants of two vehicles, a Golf and Toyota cars yet to be identified. A motorist, Bege Mark, who narrowly escaped being kidnapped sent a text message to the Kaduna State Chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, Reverend Joseph Hayab, saying, “I am at the scene now. 3 minutes delay saved me. I would have been kidnapped.” Recall that the incidents occurred on Sunday, barely twenty-four hours after the abduction of Assistant Commissioner of Police, ACP, Musa Rabo, now rescued. The incident, according to report, occurred immediately after railway crossing between Sabeji and Ido village, along Kachia – Kaduna road. All efforts made through phone calls proved abortive, as he could not respond up to the time of filing this report. However, a motorist who escaped the kidnap incident, Bege Mark, said, “l texted a message to the Kaduna State Chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Joseph Hayab, saying that Pharmacist Boat Barnabas of Federal Ministry of Health was among those kidnapped.” No known contact has been established with the parents of those kidnapped up to the time of filing this report by the abductors suspected to be bandits.
