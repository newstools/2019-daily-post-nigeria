Former Manchester United captain, Roy Keane, has slammed the club’s players for their behaviour in the build-up to their 1-1 with Liverpool on Sunday. Prior to kick-off at Old Trafford, Manchester United duo Andreas Pereira and Fred were both seen exchanging pleasantries with Reds forward and fellow Brazilian Roberto Firmino in the tunnel. And Keane was not impressed by their conduct, insisting that that was in stark contrast to the far fiercer approach he (Keane) took during his playing days. “I’m disgusted with the players. You’re going to war, they’re hugging and kissing,” Keane said on Sky Sports. “Don’t even look at the opposition. You’re going into battle against them. The game hasn’t changed that much, the players have changed. You’re going to war against these players and they’re hugging each other. “Chat to them after the game, or don’t even chat to them after the game.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
