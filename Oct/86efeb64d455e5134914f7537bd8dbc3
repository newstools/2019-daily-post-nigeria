Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has revealed he remains in contact with Jose Mourinho. Lampard’s management career in the Premier League, began with a 4-0 loss at Manchester United. However, performances have improved and the Blues are joint-fourth in the Premier League ahead of Saturday’s clash with Newcastle. Lampard told talkSPORT: “With Jose we would have texts from time to time. We had some at the start of the season around the United game where he had a little go! “It’s all good. I’ve sat in the punditry chair for a year so I understand the need to say things so I’m certainly not going to bang on too much. In terms of him, yeah we have a relationship.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
