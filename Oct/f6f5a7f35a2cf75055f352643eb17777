Manchester City will be without playmaker, Kevin De Bruyne, when they take on Dinamo Zagreb in the UEFA Champions League fixture on Tuesday night. The Premier League champions confirmed that De Bruyne picked up a groin injury during Man City’s 3-1 win against Everton over the weekend. A statement from Man City’s official website read: “Kevin De Bruyne suffered a groin injury in the win over Everton and will miss tonight’s game against Dinamo Zagreb. “The extent of his layoff depends on how well he responds to the rehabilitation programme overseen by the club’s medical staff. “Everyone at City wishes Kevin a speedy recovery and we all look forward to seeing him back in blue soon.” De Bruyne will hope to recover from the injury before Man City’s Premier League clash against Wolves this weekend.
