Brazilian star, Neymar on Friday said he was honoured and proud after making history in his side’s international friendly 1-1 draw against Senegal at the Singapore Stadium. DAILY POST reports that the Paris Saint-Germain forward became the seventh player to win 100 caps for Brazil after the Selecao drew against the Teranga Lions. The 27-year-old joined the likes of Cafu (142), Roberto Carlos (125), Dani Alves (117), Lucio (105), Claudio Taffarel (101) Robinho (100) in reaching the landmark. In an interview with Otro, Neymar said: “I think only on the day, or one day before, will I be able to understand the magnitude of playing the hundredth match for my country, Brazil. “Obviously when I realised I was close to this milestone, I had butterflies in my stomach and I felt quite anxious, but while I am here and not in the Brazilian team environment, I don’t think about it much but I am very proud of it. “I feel great happiness in being able to reach this milestone as a Brazilian national team player and as an athlete. “I think everybody dreams of playing for their country. And being able to represent Brazil one hundred times is a great honour.” Neymar will now hope to lead Brazil to victory when they face Nigeria in their next international friendly on Sunday.
