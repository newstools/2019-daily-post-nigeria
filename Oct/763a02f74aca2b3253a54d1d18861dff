The family of Qudus Anifowose, a 14-year-old allegedly murdered by his teenage neighbour in Ire-Agunfoye, Ikorodu, has begged the Lagos Police Commissioner, Zubairu Muazu, to arrest her son’s killers. Mrs Risikat Anifowose, mother of the deceased, speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), said that her late son was last seen with 17-year-old Daniel Amme before his mutilated body was found in their backyard. She, however, added that a search party, which was formed when her son went missing on October 14, found his dismembered body in an uncompleted building behind Amme’s house two days later. “I am begging the CP of Lagos State that he should please come to my rescue; the suspected killers of my son are being shielded and helped by the police. “My son was just 14-year-old and why should he die such a painful death, with his organs being removed, please help me. “His tongue, heart and private organ were removed and there are still bloodstains over the fence on which his body was thrown into the uncompleted building from Amme’s compound. “I was shocked when I learnt that the police had released my son’s suspected killer and grandmother and allowed both to move out of the community “We are appealing to the CP of Lagos to ensure a proper investigation is carried out and the perpetrators brought to justice accordingly,” Confirming the incident, Lagos Police Command Police Relations Officer, DSP Bala Elkana, told NAN that investigations were ongoing to ensure that the culprits were brought to book. He assured the parents of the deceased that justice would prevail and the perpetrators would be punished accordingly. “Detectives are on the issue and investigations are ongoing. We assure that the offenders would be brought to book,” Elkana said. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
