Three girls said to be sex workers have died in a fire outbreak in a brothel in Nnewi, Anambra State. A source said the motel which is located at Ezekwuabo Otolo Nnewi close to St. Thomas Anglican Church (Akwudo) called Padded Joint, was gutted with fire in the early hours of Friday. The source said the cause of the fire was unknown, but started after the owner of the brothel closed for the day, leaving behind three girls who were suspected to be prostitutes. An eyewitness who pleaded anonymity, said, “the owner of the motel who is a woman fondly called ‘Obodo Umu Anumanu’ is a native of Ndimgbu in Otolo but married in Mbanagu-Otolo. “She had closed the motel apartment for the day, and three girls who slept in the motel because they did not go to work were caught up in the fire, and they died.” The source said it is a normal occurrence for the woman to close the apartment and go home with the keys even if there are girls that did not go out that night with clients. “The three girls could not escape because the rooms were locked and there was no way exit as at that time,” our source said. Anambra State police commissioner, Mr John Abang confirmed the incident, but said the deceased persons were waiters who slept in the motel. He said, “Yes, its a drinking joint and the waiters who do sleep over in the joint lost their lives. Very unfortunate” He added that, “The owner has made useful statement to the police.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
