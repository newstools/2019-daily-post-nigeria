West Ham United defender, Angelo Ogbonna, has revealed why he opted to play for Italy at international level instead of Nigeria. Igbonna was born in Cassino, Italy, to Nigerian parents, who are both from Owerri West in Imo State. He made his debut for Italy’s senior national team in a friendly against Poland in November 2011. The central defender then became cap-tied to the European nation when he started in a World Cup qualifier vs Bulgaria in September 2012. Sharing his view on racism, Ogbonna told West Ham’s official website, ”I grew up with Nigerian parents, but I chose to play for the Italian national team because I felt that was right. ”Whether you are black, Asian or whatever, you should be proud. I always say, we should be focused on the important things, which are not black or white. ”We are the same people. We all laugh and we all cry. For me, there is no difference.” At 31 years old, Ogbonna has played 13 times for Italy.
