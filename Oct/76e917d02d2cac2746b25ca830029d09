Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has called on his side to be more clinical and suggested their current form in front of goal, means they’re not ready to win the Champions League, the UK Mirror reports. Guardiola’s side have claimed 2-0 wins in their past three games. While the victory closed the gap on league leaders Liverpool to six points, the Citizens could have won by a greater margin, with a number of chances going begging at Selhurst Park. City boasted 72% possession against Crystal Palace and registered 21 shots, with Guardiola not impressed by the fact they could only score twice. “The people say about the Champions League, that target. We still are not ready. “We create a lot, don’t concede, but can improve. We’ve scored a lot over the last two seasons and I don’t have doubts about that, but we have to keep going, work on that. “We missed a lot of chances and also lost a lot of chances in the box [against Palace]. We have to be clinical,” Guardiola said. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
