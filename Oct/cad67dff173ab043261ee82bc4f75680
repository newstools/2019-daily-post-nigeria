Real Madrid and Spain captain, Sergio
Ramos’ has said he would rather have traded his 168th cap for a victory in Euro 2020 Group F qualifier against Norway on Saturday. Spain drew 1-1 against Norway in a match that made Ramos his country’s record appearance maker, surpassing goalkeeper Iker Casillas. The outcome of the match ruined Spain’s 100% record in Group F. “All record that is personal is a little secondary,” said Ramos after the game. “I would have happily traded this 168th cap for a victory. It was not the case. But this record is a great reward after so many years and it’s a great source of huge pride. “I am emotional every time I put on this shirt. That will not change and I hope to continue doing so for many years.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
