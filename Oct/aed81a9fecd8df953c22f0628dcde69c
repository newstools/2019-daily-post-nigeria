An Upper Area Court in Mpape, Abuja, on Monday ordered that a 28-year-old identified as Abubakar Umar, be remanded in a correctional centre for allegedly defiling a seven-year-old boy. The Presiding Judge, Hassan Muhammad, gave the order after Umar pleaded guilty to two counts of unnatural offence. NAN reports that Muhammad adjourned the case until Oct. 28. The Prosecution Counsel, Stanley Nwaforaku, had told the court that the accused committed the offence on Sept. 28. Nwaforaku said that the accused intentionally lured a seven-year-old boy into the bush and defiled him. The prosecutor said the offence contravened the provisions of sections 272 and 284 Penal Code.
