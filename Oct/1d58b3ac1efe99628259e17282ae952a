A Kaduna Chief Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday ordered that a 75-year-old farmer, Ahmadu Sani, who allegedly sodomised a 14-year-old boy, be remanded in a correctional centre, pending legal advice. Magistrate Lukman Sidi who refused to take the plea of Sani ordered the police to return the case file to the Kaduna State Director of Public Prosecutions. “The court lacked jurisdiction over the matter, so the case file should be returned to the Kaduna State Director of Public Prosecutions for advice”, he said. News agency of Nigeria,(NAN) reports that Sidi adjourned the case until Nov. 15 for mention. Sani resides in Makarfi Local Government Area of Kaduna State and is being tried with a count of unnatural offence. Insp. Chidi Leo the Prosecution Counsel, told the court that the defendant lured a 14-year-old boy to his farm in Makarfi LGA, and sodomised the minor. Leo said that during the investigation, the defendant voluntary confessed to the crime. He added that the offence contravened the provisions of Section 259 of the Kaduna State Penal Code Law, 2017.
