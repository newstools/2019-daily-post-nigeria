Former Chelsea and Manchester United boss, Jose Mourinho, has reportedly identified Wolverhampton Wanderers’ midfielder, Ruben Neves, as his first signing should he (Mourinho) takeover at the Bernabeu. Tottenham midfielder Christian Eriksen and Red Bull Salzburg’s Erling Haaland are also in the Portuguese list.
Mourinho has been without a managerial job since after he was sacked by Manchester United in December 2018. The Portuguese has been consistently linked with a return to Real Madrid amid suggestions that Frenchman, Zinedine Zidane could lose his job following recent poor results. El Desmarque reports that Mourinho will attempt to bring Neves to the Spanish capital if he does indeed replace Zidane. Neves joined Wolves from Porto in 2017, helping them secure a return to the Premier League before impressing in his first season in England’s top flight. This term, the Portugal international has scored twice and provided one assist in 16 appearances in all competitions this season.
