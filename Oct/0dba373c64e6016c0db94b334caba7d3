Manchester United have denied that Paul Pogba is making fresh wage demands, according to SportsMail. United are angered at reports that Pogba is asking for £600,000-a-week to stay at Old Trafford. The club fear the French midfielder is being scapegoated, for a miserable start to the season under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Pogba, who was keen on joining Real Madrid last summer, has played only twice since August because of a recurring ankle problem and is a doubt for Sunday’s game at Newcastle. A club source said: “Paul still has two years left on his current deal with an option of an extra year so there’s been no talks about a new contract and nothing from Paul saying he wants an increase in wages. “He’s fully focused on getting 100 per cent fit again and helping the team. “Anyone that says he’s been asking for £600,000-a-week is wrong and it’s a surprise to us when someone in the game like Karren Brady [West Ham vice-chairman] refers to it.” Brady wrote in her weekend newspaper column, that United should sell Pogba if he’s demanding that sort of money.
