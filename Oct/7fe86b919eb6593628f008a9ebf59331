Lionel Messi has said he has “never had the need to leave the best club in the world”, with Barcelona still very much part of his present and future. There have been speculations about Messi’s future, especially after revealing he considered a move in 2013, after being caught up in a tax avoidance case. On Wednesday, the Argentina captain was presented with the sixth Golden Shoe of his career. At 32, there has been talk about how long more he has left to play. Messi told Gazzetta dello Sport when that question was put to him: “I’ll find out over time, because you realise by yourself when you can’t go on. “I’ll be the one to say enough is enough, but I don’t know how much longer that will be. At the moment I feel good.” He added: “Each of us looks for experiences that he considers to be best for himself. “I have never had the need to leave the best club in the world, which is Barcelona. Here I enjoy every workout, every game and the city. “Overall this is a complete experience and I have always had in mind what my goal is here without having to go looking for it elsewhere.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
