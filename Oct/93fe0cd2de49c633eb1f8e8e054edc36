The Vice Chancellor of the Federal University of Oye Ekiti in Ekiti State, Prof. Kayode Soremekun, has taken a swipe at the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), saying the students body cannor tell him “how to run the university.” NANS had earlier threatened showdown with Prof. Soremekun over alleged increase in some fees payable by students of FUOYE; accusing him and the management of the university of “insensitivity”. The students leaders also accused the Vice Chancellor of “misappropriation of the university’s funds in the course of executing majority of the projects under his watch.” But the Vice Chancellor debunked the allegation of funds misappropriation, saying, “NANS cannot substantiate its claims.” Speaking through the Public Relations Officer of the university, Godfrey Bakji, the Vice Chancellor did not deny increasing the fees. He, however, said fees could not be increased without the approval of the National Universities Commission (NUC) and other statutory agencies. Bakji, in a message sent to DAILY POST on Sunday said: “These allegations are totally false. This body cannot determine to the VC how to run the university. “Remember also that as a head of the institution, he is responsible to other statutory agencies such as the NUC and MOE. So if what he is charging is above the regulations, this bodies wouldn’t have allowed it. “NANS can’t substantiate their claims for misappropriation, please.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
