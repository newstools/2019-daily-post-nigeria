Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has claimed other players deserve to be in his squad more than Ozil. Ozil is the Gunners’ highest earner, but has made just one appearance in all competitions this season. He was left out of the squad entirely for their Europa League 4-0 win over Standard Liege on Thursday night. And Emery, speaking after the game, said the out-of-favour 30-year-old should continue working in order to get back in his squad. Emery said: “I am thinking every time the best players for the match. “When I decided he isn’t in the squad it’s because other players deserve it more. “What does he have to do? Continue working. “Sunday we have another match. We are going to decide again.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
