Mr Izam Azi, Plateau Government Head of Service (HOS), says deliberations with relevant stakeholders for the implementation of the N30,000 minimum wage for workers in state have begun. NAN reports that Izam stated this Thursday in Jos at the 10th Quadrennial Delegate Conference of the National Association of Nigerian Nurses and Midwives (NANNM). He, therefore, appealed for understanding from civil servants as they waited for the outcome of the deliberations. He assured that Plateau would be among the first to implement the new minimum wage, as Gov. Simon Lalong is a member of the negotiations team. The HOS also disclosed that the Governor had approved the promotion of 10,000 civil servants in the state. He said that the promotion was with corresponding salaries, adding that the names of benefiting workers would soon be made public. He urged the workers to be diligent in their responsibilities. Izam acknowledged that nurses practicing in the state had been up and doing in their profession. He, however, charged them to be more dedicated to their duties, and to also handle patients with care.
