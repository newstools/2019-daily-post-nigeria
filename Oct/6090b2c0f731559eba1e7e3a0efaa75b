Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said his side were “excellent”, during their hard-fought Carabao Cup victory over Chelsea. Marcus Rashford scored a brace, including a sensational free-kick, as United clinched a 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge, to reach the EFL Cup quarter-finals. The England striker put the Red Devils ahead on 25 minutes from the penalty spot, before Michy Batshuayi equalized for the Blues. Rashford settled the game with a stunning free-kick with 17 minutes left. “We’ve travelled a lot in the last week. We’ve got a good team spirit and camaraderie. “It shows the character of the team. We get the games where we want them. We’ve been leading 1-0 in many games and not kicked on. “Today we were excellent, with fast flowing flowing. That’s Manchester United. We’re trying to get back to that. “Marcus has that strike in him. I’ve seen him in training so many times. “When you give young lads the experience, like Brandon Williams got tonight – and the kid was outstanding – it’s only going to help them. “We know we’re not the finished product, we’re a work in progress and keep trying to improve,” Solskjaer told Sky Sports.
