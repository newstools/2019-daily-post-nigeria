Following the recent outbreak of yellow fever in Bauchi State, which led to the death of over 15 people, another six new deaths have been recorded, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths so far to 22. This is just as immunisation of workers in the oil exploration sites in the state has began. This was disclosed by the Executive Chairman of the Bauchi State Primary Health Care
Development Agency (BSPHCDA), Dr Rilwanu Mohammed, while giving situation report on the outbreak on the deadly disease, on Monday. Mohammed, who disclosed that no fewer than 143 suspected cases of Yellow Fever were recorded out of which 24 cases were confirmed and 22 died, said all the cases were from Alkaleri Local Government Area of the state. He also disclosed that 10 out of the 22 people that died of Yellow Fever were rangers working with the Yankari Games Reserve, adding that only 79 per cent coverage was recorded in the on going immunisation campaign against the vector that carries the disease. The BSPHCDA Executive Chairman lamented that some people were still declining to take the vaccine, hence the deaths were still being recorded. He disclosed that besides the 500,000 doses of vaccine provided by the federal government, the state has received another batch of 600,000 vaccines. He explained that the immunisation would now be extended to Kirfi local government in the state, oil exploration sites, and parts of villages in Gombe and Gombe State.
