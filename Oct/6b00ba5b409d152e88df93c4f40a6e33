Former Arsenal defender, Martin Keown, has said manager Unai Emery, is partly responsible for Granit Xhaka’s clash with fans during their 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace on Sunday. Xhaka threw his arms up in the air and cupped his ears, after his substitution was greeted by boos. As the noise around the Emirates intensified, Xhaka was seen mouthing “f*** off” at the home fans and removed his shirt before storming down the tunnel. The club is now considering whether to strip Xhaka of the captaincy. “Sunday was not the first time Granit Xhaka has been jeered by his own fans,” Keown told the Daily Mail. “It happened on September 22 too, when Aston Villa visited. Villa were leading 2-1 at the time, then Xhaka was substituted and serenaded by boos. “Arsenal, despite being down to 10 men, went on to win 3-2 without the midfielder. Then five days later, Unai Emery names Xhaka as captain anyway. “Emery is as much to blame as anyone. If you let the players pick their skipper, then it becomes a popularity contest and that is not what leadership is about. “I’ve never had a manager who decided the captaincy that way and, for me, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is still the safer bet.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
