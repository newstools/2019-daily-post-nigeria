Speaker of Ogun State House of Assembly, Hon. Olakunle Oluomo, has been dragged before an Appeal Court in Ibadan, Oyo State by his closest rival in the March 9 House of Assembly election, Mr Wemimo Owolabi. Owolabi, DAILY POST learnt, is asking the tribunal to invalidate Oluomo’s election and declare him winner of same. Owolabi, candidate of the Allied People’s Movement (APM) had earlier approached the election petition tribunal, asking it to nullify Oluomo’s election for alleged misconduct and overvoting. DAILY POST, however, recalled that the election petition tribunal, headed by Justice Adenike Coker, on September 20, upheld the election of the Speaker, Oluomo, as the lawmaker representing Ifo Constituency 1. Sitting in Abeokuta, the three-member tribunal held that the evidence submitted by Owolabi, of the APM was insufficient to nullify the election of Oluomo, candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC. Not satisfied with the decision of the tribunal, Owolabi, it was learnt, had filed his petitions at the Appeal Court, asking it to upturn the judgement of the lower tribunal.
