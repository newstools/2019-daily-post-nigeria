Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, has threatened to quit the senior national team after the friendly against Brazil if he is not paid an outstanding three months’ salary by the Nigeria Football Federation. The football federation had earlier denied reports that they are owning the German three months’ salary. The German is reportedly earning about 50,000 dollars every month (equivalent of N17.85 million in Nigerian currency). BBC journalists Osasu Obayiuwana, who provided an update on the matter, tweeted on Saturday, ”Reliable information from Singapore indicates that Gernot Rohr COULD quit the Super Eagles job, after the game against Brazil. ”Rohr is infuriated that the Nigeria Football Federation publicly denied the fact that he is being owed three months wages.” Rohr’s lawyer, Jean-Jacques Bertrand, who also represents Manchester United legend Eric Cantona, is in discussions with the leadership of the NFF over his client’s unpaid entitlements.
