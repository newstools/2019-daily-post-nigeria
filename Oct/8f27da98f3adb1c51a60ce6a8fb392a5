Portugal captain, Cristiano Ronaldo, has reacted to his side’s 2-1 defeat to Ukraine in a Euro 2020 qualifier on Monday. Ronaldo, who reached 700 career goals in official matches, during their 2-1 loss to Ukraine, said he does not “look for records, they look for me.” The five-time Ballon d’Or winner converted a penalty in the 72nd minute, after a Ukraine player was adjudged to have handled a long-range shot in the box. Ronaldo is the sixth player to achieve the feat, following ex-Germany striker Gerd Muller, Hungary legend Ferenc Puskas, Brazil’s Pele and Romario and the Czech Republic’s Josef Bican. The only other active player close to breaching the 700-goal mark, is Barcelona and Argentina star Lionel Messi, who has 672. “Not just anyone can reach this figure,” Ronaldo told reporters after the match. “Thank you to my team-mates, colleagues and coaches who have helped me to become the player I am. “I am disappointed that we didn’t win, but proud of the team.” Ronaldo added: “How many records do I have? I don’t know. I have to enjoy the moment and thank those who helped me reach this impressive mark. “The last time I played at this ground I won the Champions League, a beautiful moment that is in the past. Today we played well but couldn’t win. “Records come naturally – I don’t go looking for them; records are looking for me! Without having an obsession, they happen naturally.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
