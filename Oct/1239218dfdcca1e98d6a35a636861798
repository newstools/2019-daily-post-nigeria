The Inspector General of Police, Mr Mohammed Adamu, has directed officers and men of the force to henceforth declare their assets. Adamu gave the directive in Abuja when members of the board of Code of Conduct Bureau, led by its chairman, Prof. Mohammed Isah paid him a courtesy visit on Tuesday. Adamu noted that declaration of assets of public officers was compulsory and that failure to do so was against the law. “We are aware that declaration of assets is mandatory for all public officers and not doing so means you are breaking the law. “We want to assure you that we will assign an office to be responsible for that and they will make sure that all our officers and men comply with this directive. “This will ensure that we have one channel so that whenever you want to check, it will be easy. “So officially, the office that will be responsible for this is the office of the Commissioner of Police, Research and Planning while the Deputy Inspector General of Police, Research and Planning will oversee their activities,” he said. The Inspector General added that the collaboration of both organisations (CCB and Police) was important for them to discharge their respective duties effectively. Earlier, the Chairman, Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB), Prof. Mohammed Isah, noted that the assistance of the police was required to enforce the code of conduct on all public officers. While commending the IGP for declaring his assets, he added that the bureau could not execute court orders on its own. “The Code of Conduct Bureau has the investigative powers but this power cannot be achieved alone. “We need to cooperate, share information and collaborate to achieve our mandate,” he said.
