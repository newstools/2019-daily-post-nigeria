The seven-man panel of the Supreme Court on Wednesday delivered its first ruling on the appeal by the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and its presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar against President Muhamamdu Buhari’s victory. In a short ruling, the panel overruled Atiku and his party’s request that their seven interlocutory appeals should be heard after the main one must have been argued. The court stated that the main appeal shall be binding on all others, and consolidated all the appeals on the matter. The lead judge and Chief Justice of Nigeria, CJN, Tanko Muhammed pointed out that it would be unnecessary to hear the interlocutory appeals when a judgment on the main appeal marked would suffice.
