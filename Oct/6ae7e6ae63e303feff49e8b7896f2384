England manager, Gareth Southgate, has revealed why his side were defeated 2-1 by Czech Republic in their Euro 2020 qualifier fixture on Friday night in Prague. Two goals from Jakub Brabec and Zdenek Ondrasek ensure Czech Republic defeated Three Lions in Prague as Harry Kane’s fifth-minute penalty goal was not enough. However, Southgate believes that Czech defeated England because his players were not good enough, adding that his team have to move forward. “We certainly didn’t underestimate the Czech team,” Southgate told reporters after the match in Prague. “A lot of credit to them for the way they played, but that didn’t surprise us. We knew, coming to Prague, they would be highly motivated, they have some good players. “And nothing in the preparation for the game suggested that we would get the performance we did. “So, the players are human beings, some nights it doesn’t happen, and tonight was one of those nights.” Southgate added: “We have to find the solution, we have to accept we weren’t good enough and we have to move forward but congratulate the Czechs on their performance. “I mean this is football, all of the players, throughout their careers and for us as the coaching staff, football is all about responding to setbacks. “We haven’t had too many, so it feels even more unpleasant because it’s a while since we’ve felt this way.” Southgate’s men will now face Bulgaria in their next fixture on Monday.
