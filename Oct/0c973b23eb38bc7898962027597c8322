Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has criticised 33-year-old experienced playmaker, David Silva, following his side’s 2-0 shock defeat to Wolves in the Premier League on Sunday. Two late goals from Adama Traore gave the visitors all three points against the Premier League champions at Eithad Stadium. According to the Daily Mail, Guardiola blamed Silva for not producing enough runnings in the midfield during the encounter against Wolves. The Spaniard said to the 33-year-old in the dressing room: “David, you didn’t give us enough running. Where were the legs?” The result against Wolves means Manchester City are now eight points behind leaders, Liverpool on the Premier League table. The Citizens will tackle Crystal Palace in an away Premier League fixture on October 19 after the international break.
