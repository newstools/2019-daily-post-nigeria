Arsenal striker, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, has been named the winner of the Premier League Player of the Month for September. Aubameyang proved to be decisive for the Gunners last month, scoring in all the games he featured. The 30-year-old found the back of the net five times, to take his goal tally to seven in the English top flight. Aubameyang grabbed a brace in the Gunners’ 2-2 draw against Watford and was also on the scoresheet against Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester United and Aston Villa. The impressive performances ensured he won the award ahead of Manchester City winger, Riyad Mahrez. The forward also beat Leicester City’s Ricardo Pereira, Aston Villa’s John McGinn, Tottenham’s Son Heung-min, Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne, Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold and Bournemouth striker, Callum Wilson, to the individual accolade.
