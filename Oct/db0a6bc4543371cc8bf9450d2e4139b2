Members of the Arsenal squad, have raised eyebrows over the inclusion of Mesut Ozil, as one of five new captains at the club, the UK Sun reports. Granit Xhaka was named club captain after a secret vote was conducted at the end of September. The Gunners have been without a permanent skipper since the departure of Laurent Koscielny, while the club also lost experienced players such as Aaron Ramsey, Nacho Monreal and Petr Cech last summer. Emery avoided naming a new captain throughout pre-season and instead insisted on holding a secret ballot that would help decide a new skipper and a ‘leadership group’ behind him. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette, Hector Bellerin and Ozil were named as Xhaka’s four deputies following the vote. But the inclusion of the German has raised suspicion in the squad. Emery made the announcements to the squad, but did not reveal the exact details of the ballot results. And it is believed that the squad are sceptical Ozil was actually successful in the vote.
