Tottenham Hotspur striker, Harry Kane, has admitted that the side’s recent struggles, marks the “toughest” period in his time at the club. Spurs escaped with a late draw at home to Premier League strugglers Watford on Saturday, following a controversial Dele Alli equaliser. Manager Mauricio Pochettino has come under pressure, following a poor start to the Premier League season that has seen just three wins, including losses to Brighton, Leicester and Newcastle. “It’s hard to put a finger on exactly what’s wrong,” Kane said at a news conference on Monday. “Sometimes when you’re having a run of form like this, things don’t always go your way in games. It’s about sticking together and if we win tomorrow night that can kick start us. “It’s probably the toughest time since I’ve been here. It’s just another challenge though. The road to success will always have bumps and this is just one of them.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
