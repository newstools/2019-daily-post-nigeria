The international friendly match between the Super Eagles of Nigeria and the Samba Boys of Brazil may be called off. Nigeria is billed to tackle Brazil in Singapore on October 13th. The match may be called off at the last minute unless the organisers are able to sort out the travelling arrangement of the Nigerian delegation, according to the Nation. The newspaper reports that the Nigeria Football Federation’s delegation expected to travel on Tuesday, failed to get necessary travelling documents, including visas. The situation may put the match in jeopardy. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
