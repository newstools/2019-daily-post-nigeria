Everton boss, Marco Silva, has hailed Super Eagles forward, Alex Iwobi and two others after the Toffees 2-0 win against Watford in the League Cup on Tuesday night. Iwobi impressed in the second half of the game after the introduction of former Arsenal teammate, Theo Walcott. Iwobi was also unlucky not to have scored in the sixth minute of the game when his shot from the edge of the area cannoned off the woodwork and away with Gomes stranded. Speaking at the post-match press conference Silva said, ”Theo had a big impact again, the change we made [Walcott for Kean] had a big impact on our second half. ”Theo was always a really important player for me, he knows that. He is in a good moment and will help us in the next games as well. ”The way we built our attacks [after half-time] was faster and the gaps were clearer. We found the spaces more easily. ”Alex Iwobi was different in the second half, he found the spaces and created more between the lines and was more decisive. “Richarlison did not do enough in the first half but the second half was completely different.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
