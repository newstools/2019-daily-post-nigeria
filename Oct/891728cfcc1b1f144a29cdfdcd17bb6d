Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has admitted that he did not expect Racing Genk’s manager, Felice Mazzu, to start Super Eagles striker, Paul Onuachu in Wednesday night’s Champions League match. Mazzu took everyone by surprise by lining up in a 4-4-2 formation with Onuachu leading the attack and Mbwana Samatta playing behind him. It was a brace from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and one goal each from Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah that saw Liverpool win their first away game in this season’s Champions League. Another Super Eagles striker, Stephen Odey netted a consolation for Genk. Speaking at a post-match press conference, Klopp said, ”It was a smart move to start with such a tall striker. Their 4-4-2 didn’t make such a big difference in itself, because it didn’t change much in their defensive organization. ”But Onuachu was strong as a starter and it was important not to constantly compete with him because then we could make too many mistakes. ”We were on the right track, only giving away too easy chances due to unnecessary ball loss or unnecessary risks in the game.” Onuachu played for 81 minutes before making way for compatriot, Stephen Odey.
