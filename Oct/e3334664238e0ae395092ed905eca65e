Former lawmaker representing Bayelsa East in the upper legislative chamber, Senator Ben Murray-Bruce, has welcomed the Supreme Court’s ruling that dismissed the appeals filed by the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar on Wednesday. The Supreme Court on Wednesday declared President Muhammadu Buhari the authentic winner of the 2019 presidential election, dismissing the appeal of Atiku in which he sought to upturn the validation of the results of the February 2019 elections by the presidential election tribunal. The Supreme Court ruling was unanimous as the seven-man panel led by the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad picked holes in Atiku’s petition. Reacting, Bruce congratulated Buhari on his victory at Supreme Court. The Bayelsa lawmaker, however, urged Buhari to eradicate poverty in Nigeria and grow the economy before 2023. Bruce on his Twitter page wrote: “The Supreme Court has spoken and as the highest court in the land, we cannot but accept its verdict. “ I congratulate President Buhari and ask attention also be focused on healing the nation. “There will be a contest in 2023, but now we need to grow the economy and eradicate poverty!” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
