Edinson Cavani and Thiago Silva could leave Paris Saint-Germain for free at the end of the season, ESPN reports. The two players are both into their final year of contracts and the Ligue 1 giants are yet to offer either a new deal. Cavani, 32, and Silva, 35, are two of the most senior members of the PSG squad. However, Uruguay international Cavani has struggled with injury this campaign and there are younger options ready to replace Silva. It is believed that Cavani has not totally ruled out the possibility of staying and believes he can still convince sporting director Leonardo and the PSG leadership to offer him a new deal. However, Silva has also been left in the dark regarding the club’s plans for him beyond the end of this term.
