Kogi State All Progressives Congress (APC) Governorship Campaign council has declared that only Governor Yahaya Bello can defeat himself in the November 16 governorship election. The Chairman of Media and Publicity of the Bello/Onoja campaign, Kingsley Fanwo, said this in a statement on Sunday. He noted that the groundswell of support across the state has demoralized the opposition PDP ahead of the election. “The Senator Smart Adeyemi-led campaign council is made up of the movers and shakers of Kogi politics. With the arrival of Hon. James Abiodun Faleke, and aspirants who contested with the governor, it has shown that APC will win the coming governorship election massively. “It is a bad time for the PDP and we sincerely sympathize with the main opposition party. They have lost their leaders to the APC; they have lost thousands of their members to the APC, and also recently lost their only senator (Dino Melaye) in the state. He will soon be replaced with a competent senator, in person of Senator Smart Adeyemi. “No matter their grandstanding, we know they are in a big crisis. They are imploding and exploding. We won’t allow them to dictate the direction of our campaign, as we are poised to campaign with the giant strides of the GYB administration. “Our candidate has united the state, provided more educational facilities, revamped our health institutions, built the second largest rice mill in the state and many infrastructural facilities like roads and many others. “We urge our supporters to make peace the fulcrum of our campaign, as the governor abhors violence. We also urge our opponents to sign up to our Peaceful Election Initiative.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
