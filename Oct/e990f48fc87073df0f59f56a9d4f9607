Nobel laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka, has said Nigeria’s educational system is nothing to write home about. He spoke on Sunday at the University of Lagos, Akoka, during the presentation of a play, ‘Folly of Men.’ The event was part of activities commemorating the 90th anniversary of the Government College, Ibadan (GCI). According to the prolific playwright and activist, education in Nigeria is horrific, adding that the country is in trouble. Soyinka, while fielding questions from journalists, commended the GCI Old Boys Association for organising the programme. He said the country’s education was nothing to write home about. “We are in serious trouble, education-wise in this country. Let me not kid you; it’s horrifying. That was why I was happy about the initiative of creating a model school and trying to resurrect this Government College and present it as the ideal. We are really very low, education-wise. “I have learnt how much they (old students association) have done in the last few days and I am very proud of their work. I just hope the government leaves them alone; don’t interfere with them. Let them bring back to everybody’s mind the possibility of what education can be,” the renowned writer said. The President of the GCI Old Boys Association, Dr Wale Babalakin, said the college had fallen into disrepair. He explained that in the last one year, the group had spent over N500m to renovate the school’s structures. “There is nothing called general education. Education must be good. It is better not to provide education than to provide poor education because an half-educated person is a danger to himself and the society. “We have to make conscious efforts to invest in education and create a proper school that will further the development of Nigeria,” he added Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
