The Proprietor of Kogbodi International Schools, Ughelli, Delta State, Mr. Patrick Kogbodi has been released by his abductors at Emevor Community in Isoko North Local Government Area of Delta State. Kogbodi was released on Saturday, October 12 by his abductors after a ten million naira ransom was allegedly paid for his release by his family, DAILY POST can report. The abductors also gave the victim one thousand Naira (N1,000) to transport himself back to his house. At the time our correspondent visited the school of the victim, he was said to be having medical treatment at an undisclosed hospital. However, a relative of the victim who craved anonymity confirmed the report. The source said, “At about 1 am on Saturday, the kidnappers called members of his family to go and drop the ransom of N10m at a place that was shown to them in Benin-City, Edo State.” The source said before the(family)returned from Edo State, he(Kogbodi)had been released and dropped off at Emevor Community. He also said, “The kidnappers gave him N1,000 to transport himself back home while his mobile phone and clothes were seized.” It would be recalled that Kogbodi was abducted by the hoodlums along Aroh road in Ughelli on his way to Church. When contacted, the Delta State Commissioner of Police, CP Adeyinka Adeleke confirmed the report in a telephone chat with our correspondent in Warri. CP Adeleke said,”Yes it is true.
