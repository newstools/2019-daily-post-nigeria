The Kogi State commissioner of Police, Hakeem Busari has cleared the air on why policemen barricaded the house of the former deputy governor of the State Elder, Simon Achuba. CP Busari in an interview with newsmen on Saturday debunked the report that the impeached deputy governor has been put under house arrest, stressing that, the presence of security personnel in the official residence of the Deputy Governor was to prevent looting of government property. According to him, this followed an advice given to Achuba to relocate from the official residence of the deputy governor since he is no longer entitled to stay there. DAILY POST had earlier reported that, there was the presence of fully armed security personnel manning the gate of the official residence of the deputy governor and preventing visitors from going in or allowed out of the house. Busari said that the security personnel at the gate would be there until he finally moves out of the house. The embattled Deputy Governor was impeachment on Friday shortly after the John Baiyeshea seven man committee investigating allegations of gross misconduct against him submitted its report.
