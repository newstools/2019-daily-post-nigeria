The Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has confirmed the postponement of the El Clasico between Barcelona and Real Madrid, due to concerns over political instability in Catalunya. A massive rally is planned for the city of Barcelona on October 26, the same day that the LaLiga champions were scheduled to host their arch-rivals at Camp Nou. Several options were considered by the RFEF, including the possibility of changing the venue to Madrid’s Santiago Bernabeu home. Both sides, however, dismissed that notion in notes sent to Spanish football’s governing body. The two clubs and LaLiga are expected to agree on a new date for the game by next Monday. A proposed date of December 18 has been shut down by LaLiga, due to the fact the game would be played mid-week, with December 7 now looming as a possible alternative willing other games can be rescheduled.
