Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, is hopeful Eden Hazard can build on his impressive display in their 4-2 win over Granada on Saturday. Hazard scored his first goal for the Spanish giants, as Los Blancos stayed top of LaLiga. The former Chelsea star also teed up Luka Modric for the goal of the game just after the hour mark. But the home side let their opponents back into the contest when Darwin Machis converted from the spot after Alphonse Areola brought down Carlos Fernandez. Domingos Duarte set up a tense finale with his close-range finish 13 minutes from time, only for James Rodriguez to kill off the comeback to move Madrid four points clear at the top of La Liga. It was the performance of Hazard that was most encouraging for Zidane, though, the ex-Chelsea man having failed to score or assist in his first five matches. “We need to see Eden like this, playing well and scoring goals,” Zidane told reporters. “He wanted that, he was happy in the dressing room. We hope it’s the first of many for him.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
