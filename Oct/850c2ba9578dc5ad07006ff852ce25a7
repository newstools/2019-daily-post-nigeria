Organisers of Big Brother Naija, BBNaija on Saturday, announced a twist to the reality show. This is coming less than 24hours to the grand finale of BBNaija ‘Pepper Dem’ edition. This is as Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, on his Twitter page, announced that ex-housemates will return to the house tonight. He disclosed that Big Brother will introduce the housemates during the Saturday night party. His tweet read: “BBNaija this night go loud! “Ex-Pepper Dem housemates will party with top 5 finalist.” Five housemates; Mike, Omashola, Frodd, Mercy, and Seyi on Monday escaped to the final week as Diane got evicted. One of the housemates with the highest vote will on Sunday emerge as the winner of N60m.
