Manchester United Manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is set for a triple boost with the return of three key players, for Sunday’s huge showdown with arch-rivals, Liverpool. Paul Pogba, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Luke Shaw are all set to return for the Old Trafford clash, according to the UK Mirror. Forward Anthony Martial is also understood to be in contention to make the 18-man squad. Solskjaer is desperate for the return of a core of his established players, with the Red Devils having endured their worst start to a league campaign for 30 years. United are down in 12th place, 15 points behind leaders Liverpool, who boast a 100 per cent record. Defeat against Jurgen Klopp’s men will further pile more pressure on the Norwegian.
