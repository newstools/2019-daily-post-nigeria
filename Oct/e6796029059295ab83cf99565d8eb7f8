Manchester United’s recently-published financial result, shows the club has an annual wage bill of around £332million, a record-breaking figure in Premier League history, the DailyMail reports. The club has also spent close to £1billion in acquiring talents, since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down in 2013. United continue to pay eye-watering sums to their top players in recent years, despite their woes on the pitch. Goalkeeper David de Gea recently signed a new £375,000-a-week deal, while Paul Pogba earns £290,000-a-week. The £332m figure also includes seven months of wages paid to Alexis Sanchez, who earns £400,000 a week at Old Trafford. Inter Milan, who took Sanchez on loan this summer, agreed to pay close to £4.5m of the Chile international’s £21m annual salary, meaning United are still having to subsidise a significant portion of his wages. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men are currently 12th on the table, two points above relegation places.
