The presiding Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ Gospel Church, Adewale Giwa has advised Nigerians to stop voting for politicians until things are done properly and decently. Giwa, who stated this in a statement to DAILY POST on Tuesday said current and past political events in the country had indicated that voters no longer determine who wins an election. He said,” An avaricious person is very greedy and selfish. He can do all things to get into position without thinking of what he can do to develop the state or the country he is governing. “You can see so many cases in Nigeria where the vote of the masses no longer determines who wins an election. A case study of the last presidential election where it was widely reported to have marred by heavy gunfire, killings, technology failures among others. “Despite it was reported that voting processes were disrupted by hoodlums across the country, politicians still went and rigged themselves into power. The most disturbing situation is that they would even write figures for themselves before elections. “The reason why the country is producing failed leaders today is that politicians continue to rig themselves into power, and they don’t care about the sufferings of the people. When you speak the truth, they would put you behind bars in a big way. “Tell me when and how are we going to get it right if they fail to address this situation? Those who are supposed to be fighting for the common people through their voices are being silent. “As a man of God, you have every reason to speak the truth to power or whoever is not behaving well. As I continue to pray for the development of the country, I shall continue to speak the truth as well,” Giwa stated.
