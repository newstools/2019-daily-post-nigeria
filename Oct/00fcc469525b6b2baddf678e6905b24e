Chelsea loanee, Victor Moses, has returned to Fenerbahce’s first-team training ahead of their Super Lig clash against Denizlispor on Sunday, according to Goal. The former Super Eagles winger has been out of action for Fenerbahce since August due to injury. Moses sustained a muscle injury in Fenerbahce’s 5-0 victory over Gaziantep. He looks set to play again for the yellow Canaries this weekend after missing seven consecutive matches for the club. The 28-year-old helped Ersun Yanal’s men to win the Turkish Cup last season. Fenerbahce are currently in fifth position on the log with 11 points from seven games this term.
