The leadership crisis rocking Edo State chapter of the National Union of Road Transport Workers of Nigeria (NURTWN) has further deepened as members have petitioned Chief Odion Olayes’ refusal to obey court judgment to the national body. In a petition made available to DAILY POST in Benin city, the state capital by Mr Saturday Oamen who is laying claim to the chairmanship position, the union stipulates a maximum of two terms of four years each for all elective officers of the union. In the petition, he alleged that the National Industrial Court, Akure’s decision in their March 13, 2018 judgment removed Odion Olaye as the state chairman of the union. According to him, ‘ Olaye was first elected in 2003 and ought to have finished his two tenure of eight years each in 2011. He has spent nine over fifteen years. It is worrisome that, in spite of the court judgment, he still holds on to the office. “On the strength of the said judgment, with suit no NICN/BEN/12/2017, we are by this letter directing him to immediately vacate office as the state chairman of the union in strict obedience to the court order which state inter-allia” our union is a creation of the law and a law abiding organization that believes in the rule of law. We were surprised to see on the 16th October, 2019 as we saw the national chairman, Chief Baruwa on TV who incidentally was the national treasurer at the time paying a courtesy call on the state governor purportedly introducing chief Olaye as the state chairman.” He, however, called on the national leadership of the union to obey the court judgment by swearing him in as the substantive chairman.
