Three Nigerians and other foreign nationals on Tuesday suffered fresh xenophobic attacks in different locations of Witbank, Mpumanlaga Provinces, South Africa. The National Spokesperson of the Nigeria Union, South Africa (NUSA), Mr Odefa Ikele, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the attacks started in the early hours of the morning. Ikele said, “Groups made up of community members and taxi drivers went to different areas in Witbank attacking foreign-owned businesses and foreigners. “Three Nigerians are injured, but no death case for now. Some of our nationals are seeking refuge at Witbank Police Station,’’ he said. According to him, the affected Nigerians are still taking refuge at the police station at Witbank.
He added that the details of the incident were still sketchy but the Police in the area have intervened and warned people to stay away from the Central Business District in the town. Tuesday’s attacks are coming on the heels of efforts by Presidents Muhammadu Buhari and Cyril Ramaphosa to ensure they found amicable and lasting solution to the xenophobia in the latter’s country.
