The Chairman, Senate Committee on Army, Ali Ndume, has revealed that Boko Haram insurgents have killed 847 soldiers from 2013 to date. Ndume also revealed that “the deceased officers were buried in the military cemetery located in Maiduguri, Borno capital.” The lawmaker made the revelation after a visit to Borno by committee members, according to the Nation. The Borno-born politician, however, declared that the figure did not include soldiers killed by the insurgents but buried in other military cemeteries. He said that his committee found out that soldiers were under-equipped to confront the insurgents. According to Ndume, the number of soldiers confronting insurgents was inadequate. He called on the government to recruit more troops. The lawmaker disclosed that the Senate Panel was already investigating allegations that some non-governmental organizations were working with Boko Haram.
