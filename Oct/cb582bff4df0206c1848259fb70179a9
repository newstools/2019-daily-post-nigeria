Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr has said that Victor Osimhen would still be his first choice striker ahead of Tammy Abraham had the England born Chelsea star chosen to play for Nigeria. Abraham turned down the chance to represent Nigeria in preference for England. Abraham made his competitive debut for England in their 1-2 loss to Czech Republic last night. The game means he is no longer eligible for Nigeria despite lasting a little over three minutes on the pitch following his introduction as a substitute. Rohr insist that the striker who has scored seven goals for Chelsea this season would have probably played same substitute role for Nigeria if he had agreed to switch allegiance. ”Abraham would have improved our team because he is a quality player but he still wouldn’t have picked an automatic shirt to start,” Rohr was quoted by Own goal. “Osimhen now has it and he will have to earn it. Like others who switched allegiance did, the likes of Tyronne Ebuehi and Ola Aina. “His loss is not something we can’t do without. We wish him well with England.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
