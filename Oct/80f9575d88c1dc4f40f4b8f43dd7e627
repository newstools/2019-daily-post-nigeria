A Civil Rights group, Coalition for Good Governance and Change, CGG, has alleged that some international Non-Governmental Organisation, NGO, were passing classified military information to Boko Haram sect, thereby making the war against insurgency difficult. CGG, thereby, called for a probe of some of those international NGOs working in Borno State. The coalition said the activities of some international NGOs in the northeastern part of the nation were becoming very worrisome. A statement by the convener of the group, Princess Ajibola, said the activities of some of the NGOs encourage the terrorists to continue carrying out attacks against Nigerians, as well as help advance the ability of the terrorist group to recruit new fighters. The coalition, therefore, urged the National Assembly to take a definite stance against this threat to the nation.
