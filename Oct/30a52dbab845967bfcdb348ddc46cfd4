winner of Big Brother Africa (BBA) All-Stars edition, Uti Nwachukwu, has suggested what five final housemates should do with the grand prize of N60m. Five housemates; Mike, Omashola, Frodd, Mercy, and Seyi on Monday escaped to the final week as Diane got evicted. One of the housemates with the highest vote will on Sunday emerge as the winner of N60m. However, Uti took to his twitter page suggesting that housemates share the grand prize of N60. He added that during his time he shared part of his money among top three Uti wrote: “I actually shared my prize money. I gave 5k dollars each to 3 of the top 5 housemates of my season. Ask them. “Kai this is so hard. I wish we could share the BBNaija prize worth amongst the remaining housemates, it for sweet my belle “12M to Mercy, 12M to Omashola, 12M to Frodd, 12M to Seyi and off course
12M to Mike. “Then the Ultimate winner will get the car, it would have been super.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
