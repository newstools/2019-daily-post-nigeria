Anambra State Commissioner for Works, Mr Marcel Ifejiofor, on Friday allegedly locked out staff of the Ministry who reported late to work. The commissioner, according to a source, said it was a way of instilling discipline in the state’s workforce, and making them to know that it was not business as usual. “I wonder why the staff of works’ Ministry will not report early to work in order to reciprocate government’s gesture that has shown adequate concern for their welfare. This is to instill discipline. “Government has done a lot to make the workforce happy. What they owe Government is to be at their duty posts when they should, to reciprocate the gesture.’’ According to Ifejiofor, no staff will be spared the punishment irrespective of their positions. “The list of the defaulting staff will be forwarded to the office of the Head of Service (HOS) and the Ministry will issue queries as a disciplinary measure too. “Status does not matter. What matters is doing the right thing at the right time,’’ the commissioner insisted.
