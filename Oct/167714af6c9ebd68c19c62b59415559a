Jose Mourinho felt Manchester United had both “heart” and “a game plan”, following their 1-1 draw with Liverpool on Sunday. The Red Devils led for a large period of the game after Marcus Rashford’s first half opener, but Adam Lallana struck a late equaliser for the visitors. Former United boss, Mourinho, claimed his successor Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would be feeling “proud and a little bit frustrated” after what felt like two points dropped. Mourinho told Sky Sports: “It’s hard to say. I think they did something to hurt them, and Jurgen, in the last 20 minutes of the game, he tried to do something. “He tried to give the team different problems for United to resolve. More people through the middle, more occupation of spaces in the box, more projection of the full-backs. “He gave them problems and he got a reward from it, but at the same time I feel that Ole and United, after such a fantastic effort, I think they may feel a bit disappointed with one mistake and two points that they lost. “In the beginning of the game I was asking United for heart. They had it, but they had more than that. “They were organised, they had a plan. You can agree or disagree, but they had a game plan, they stuck to it. “At half-time Graeme (Souness) was commenting to us the problem was if they could keep that defensive intensity for 90 minutes, and they couldn’t. “I think at the end of the game, Liverpool were on top of them, so probably the result is fair. “But if I was Ole I would be proud, and a little bit frustrated, because I think the boys, they gave everything.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
