The Head of Chamber, Mba Ukweni and Associates and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) Ntufam Mba Ukweni, has called on Nigerians not to celebrate the presentation of the 2020 budget proposal by President Muhammadu Buhari. Ntufam Mba, who spoke with DAILY POST on Thursday lamented the non-implementation of past budgets in the country. He regretted that Nigerians had seen several lofty budgets being churned out but implementation would always be a major challenge. “We have always had budgets. It is not the proposal that is usually our problem in Nigeria. It is the implementation of those budgets. Whichever way you look at it, budgets presented by various ministries often come with lofty ideas. “But you discovered that in most cases, over 10% of the budget is not usually implemented. How do you expect the economy to grow? “If the budgets are implemented to the later, then, there will be a turnaround in the economy. Social lives of the people will change. The educational sector will improve; and the security system will take better shape. “But the problem we find in Nigeria is that the budget is usually presented to the National Assembly and passed, but no concrete thing is done to bring it into effective implementation and usefulness to the citizens.
