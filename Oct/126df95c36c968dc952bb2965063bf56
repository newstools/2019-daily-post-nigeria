Juventus goalkeeper, Ginaluigi Buffon’s agent, Silvano Martina, has revealed the age when his client will finally retire from football. According to Martina, the 41-year-old shot-stopper can continue playing until the age of 44, before perhaps moving into coaching. Buffon returned to Juventus last summer on a one-year deal after a single season at Paris Saint-Germain. Speaking in an interview with Sportitalia, Martina said: “Buffon made the right move returning to Juventus because he is still competitive and strong. “I think he’ll have the chances to play this season and I believe he can play for another couple of years, take it up to the age of 44. “I personally advised him to train as a coach for when he hangs up his gloves, as I think he could give his all in that role. He might enjoy it, too.” Buffon will hope to feature for Juventus when they take on Bologna this weakened in the Serie A fixture.
