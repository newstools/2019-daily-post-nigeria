He said the unprecedented seizures were made as a result of intelligence and determination on the NCS operatives in making the Zone unbearable for smugglers and appreciated the efforts of other sister agencies, especially the Department of State Services for giving them intelligence in making some of the seizures. Olugboyega pleaded with Community Leaders to talk to their people to support the efforts of the Officers/Men of the Service in suppressing smuggling in the Country. “The ongoing closure of borders otherwise known as “Border Drill” is to enforce compliant of ECOWAS Trade Agreement/Protocol among member Nations’ which has started yielding positively with unprecedented rise in revenue generation, reduction in insecurity, wealth and Job creation,” he said. He warned that: “To those unscrupulous elements, I want them to know that there is no hidden place for them and whatever their strategy, we will always be ahead.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
