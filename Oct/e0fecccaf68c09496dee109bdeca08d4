First Lady, Mrs. Aisha Buhari, has revealed her plans for the future as Nigeria turns 59 today. Aisha, who has not returned to the country since the completion of the Hajj in Saudi Arabia as a result of the speculations that the First Lady is unable to take charge of things within the Villa lately, reiterated her commitment to serve the country by helping the less privilege. In her Independence Day message to Nigerians, she also called on other well-meaning individuals and groups to do more in the areas of health, education, empowerment and protection of women and children. The First Lady tweeted, “On the occasion of the 59th independence anniversary of our dear nation, I wish to restate my resolve to touch more lives through Aisha Buhari Foundation and Future Assured Programs. “I, however, continue my call on more privileged Nigerians, the private sector and NGO’s to do more in the areas of education, health, empowerment and protection of women and children. It is my earnest belief that the future is bright. “Happy Independence Day Nigeria.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
