Cristiano Ronaldo could be set to have a stadium named after him, as Sporting Lisbon considered rebranding Estadio Jose Alvalade. The club’s home venue is currently named after founder, Jose Alvalade, and has been known as such since 1956. However, current president Frederico Varandas is considering a change. Ronaldo joined the club in 1997 as a 12-year-old and worked his way up to their first-team, from where he signed for Manchester United. While his senior career didn’t last long at Sporting, Ronaldo has left a lasting legacy at the club, with Varandas confirming they are considering renaming Estadio Jose Alvalade after him. “It is an idea that we do not put aside and one of which we would obviously be very proud of. “Cristiano is – and always will be – one of the greatest symbols of our club’s history. We are proud to be associated with Cristiano Ronaldo and that the name of the best footballer in the world is combined with Sporting. “As far as our young people are concerned, we are trying to keep his example inside the academy,” Varandas told Tuttosport.
