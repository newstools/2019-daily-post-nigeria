The governor of Ebonyi State, Chief David Umahi, yesterday, explained why he ordered for the immediate relocation of herders resident at the new government house, located at the centenary city, the state capital. DAILY POST gathered that the order for the relocation of the herders may not be unconnected with the insinuation making the rounds in the state that the herders would attack the governor, especially as he plans to pack into the new government house by December 2019. The governor who spoke to journalists in Abakaliki through the secretary to the state government, SSG, Dr. Kenneth Ugbala, was reacting to the allegation that the herders are stranded in the state. According to him: “through the instrumentality of our government, we are managing the issues of herdsmen. Recall that the herdsmen that are presently staying close to the centenary city (new government house) were brought from Igboagu community, when there was crisis, of a herder who started attacking people in that community and even kill some. “To ensure that such problem do not escalate, the governor in his wisdom relocated one family to protect their lives in the developing government lodge and now development has gotten to that place, and peace has returned. The governor in his effort has made sure that they go back to their regional place. “We just had meeting, and it was agreed and it is under control. There are no challenges and they will be taken back to where they came from. In Ebonyi state, we don’t have issues with herders. We are living very peacefully, because we proactively solved the problems they had in that place. “That’s why we can tell you that there is no security challenges regarding the herdsmen or whosoever in Ebonyi state. We have never had any serious crisis between the herders and people of the state” he stated.
