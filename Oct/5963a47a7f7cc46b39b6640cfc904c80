President Muhammadu Buhari has declared that any Federal Government worker not captured on the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) by Oct. 31 would not be paid salary. He made the disclosure to the joint session of the National Assembly in Abuja on Tuesday. Buhari also warned that all agencies of government must obtain permission and follow due process as they embark on any recruitment exercise. He said: “I have directed the stoppage of the salary of any Federal Government staff that is not captured on the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) platform by the end of October 2019. ”All agencies must obtain the necessary approvals before embarking on any fresh recruitment and any contraventions of these directives shall attract severe sanctions,” he said. He said total overhead cost for the year 2020 stood at over N400 billion, with additional provisions for the newly created ministries. “Overhead costs are projected at N426.6 billion in 2020. Additional provisions were made only for the newly created Ministries,” he said. ”I am confident that the benefits of these new Ministries as it relates to efficient and effective service delivery to our citizens significantly outweigh their budgeted costs. “That said, the respective Heads of Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs) must ensure strict adherence to government regulations regarding expenditure control measures. ”The proliferation of Zonal, State and Liaison Offices by Federal Ministries, Departments and Agencies (‘MDAs’), with attendant avoidable increase in public expenditure, will no longer be tolerated,” the president said.
