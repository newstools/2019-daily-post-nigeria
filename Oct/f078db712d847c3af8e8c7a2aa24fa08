The House of Representatives has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to stop the planned operation positive identification. The House, therefore, resolved to mandate the Committee on Army to interface with the Army Chief to develop a people-friendly strategy to combat crimes. The decision followed a motion of urgent public importance moved by the Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu. Moving the motion, Elumelu described the proposal as “infringement on the rights of Nigerians.” He said further that it will be “an indirect state of emergency if allowed to take place,” adding that the “Plan contravenes sections Section 217 sub 2(c,d).” The sections read, “The Federation shall, subject to an Act of the National Assembly made in that behalf, equip and maintain the armed forces as may be considered adequate and effective for the purpose of – “(b) maintaining its territorial integrity and securing its borders from violation on land, sea, or air; “(c) suppressing insurrection and acting in aid of civil authorities to restore order when called upon to do so by the President, but subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by an Act of the National Assembly; and “(d) performance such other functions as may be prescribed by an Act of the National Assembly.” Also supporting the motion, the Deputy Minority Leader, Toby Okechukwu, said the proposal is not within the mandate of the army. “It is not part of their mandate, we have the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) and we have the security apparatus, unfortunately, we have been under siege by Boko Haram. “They are simply belabouring themselves with jobs that do not concern them. What defect is it supposed to cure? We have to interrogate this through the committee on Army.” The Motion was unanimously adopted when put to vote by the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila.
