It was like a scene in one of the Nollywood movies when residents of Akure, the Ondo State capital, trooped to hospital road axis of the town to catch a glimpse of a corpse, which had allegedly not decayed 41 years after it was buried. The incident, which has been termed as a “mystery” occurred on Wednesday when the corpse of a man identified as Baba Boboye was exhumed at a two-storey building, at Alafia Tayo Roundabout, opposite Mega Primary School, Akure. It was gathered that the corpse was exhumed for relocation by his family due to the ongoing road reconstruction within the State Specialist Hospital axis. According to sources, everyone became curious when the coffin appeared very neat as if it was recently buried before they were prompted to open it when it was discovered that the 41-year-old corpse was still very fresh and intact. It was also discovered that all the accessories he was buried with had not been tampered with including his clothing. The corpse was later moved to Ajegunle, along Ijoka where it was reburied.
