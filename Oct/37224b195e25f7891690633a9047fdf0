The Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, has reacted to the Appeal Court ruling that upheld an earlier decision by the State and National Assembly Election Petition Tribunal which sacked Senator Dino Melaye. The Governor commended the Friday’s judgment of the Court of Appeal which nullified the Kogi West Senatorial election and ordered a fresh poll. Bello pointed out that the judgment vindicated his earlier position that the opposition Peoples Democratic Party manipulated the election. Bello’s statement was titled, “Kogi West Appeal Court Verdict: Attestation that Judiciary is Impartial,’ and signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Onogwu Muhammed. The statement added, “For upholding the petition by Senator Smart Adeyemi of the All Progressives Congress and ordering that a fresh election be conducted by the Independent National Electoral Commission in the constituency, the tribunal, led by Justice AO Chijioke and the Appeal Court have jointly proved to the world that the people’s mandate was stolen in the last Kogi West Senatorial election. “The courts did not decide in a vacuum but acted on the basis of the merits and demerits of the case before them. “The Appeal Court and the entire judiciary, therefore, deserve our commendation for further strengthening the democratic and electioneering processes in Nigeria.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
