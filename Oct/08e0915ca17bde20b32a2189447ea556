Ballon D’Or organisers, France Football, have revealed why Neymar was left out their 30-man shortlist for the award. Neymar was excluded along with last year’s winner Luka Modric and Harry Kane. France Football have now claimed they snubbed the 27-year-old, after what they described as a “black year”. It is the first time since 2010 that the Paris Saint-Germain forward has failed to make the shortlist. The organising body gave eight reasons for his exclusion in a statement. They are: January 23 – Metatarsal injury
March 6 – Abusing match official after Man Utd match
April 27 – Pushing a supporter
June 6 – Ankle injury ahead of Copa America
August 9 – Cleared of rape allegation
Transfer window – Failed move to Barcelona
September 14 – Jeered by PSG fans
October 13 – Another injury on international duty
Neymar was absent with that metatarsal injury as PSG exited the Champions League to Manchester United in the Round of 16, though he did help his side win the French title. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
