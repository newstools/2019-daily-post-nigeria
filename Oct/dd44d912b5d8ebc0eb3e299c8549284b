The Buhari government has announced plans to reintroduce toll gates across Nigeria. The government of ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo had scrapped tolls on federal roads in 2004. Babatunde Fashola, Minister of Works, told State House correspondents at the end of the Federal Executive Council meeting on Wednesday that there is no law against toll plazas. He added that some of the logistics being worked out before the reintroduction include acquiring more lands that will provide up to 10-lane plazas. The minister also disclosed that the council had approved additional N15.765 billion for two roads in the country. The roads are Suleja-Minna-Lambata road and Ibadan-Lagere-Ilesa bypass. He said the two roads contracts approved on Wednesday were upward review from initially approved rates. On the 101km Suleja-Minna-Lambata road, he said FEC also approved additional N12.6 billion, while additional N3.165 billion was approved for the Ibadan-Lagere-Ilesa bypass.
