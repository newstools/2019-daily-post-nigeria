Massimiliano Allegri is close to taking over as Manchester United manager, Tuttosport reports. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has endured a difficult start to the season, with the Red Devils sitting in 12th place ahead of this weekend’s home fixture against table-toppers Liverpool. United’s hierarchy are ready to act and are closing in on the appointment of former Juventus boss, Allegri, in a deal worth £6.5m a year. Allegri wants to bring former Liverpool midfielder, Emre Can and striker Mario Mandzukic with him, as he plans an overhaul at Old Trafford. Last season, Jose Mourinho was sacked by Manchester United before Christmas and there is the possibility that Solskjaer could suffer the same fate. Following United’s latest defeat, away at Newcastle before the international break, talks with Allegri are said to have intensified.
