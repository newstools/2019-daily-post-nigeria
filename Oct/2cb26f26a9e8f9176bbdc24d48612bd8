Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, has vowed to step on toes in a bid to make the state great and set it on a path of sustainable development.
Makinde said his administration will not shy away from taking hard decisions that will be beneficial to the state.
The governor stated this while performing two functions in his office and was contained in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Taiwo Adisa.
He said, “I have seen people come to me and said I should not do some certain things or take certain decisions because of second term. Those that are interested in second term should wait, at least till 2022. For now, we should do the job the people have committed to our hands and do things that will place Oyo State on the path of greatness.”
The governor, while receiving the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kogi State, Mr. Musa Wada, cautioned politicians against the crave for a second term. “The people are the sole determinants of the fate of the politicians. Fresh term, second term are all linked to what we have for the people.
“During the first term, you make promises to the people and once you start ticking those boxes, the people can always decide that they want you to come in first and later say they want you to continue,” Makinde said.
