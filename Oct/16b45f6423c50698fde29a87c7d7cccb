Bournemouth goalkeeper, Joseph Oluwabusola, has his eyes set on securing the starting spot, when the Golden Eaglets take on Hungary at the 2019 FIFA U17 World Cup on Saturday, October 26, according to AllNigeriaSoccer. Oluwabusola was born in Essex, England and first visited Nigeria in 2018, for an U17 training camp. It is under that, he opted to represent the West African nation over England, because he is keen to know his roots and add value to Nigerian football. Oluwabusola has adjusted quickly after the initial culture shock. He is now able to communicate with his team-mates in a mixture of local dialects – Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba and Pidgin English.
