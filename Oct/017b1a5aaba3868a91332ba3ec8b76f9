She arrived at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport at 4.30am via a British Airways flight.” The statement said the wife of the President, on arrival confirmed that she was fully rejuvenated to continue the work of improving the health and well-being of women, children and other vulnerable Nigerians. She used the opportunity to thank her husband, family and well-wishers for their support and encouragement. On hand to receive her were wives of present and former governors and many associates. This is coming at a time when reports had it that Buhari was set to marry another wife. Reports had it that Buhari was to marry the Honourable Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster and Management, Sadiya Umar Farouq, yesterday, but it never happened. This came following the continued absence of Aisha, who has been out of the Presidential Villa since her trips to Saudi Arabia and UK. However, Buhari’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, dispelled that Buhari was picking another wife, stressing that the “rumour was a deceptive manoeuvre by those who fabricated the news.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
