Barcelona have reportedly tabled €8m for Nigerian-born Germany junior international, Karim Adeyemi. Adeyemi currently plays for FC Red Bull Salzburg of Austria and has been on the radar of Barca Youth chief, Patrick Kluivert. Mundo Deportivo reports that Barcelona feel it will be a good move to go for the 17-year-old striker, who has been likened to Ansu Fati who only last month graduated to the senior team. Fati became the youngest player in the history of La Liga to score and assist in the same match, at the age of 16 years and 318 days. Fati scored in the 2nd minute and assisted Frenkie de Jong’s goal in the 7th minute of an eventual 5–2 home win against Valencia. He also made his Champions League debut in a 0–0 away draw against Borussia Dortmund, becoming the youngest player to feature for Barcelona in the competition at the age of 16 years and 321 days. Adeyemi was born in Munich, Germany to a Nigerian father and Romanian mother. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
