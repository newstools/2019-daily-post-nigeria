Former Manchester United striker, Mark Robins, has insisted that the board must be patient and back Ole Gunnar Solskjaer if they want to see success in the long-term. The United boss has come under intense scrutiny after a poor start to the Premier League season. Three defeats in their opening eight matches have left United 12th in the Premier League table with only two wins to their name. But former front man Robins, now manager of League One outfit Coventry City, believes that Solskjaer must be given plenty of time to implement his philosophy on the playing squad. “What he’s trying to do is reinstall the values that he felt as a player and that were there under Sir Alex,” he told Sky Sports. “He needs time to do that. If you remember when Sir Alex took over, it was six years before that started to take an effect. “I don’t think you get that times these days but I think the board will be patient. As long as they can see things moving forward in the right way they will be patient. “Clearly, you need to get results alongside that. Ole knows that but the noises coming out of there and what is being said, they seem happy, the players seem happy, it seems a happier camp. “Things can turn quickly but you need results to maintain it. I hope he gets that time and he gets the backing in the transfer market because it’s going to take a long time to get them back to where they were. “There is a danger of trying to chase the teams above you and there are a few teams above them but certainly Liverpool and Manchester City, you’ve got to get on with what you’re doing and plan for your club. “Hopefully, he’ll get the time to achieve his goals.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
