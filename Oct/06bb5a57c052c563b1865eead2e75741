A mack truck with registration number, Rivers BNY 137 XA, heading towards Calabar, lost control and ran into a fuel station, killing three people and injuring others. The accident occurred at about 7:10 am Wednesday along Urua Ekpa junction Uyo. The driver of the truck who apparently ‘disappeared’ from the scene immediately after the accident was nowhere to be found as at the time of this report. An eyewitness who pleaded anonymity said the truck driver was trying to avoid a commercial tricycle (Keke) rider who recklessly crossed the road”. The inability of the driver of the heavy-duty vehicle to effectively apply its breaks on sighting the sudden crossing of the Keke may have caused him to lose control as he was left with the only option of veering into the fuel station which had a sizable crowd of commuters standing by the fringes to catch buses to their various destinations. The victims as at the time of this report were yet to be identified. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
