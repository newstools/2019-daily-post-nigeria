Members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) otherwise known as Shi’ites, on Saturday, commemorated the 40th day of the alleged assassination of their members by policemen during the recent ashura procession when the sect clashed with the police in Azare town, Katagum Local Government Area of Bauchi State. The event, which held at Fodiya Islamic school Azare, was attended by Shi’ite leaders from other local governments and states. In an interview with the DAILY POST, leader of the sect in Katagum Local Government, Malam Aliyu Abubakar Dawud, said the event was organized to remember and mourn their slain members. He alleged that the police had some months back killed three of their members, injured 30 others and detained seven while they were demonstrating against the assassination of prophet Muhammad’s grandson, Imam Hussain, during his lifetime. He condemned the alleged attack on the sect during the procession, claiming that they were unarmed and not violent when police allegedly molested them. He said they would visit the grave of the deceased persons immediately after the gathering to offer special prayers for the repose of their souls. DAILY POST reports that the event was attended by Shi’ite leader from Yobe State, Malam Abdullahi Siminti, and other local governments of Bauchi State. However, police did not confirm killing any sect member in the state but only admitted that there was a clash between them and the shi’ites where some people were injured. DAILY POST reports that police had place a nationwide ban on street protests or processions by the sect following their proscription by the Federal Government.
