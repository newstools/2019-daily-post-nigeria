Olivier Giroud has admitted he could leave Chelsea in January. The France striker said earlier this week, that he was unhappy being a reserve player at Stamford Bridge. Giroud has made just three Premier League appearances this term, including only one start. “I’m going to fight for my place in Chelsea. The coach knows it. And we will make the decision in January. “If I want to leave Chelsea? Not necessarily. But if I need to make a choice… I have some beautiful years in front of me. I’m 33, I still have legs and a good healthy lifestyle and I feel good physically. “I want to have fun and want to play more games. Chelsea is my priority, but if in the end I’m forced to make a choice, I will do it as when I left Arsenal,” Giroud said following France’s draw with Turkey on Monday. He added: “[Lampard] will almost certainly watch the matches. In any case, I am going back to Chelsea pumped up.” Giroud scored France’s only goal in Monday’s 1-1 draw, his 38th international strike.
