Nigel Winterburn has revealed a move to Chelsea “fell apart”, before he secured a move to Arsenal. The Gunners signed Winterburn from Wimbledon in 1987 in a deal worth £350,000. The left-back went on to make over 400 appearances for the club, helping Arsenal win three league titles and two FA Cups. “I don’t really talk about it a lot, but two weeks before that [signing for Arsenal] I had gone to Chelsea for talks. “They wanted to sign me but that all fell apart,” Winterburn told the Football Ramble Daily podcast. Asked why his move to Chelsea fell through, Winterburn responded: “I have no idea. I tend to find with me, that with life, if things don’t go well, the best way to deal with it is to block it out. “Maybe I asked for too much money! A few days after that they signed Tony Dorigo, so they were obviously eyeing up us both, and maybe he was the better option at the time.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
