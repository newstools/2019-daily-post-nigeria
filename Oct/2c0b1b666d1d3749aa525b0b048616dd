Former Manchester United and Chelsea coach, Jose Mourinho, was spotted at the Emirates Stadium on Thursday night, AllNigeriaSoccer reports. The Portuguese watched on, as Arsenal came from behind to record a 3-2 win against Vitória de Guimaraes in the Europa League. It is unclear if Mourinho was on a scouting mission, or if he was invited by the powers that be at Arsenal. However, his visit comes with Gunners’ boss Unai Emery, under pressure, following a series of indifferent results. Arsenal lost 1-0 at Sheffield United on Monday and were 2-1 down to Vitoria, until Nicolas Pepe was introduced from the bench and scored a pair of brilliant free-kicks. A few supporters were also seen carrying placards asking for Emery to be sacked at the game.
