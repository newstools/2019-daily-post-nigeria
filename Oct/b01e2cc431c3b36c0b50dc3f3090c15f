Portugal captain, Cristiano Ronaldo, reached 700 career goals in official matches, during their 2-1 loss to Ukraine in a Euro 2020 qualifier on Monday. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner converted a penalty in the 72nd minute, after a Ukraine player was judged to have handled a long-range shot in the box. Ronaldo is the sixth player to achieve the feat, following ex-Germany striker Gerd Muller, Hungary legend Ferenc Puskas, Brazil’s Pele and Romario and the Czech Republic’s Josef Bican. The only other active player close to breaching the 700-goal mark, is Barcelona and Argentina star Lionel Messi, who has 672. Ronaldo, 34, made his international debut at the age of 18 in a 1-0 victory over Kazakhstan on August 20, 2003. He scored his first goal in the opening match of Euro 2004, which Portugal lost 2-1 to eventual winners Greece.
