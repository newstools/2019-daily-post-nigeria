The trial of journalist, Agba Jalingo, has commenced at the Federal High Court in Calabar, Cross River State capital. The Presiding Judge, Justice Simon Amobeda, had on October 23, 2019 granted leave for the prosecution to amend his charges. The initial charges preferred against the accused was bordered on terrorism, treasonable felony, cultism and attempt to topple the Cross River State Government The charge amongst others was amended to be an act of terrorism perpetrated against the Federal Government. Consequently, the accused, Jalingo pleaded “not guilty” to the four charges. The prosecution Counsel, Dennis Tarhemba, a Deputy Superintendent of Police asked for a short date to continue the trial. But, the defense led by Adeyinka Olumide-fusika SAN, argued that there was no reason for adjournment as the trial has suffered so many adjournments for commencement of trial. After rising twice on the matter, Justice Amobeda granted the prayer of the prosecution for adjournment and dismissed the prayer for bail by the defense. In his ruling, Justice Amobeda said that the letter of the prosecution to the Court informing it of his appearance at the Court of Appeal was dispensed of due to his appearance. He held that the prosecution has not unduly asked for adjournment. On the prayer for bail, the court ruled that the authorities cited by the defense counsel existed before the administration of criminal justice act was signed into law. Justice Amobeda said the circumstances do not warrant for the granting of bail. He said the adjournment suffered were partly contributed to by the defense and that by provision of the law, the number of adjournments requested for has not been exceeded.
