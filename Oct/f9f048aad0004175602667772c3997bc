Super Eagles head coach, Gernot Rohr, has charged his players to give hundred percent performance when they face Brazil in an international friendly fixture on Sunday afternoon in Singapore. Rohr also said that the match against the Selecao will prepare his players’ mind and confidence ahead of their African Cup of Nations qualifier against the Benin Republic next month. Rohr’s men head to the game following a 2-2 draw with Ukraine in their last friendly game, while Brazil played a 1-1 draw with Senegal on Thursday. “I know Nigerians will want us to beat Brazil or judge us with the game. But my own is that the match is good to prepare their minds and build confidence,” Rohr told SportingLife. “You know playing Brazil is a grade-A international friendly match, the boys must give their 100% and we hope for a good result. “So far the players are in high spirits and everybody is preparing and looking forward to the match.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
