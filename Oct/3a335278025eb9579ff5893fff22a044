Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku, on Thursday, said the state recorded over 100 cases of kidnapping between January and September this year. Ishaku disclosed this in Jalingo, the state capital, at a one-day training for the conduct of “Operation Ayem-Akpatuma II“ by the 3 Division, Nigerian Army, Jos. The Governor said, “From January to September, 100 cases of kidnapping were recorded and ransom ranging from N500,000 to N5m collected on each case. “So many families prefer to handle cases of kidnapping themselves without involving security agencies, so the records may be higher. “But from the information available from security agencies, at least 100 cases of kidnappings were recorded from January to September and over N250m collected from poor families. “This disturbing situation call for government to support security agencies to tackle this growing security concern. “In view of this we have donated 26 motorcycles and two Hilux vans to support the army in their ‘Operation Ayem Akpatuma II in the State’,” he said. Earlier, Nuhu Angbazo, General Officer commanding (GOC), 3 Division, Jos, said the training was to engender cooperation among security agencies and ensure success of the operation. Angbazo said during the operation, “criminal elements would be confronted, headlong”. He commended the governor for his support toward achieving the objective of the operation. Angbazo said that the operation was launched in Taraba, Benue, Nasarawa and Kogi states simultaneously, to flush out criminals and halt violence of all kinds.
