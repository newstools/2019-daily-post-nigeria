The Nigeria Police have discovered an illegal reformation home in Adamawa State.
The Police, in a raid, freed 15 inmates of the home located at a suburb named Wuro-Hausa in Yola Town of Yola South Local Government Area of the state.
According to a source, the Police found the 15 persons illegally held in the home by an old man who had young people serving as his monitoring agents.
The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Suleiman Ngoroje, hinted DAILY POST Wednesday afternoon that there was such a development, but he declined giving the details, saying the state Commissioner of Police, Audu Madaki, and other security chiefs were in a meeting with Governor Umaru Fintiri, and that the governor himself would be at the police headquarters to be part of a parade of suspects.
“I cannot go ahead of the Commissioner to speak to you on this matter,” he said.
He would not comment further, and our correspondent learnt Wednesday evening that the planned parade had been postponed, but an unofficial police source disclosed that four suspects were arrested in connection with the illegal reformation home.
The source added that the police raid of the illegal home was conducted on Tuesday evening. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
