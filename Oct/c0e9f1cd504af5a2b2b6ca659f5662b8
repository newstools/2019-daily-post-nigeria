Former Liverpool star, Jamie Carragher has said that Manchester United could struggle to finish in the Premier League’s top six this season. Carragher warned United that they could miss out on a top-six finish this season if things continue like this for them. Ole Gunner Solskjaer’s men are 14th place in the Premier League table after nine games following two victories so far this term. The Red Devils have already lost significant ground on the top four to cast doubt on their prospects of securing Champions League football next term. Manchester United have only managed to score 10 times in the league this season to raise questions about their attacking prowess. Former Liverpool FC defender Carragher believes Manchester United could even struggle to secure a top-six finish this season. “I don’t think they’ll get top four,” Carragher told Sky Sports. “When we’re talking about Leicester getting top six and we’re not quite sure who will miss out, certainly Man United will be one of the big candidates of the top six to miss out, with Leicester going strong. “I think it was promising last week for Manchester United, I think first-half they were excellent. But you can’t play like that against the majority of teams they come up against. “Actually seeing Manchester United in the next couple of games against Norwich and Bournemouth, they’re tests for Manchester United – are they good enough to go and open those teams up?’ “They have a massive problem, they can’t score more than one goal in a game.” United finished in sixth spot in the Premier League table last term after the Norwegian head coach replaced Jose Mourinho 10 months ago.
