Brazil coach, Tite, insists Neymar showed no sign of injury before Sunday’s 1-1 friendly draw with Nigeria. Neymar was taken off after only 12 mins due to leg discomfort. Paris Saint-Germain must now hope that their star forward, is not facing another spell on the sidelines. The Ligue 1 champions face two Champions League matches against Club Brugge over the next month, as well as domestic commitments. Given the injury problems Neymar has sustained in the last two years, Tite was asked after the game if he had taken a risk by playing him. “No, not at all,” Tite replied when asked if Neymar was at risk before the game. “It would be irresponsible and incompetent of me [to play him if he was a doubt]. I would have to receive the complaints of the coach and the president of PSG if that happened.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
