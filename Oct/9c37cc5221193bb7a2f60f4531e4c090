Reno Omokri, former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has mocked President Muhammadu Buhari over the closure of Nigeria’s borders.
Omokri charged Buhari to practice what he preaches by patronising Nigerian made product, following the closure of the country’s borders.
He lamented that Buhari travels out for health reasons, and family shopping, yet closed the country’s borders.
He tweeted: “General @MBuhari goes across Nigeria’s border for: Health, His children’s school, His family’s shopping “Why does he shut the border on ordinary Nigerians? Buhari, be a leader and practice what you preach. “General @MBuhari wears IMPORTED $640 designer shoes and wristwatches. His second home is London. If he really believes in border closure, he should wear Kano made shoe and Aba made watch. Practice what you preach!” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
