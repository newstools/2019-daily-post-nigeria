Former Manchester United goalkeeper, Edwin van der Sar, has admitted he would like to return to Old Trafford in some capacity in future. Var der Sar, who is currently the CEO at Ajax, has been mentioned as a candidate for the director of football position at United, which is still unoccupied. The Dutchman joined the Red Devils in 2005 and went on to win three Premier League titles with the club, as well as the 2008 Champions League. Van der Sar retired in 2011 at the age of 40 and went on to a career in management. “Besides my family, my wife and kids and everything I have two loves in my life. “That’s Ajax, who gave me the opportunity to develop, they scouted me, they gave me the chance to shine in the world of football. “And the last club of my career (Manchester United) also gave me a lot of attention, recognition and everything, developed at a later stage. And of course, I’d be interested in a position,” Van der Sar told Planet Futbol. Though he is interested in a move back to England, the 48-year-old said he may not quite be ready to quit the Johan Cruyff Arena for Old Trafford. “I need to learn a little more here [at Ajax], develop myself further and eventually let’s see what the future brings,” Van der Sar added.
