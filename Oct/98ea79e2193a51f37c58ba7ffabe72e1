Villarreal are set to offer Samuel Chukwueze a new deal, which will also see his release clause rise up to €60million (about N24bn), Marca reports. The move is to ward off reported interest from Liverpool, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. The Super Eagles winger’s current deal which runs up until 2023, includes a release clause of €40m (about N14bn). Chukwueze broke into the Yellow Submarine first team last season and he has quickly established himself as a fans favourite at the El Madrigal. He has featured in six of their seven LaLiga games so far this season, and he looks set to play a key role this season for Villarreal, alongside Santi Cazorla and Pau Torres.
