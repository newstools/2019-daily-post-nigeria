The U.S. Embassy in Nigeria on Friday noted that Africa’s biggest nation has a lot of problems. It, however, called on Nigerians to embrace good music, which it described as a critical tool in tackling terrorism, engendering peace and promoting development. Mr. Sterling Tilley, Cultural Affairs Officer of the mission to Nigeria spoke in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja. He spoke at the 2019 Daniel Pearl’s Day is “Harmony for Humanity”, which aims at bringing the world together in peace through music which Pearl was an advocate of. According to the Cultural Affairs Officer, when an individual embraces music, such a person tends to find it difficult to harm his or her fellow countryman and others or commit an act of terror. “The message is simple – harmony and humanity – because music brings peace to people and we are hoping that through music we can also bring peace to Nigeria. “We have a lot of problems here in Nigeria, with regards to extremist groups, particularly in the North East and the best way to break the lock jam between the communities out there would be through music. “In the Nigerian environment, everyone loves music. “So if you are surrounded by that love of music, you cannot feel the need to hurt someone,” Tilley said.
