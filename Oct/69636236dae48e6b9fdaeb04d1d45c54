Tottenham Hotspur striker, Harry Kane, has reminded Virgil van Dijk that he and his Liverpool team can be beaten ahead of Sunday’s clash at Anfield. The biggest game of the Premier League weekend sees the Reds host Spurs, in a repeat of the Champions League final from June. Liverpool comfortably won that contest 2-0 in Madrid, with Kane struggling to make an impact against Van Dijk. However, Kane is in bullish mood, ahead of the game at Merseyside. “Van Dijk is a great defender but he is not invincible and Liverpool are not invincible. “We just have to concentrate on ourselves. Any team can be beaten on any day and we just have to try to make sure we do that at Anfield. “As a striker, it’s not just ­one-v-one on the pitch, there’s a lot that goes into it. Van Dijk is an amazing defender and he has had a fantastic couple of years at Liverpool. “From my point of view it’s just about playing my game and making my movements, doing my runs and trying to get on the scoresheet, trying to get assists. “At the end of the day, it’s a team game, so we all have to be on it with each other and that’s the main aim,” Kane said according to the UK Metro.
