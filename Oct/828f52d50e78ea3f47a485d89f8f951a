The University of Lagos, UNILAG, has suspended another lecturer, Dr. Samuel Oladipo, indicted in sex-for- admission scam rocking the University. Dr. Oladipo was suspended on Tuesday by the university management. He is a lecturer in the Department of Economics and was featured in the second stream of the video recording allegedly demanding for sex in exchange for admission from an undercover BBC reporter in a report titled “Sex-for-Admission.” DAILY POST reported earlier on Monday, that the school management suspended Dr Boniface Igbeneghu of the Department of European Languages and Integrated Studies, Faculty of Arts. He was caught in first in the 30-minute video recording by the BBC. The Vice-Chancellor of UNLAG, Prof Ouwatoyin Ogundipe, confirmed the suspension of Dr Oladipo by the university management to The Sun. The VC said that “Dr Oladipo was suspended on Tuesday for the same offence with Dr Igbenehu,” adding that “he will face a panel.” Also the Chairman of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) UNILAG branch, Dr Dele Ashiru, said that the sex-for-admission scandal by two of his members as unfortunate and tragic. He said the allegations against Dr Igbenehu and Dr Oladipo were sex-for-admission and not sex-for-grades and urged members to refrain from any act that could tarnish the image of the university. He said, ”The entire episode is unfortunate and tragic because lecturers are supposed to be loco parentis to the students. My appeal to our colleagues is to refrain from a negative act that can tarnish the image of the university and themselves.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
