Evicted Big Brother Naija housemate, Cindy, has broken silence on the fight between Mercy and Tacha in BBNaija house. DAILY POST recalls that Tacha was on Friday disqualified from the BBNaija ‘Pepper Dem’ edition after she broke the rules of Big Brother. Biggie on Friday night, who quoted an article from Big Brother’s rules, said ”You are guilty of physical assault and violence.” This was following a fight that ensued between her and Mercy which caused an uproar on social media. He, therefore, disqualified Tacha from the reality show and issued two strikes to Mercy. Cindy, upon her eviction from the house, admitted that she instigated the fight between Mercy and Tacha before she left the house. Cindy told BBNaija official host, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu that she did not expect the fight to escalate because Tacha and Mercy avoided each other a lot during the show. According to her, she just told Tacha that that Mercy said she was stupid. “Tacha was avoiding me, I also noticed she avoided Mercy. “I told Tacha that Mercy called her stupid but I didn’t know what I said was going to cause that kind of fight “Naturally, they would just avoided each other and end it but that day, something went wrong,” Cindy added.
