Arsenal legend, Martin Keown, has said Ainsley Maitland-Niles is wasting his talent at the club, after a poor display in the Europa League. The 22-year-old started Arsenal’s clash with Vitoria Guimaraes at the Emirates on Thursday night, but was substituted at half-time. Maitland-Niles was culpable for the Portuguese side’s second goal, giving the ball away in the middle of the pitch in the build-up. Keown, speaking to BT Sport, described the player as “lazy” and sloppy”. He said: “[Hector] Bellerin is playing in his preferred position [right-back] tonight, [Calum] Chambers has taken his berth in the Premier League. “He looked like he was feeling sorry for himself tonight and there’s no time for that from as professional footballer. “Maitland-Niles is all at sea [for the second goal], it’s a laziness and a sloppiness. “The player has got great ability but he’s wasting his talent at the moment.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
