FIFA will pay Francis Uzoho’s wages, during his spell on the sidelines, according to AllNigeriaSoccer. Uzoho could be out of action for more than six months, after suffering a fracture of the meniscus and the anterior cruciate ligament on his left knee, during Nigeria’s 1-1 draw with Brazil on Sunday. The 20-year-old is now set to undergo surgery in Spain. FIFA recognizes the Brazil vs Nigeria friendly, as it was played on a date on their international match calendar and both teams did not field more than six substitutes each. Under the FIFA’s Club Protection Programme, clubs whose players suffer injuries whilst on international duty, are compensated and the maximum daily compensation has been set at €20,548. The compensation payable is based solely on the fixed salary the club pays directly to the player, as his employer and the temporary total disablement (TTD) suffered by the player, has to prevent him from representing his club for more than 28 days before a claim can be processed.
