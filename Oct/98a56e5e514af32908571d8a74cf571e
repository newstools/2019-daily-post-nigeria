Premier League bosses will meet to discuss a review of the current VAR system, the UK Times reports. This follows another weekend of high-profile incidents, with Everton and Arsenal in particular on the receiving end of harsh decisions. VAR has now been used in 100 Premier League matches this season, with as many as 26 decisions overturned, including Brighton’s controversial penalty award and Arsenal having a late winner ruled out against Crystal Palace. However, there has not been a single occasion, where the referee has consulted the pitchside monitor. Premier League officials have been encouraged to minimise delays, by leaving decision-making to the VAR. But a string of high-profile decisions, have led to calls for referees to take a look at the monitors. The policy will be reviewed at the next Premier League meeting in three weeks’ time.
