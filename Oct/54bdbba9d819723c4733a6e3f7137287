The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB, has advised candidates not to pay money to any of its staff for any services. Rather, JAMB has asked the candidates to direct all payments for its services to the Treasury Single Account, TSA. This is coming on the heels of allegation that some workers of JAMB in its Lagos office were extorting N2000 from students who wanted to do any documentation with them. Reacting, JAMB said it frowns at any form of financial dealings between candidates and its workers. In a terse statement on its Twitter handle on Thursday, the Board said: “All payments on JAMB services are made directly to the board’s TSA. Please be informed that the board frowns on any form of financial dealings between candidates and workers. “Candidates involved in any financial transaction with a staff of the board should notify the board immediately and also provide any useful information about such staff for necessary action.” Recall that the board had earlier advised candidates who wish to write the 2020 UTME to visit the nearest National Identity Management Commission’s office to have their data captured. It said candidates must register for the National Identification Number as a prerequisite to writing the 2020 examination. “All candidates wishing to take the 2020 UTME must have the National Identification Number. Prospective candidates are urged to visit the nearest NIMC office for their capturing. The board would only register candidates with NIN,” it said.
