Former two division world boxing champion, Timothy Bradley, has urged Anthony Joshua to go for the knockout when he faces Andy Ruiz in a rematch on December 7th in Saudi Arabia. In the first bout, back on June 1, Joshua was dropped four times before the contest was waved off in the seventh round in New York City. Ruiz, who came in as a late replacement and a huge underdog, walked away with the IBF, IBO, WBA, WBO world titles. Joshua quickly exercised the contractual clause for an immediate rematch, and he vowed to correct his mistakes. However, Bradley while speaking in an interview with FightHype, said Joshua should forget about boxing it out to a decision, and go for the knock-out win. “He (Joshua) is got to knock him (Ruiz) out. It was a mental thing and it was a fact that he got caught right on the button. It was a fact that he didn’t train like he normally trains for big fights. “He possibly took Ruiz lightly in looking at his physique like – ‘oh, he’s nothing.'” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
