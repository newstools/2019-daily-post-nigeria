Bede Eke, a member representing Mbaise/Ngor-Okpalla Federal Constituency of Imo State, has said that the time is right for Igbo to occupy the leadership position of the country. He said that the presidency should be conceded to the South East in 2023 in the spirit of justice, enquiry and fair play. Eke who addressed newsmen in Abuja over the weekend pointed out that the move will put an end to the clamouring for the Republic of Biafra under whatever guise by the people of the region. He said, “On the continued agitations for South-East presidency in 2023, yes, we want it. “I am of the opinion that we should be given a chance. Talk about the late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Aguyi Ironsi; we have not been given a chance since the independence. “We talk about three geopolitical zones in the country; Hausa, Yoruba have had their chances but what about the Igbo? Even if only the marginalisation we are crying, why don’t you give it to us? “If we have the slot of being the president of Nigeria, that will go a long way. If you can give us the presidency of Nigeria, it will address this problem of people clamouring for Biafra. “We are all equal before God, no region or zone is superior to one another, we should be given a sense of belonging in the scheme of things, we have qualified materials to occupy that position.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
