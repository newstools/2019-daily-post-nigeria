Parents of six students detained in prison for seven months by the management of Madonna University, Okija Anambra State, have rejected the order of the founder of the university, Rev Fr Emmanuel Edeh to apologise to the institution. Six students of the university who were detained for allegedly criticising the university on social media have been released on bail on the order of the court. But one of the parents of the students, Chief Christopher Onyejekwe said in one of their meetings with the university’s management, it accepted that the matter be settled out of court, but the founder of the institution, Rev Fr Emmanuel Eden had insisted on the parents apologizing to the institution. He added that the parents have vowed not to apologise to the institution, saying that it cannot apologise to the university for unjustly imprisoning their children. “We realized that giving peace a chance will be in the best interest of the image of the church, the image of Madonna and decided to settle the matter on a round table. “We were optimistic that the voice of reason would prevail, but when the resolution of our meeting was presented to the founder of the university, Rev Father Edeh, he asked us to tender individual apologies to the university. “Why should we tender apologies to him, for detaining our children in prison for seven months and ruining their career? We won’t do that. We’ve decided to carry on with the matter in court, no going back,” Onyejekwe stated. When contacted on the telephone for a reaction, the deputy registrar of the university, Charles Njoku said,” I can’t react. They have just sacked me from the university without any reason giving to me. I’m in my house.” Asked whether his sacking had anything to do with the detained students’ matter, Njoku said, I don’t know. They didn’t give me any reason for my sack.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
