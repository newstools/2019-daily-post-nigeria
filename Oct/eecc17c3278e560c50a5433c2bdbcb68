Former Arsenal defender, Martin Keown, has told playmaker, Mesut Ozil that only hard work will save his career at the club. Ozil has fallen out of favour at Emirates since manager, Unai Emery took over from Arsene Wenger. The 30-year-old only made just 24 Premier League appearances for the Gunners last season. Ozil, who joined Arsenal from Real Madrid in the summer of 2013, has not been regular for Arsenal so far this campaign. He also missed Arsenal’s 1-0 victory over Bournemouth in the Premier League last weekend.  But Keown has now said that the ex-Germany international must show the other side of his game in order to make Emery’s first team. “I think it’s disappointing that Ozil with that amount of talent can’t find his way into an Arsenal team,” Keown was quoted by Metro UK a saying. “And again, that’s about balance. That’s about a player wanting to graft and show the other side of his game. Until he does that, he won’t be in this new Arsenal team.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
