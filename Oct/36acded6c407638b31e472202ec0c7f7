Liverpool midfielder, Fabinho, has insisted that Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah have a good relationship, despite the pair appearing to have an on-field argument during the Reds’ 3-0 win over Burnley in August. The duo clashed when Mane was angry with Salah, for not passing to him while he was in a good position, with the Egyptian instead opting to go for goal himself. Cameras picked up Mane furiously gesticulating with teammates when he was substituted shortly after the incident, leading some to speculate that the two did not get on. But Fabinho has said there was nothing personal and that it is something that can happen in the heat of the moment. “The day after (the game) they joke in the dressing room, they speak normally and they are very good friends. “In the moment of the game all players are a little bit hot; it’s not the first time and it won’t be the last,” Fabinho told Straits Times.
