Nigeria’s senior women’s team will miss the Olympic Games for the third time in a row, after losing on away goals to Cote d’Ivoire in Lagos on Monday. Both teams played out a 0-0 draw in the first leg in Abidjan. However, a 1-1 draw in Lagos, saw Christopher Danjuma’s side bow out of the qualifiers at the same stage as four years ago. The third round result means the reigning African queens will miss the Olympic Games for the third successive time, and also for the second on the bounce under coach Danjuma. Cote d’Ivoire, who advance at the expense of Nigeria, will take on either Cameroon or the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the fourth round of the qualifying series next month.
