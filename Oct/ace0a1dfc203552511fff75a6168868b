Abba Moro, Senator representing Benue South Senatorial District has congratulated the Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom on his victory at the election tribunal. DAILY POST had reported that the election tribunal on Monday in Makurdi, Benue State, upheld Ortom’s election.  Emmanuel Jime of the All Progressives Congress had approached the court, seeking the nullification of Ortom’s election, citing irregularities and over voting during the last election. However, the tribunal threw out Jime’s case for failing to prove it beyond reasonable doubt. Reading the judgment on Monday evening, Chairman of the Tribunal, Justice Henry Olusiyi, said Jime’s request for nullification of Ortom’s election lacked merit and “hereby dismissed outrightly.” Reacting, Senator Moro expressed happiness at the ruling. A statement by Moro’s Special Assistant on New Media, Emmanuel Eche-Ofun John said the lawmaker
“is happy that the Governor won at both the polls and the tribunal, which further confirmed that the people of Benue State willingly gave him their mandate in the last election. “He prays for wisdom for the Governor to deliver on his campaign promises, to leave Benue better than he met it. “He also urged the Governor to continue with his developmental strides to deliver more dividends of democracy to the people of Benue State.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
