Arsenal Manager, Unai Emery, risks losing his job if he fails to deliver a return to the Champions League, after spending £152million on new players in the summer. The Gunners are once again competing in Europe’s second-tier competition, after finishing fifth last season. However, they currently sit in third place, going into the international break. Head of Football, Raul Sanllehi, has admitted anything less is not good enough. Speaking at a fans’ forum on Thursday night, he admitted: “We said to Unai that we just missed out on qualifying for the Champions League last year, but this year with a stronger squad, we expect you to do that.” It is understood Emery’s deal runs out in 2020, with an option for one more year.
