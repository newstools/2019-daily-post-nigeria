The President of Trade Union Congress, Quadri Olaleye, on Friday, said that the Federal Government has asked for an extension of ultimatum from organised labour, in order to stop the looming strike over minimum wage. The Federal Government and the Joint National Public Service Negotiating Council, which is representing labour unions in the negotiation for the total implementation of the new minimum wage, will meet on Tuesday after the first phase of negotiation collapsed, due to percentage differences. However, labour had already issued an October 16, 2019 ultimatum for government to accept its demands on the consequential adjustment in workers’ salary. Olaleye said that apart from fixing a date for a meeting on Tuesday, FG had made several attempts to ensure that the strike would not hold. He said, “Those on the government negotiating team are too slow with the level of their consultation. For example, for an ultimatum that will expire on October 16, 2019, instead of concentrating on how to resolve the issues, they are asking for extension of the ultimatum which is not going to be possible. “The decision is that of the organ comprising the CWC, NAC and NEC of labour unions. It will be very difficult to call them back and review the position with the view to extending it. It will be impossible at this short time.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
