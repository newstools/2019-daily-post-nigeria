Former Manchester United defender, Patrice Evra, has criticised Arsenal’s “weak mentality” and labelled them “babies”, following their 1-0 defeat at Sheffield United. The Gunners missed the chance to go third in the table, after Lys Mousset’s first-half strike gave Sheffield United the three points at Bramall Lane on Monday. Evra, speaking on Monday Night Football, revealed he used to refer to Arsenal as “babies” during his United career and believes nothing has changed at the club since Arsene Wenger’s departure. “Sheffield United deserved the win, but I’m not surprised about Arsenal. “I used to call them ‘my babies’ 10 years ago, and they are still, when I look at them and think they are ‘my babies’… that’s the truth – I’m not being disrespectful when I say that. “They look pretty, but they don’t look like a winning team. They like playing good football, but I was so happy to play against them, because I knew I was going to win. “Even when Robin van Persie came, and on the first day I shook his hand, and I said, ‘welcome to a man’s club’. At the beginning, he was upset, but after one month he said, ‘you were completely right, Patrice’. “I just don’t see any leadership. I don’t see any character or any personality. They look weak mentally. “They have big players in David Luiz, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette, but there has been something missing for a few years now. “Matteo Guendouzi was playing in midfield, but before he was playing in the French second league and he was not even playing regularly – and he’s the best player in this team. “I respect Aubameyang and Lacazette, but if those two guys don’t score, they’re in trouble, and nothing changes. I’m like, ‘where is Arsene?’ It is the same,” Evra said. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
