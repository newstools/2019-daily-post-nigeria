Brazil coach, Tite, has praised his players for playing better in the second half of Sunday’s international friendly against Nigeria. Joe Aribo opened scoring in the 35th minute, before Casemiro made it 1-1 in the second half. The Brazilians went closest to scoring again, but had to settle for a draw in Singapore. “The result was insufficient. In terms of results, the Brazilian team always wants to win and seeks to win. “But especially in the second half, we had a great performance. We had ball possession and creativity. “It’s no use having possession of the ball without creating, but we did. It was not effective to score,” Tite told a news conference after the game.
