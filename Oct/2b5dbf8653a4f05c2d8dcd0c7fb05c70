Arsenal Head of Football, Raul Sanllehi, has backed manager, Unai Emery, over his decision to axe Mesut Ozil from the Gunners’ recent squads. Ozil, who is the highest earner at the club, has only played once in the Premier League this season. The German also featured in the Carabao Cup demolition of Nottingham Forest. Ozil was on the bench against Aston Villa towards the end of September but was omitted from the matchday squads entirely for fixtures against Manchester United and Bournemouth. There have been reports that Ozil has failed to impress Emery in training, while the manager himself has made it clear that other players “deserve it more” to be in the squad. Sanllehi was at a fan’s forum event on Thursday evening and was asked about the current situation surrounding Ozil. Speaking to supporters, he said: “Unai’s policy has always been to play the ones that work hard in training.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
