Barcelona are ready to offer Lionel Messi a “lifelong contract”, Cadena Ser reports. Messi is contracted to Barca until June 2021, which means he would be going into the last year of his deal next summer, if he fails to agree a new contract. There were concerns that the Argentine could indeed leave the club with whom he has spent his whole career with. However, Barca plan to renew his contract for the remainder of his career and beyond. It is claimed that the Spanish giants are on the brink of offering Messi a “lifelong” contract, that goes beyond football and would tie the ‘Messi’ brand to the club for at least another 10 years. The Barca forward last signed an agreement in November 2017, which is reportedly worth €70million and includes exclusive image rights and a €100million signing on bonus.
