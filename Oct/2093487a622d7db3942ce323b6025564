Head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, has said he will respect Fikayo Tomori and Tammy Abraham’s wishes, of not opting to represent Nigeria at the moment. The Chelsea duo, who are also eligible to represent England, are not looking to commit to the West African nation at the present time. “They are both interesting players, but we have made our immediate plans without Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori. “They are not interested in discussing their international options at the moment and we need to respect that,” Rohr told BBC Sport. Rohr’s men take on Brazil in an international friendly match on October 13 in Singapore.
