Tanko Yakasai, a Second Republic politician and Northern elder, on Tuesday reacted to President Muhammadu Buhari’s Independence Day nationwide broadcast. Buhari had in a 7am nationwide broadcast to mark Nigeria at 59, addressed Nigerians on issues and efforts being made by his administration. Yakasai said Nigerians have seen no changed promised them by the Buhari administration despite giving it everything needed to assume power. Featuring Channels Television, Yakasai insisted that nothing has changed with the way the country was currently being governed by the All Progressives Congress, APC. Yakasai, an ex-political adviser to former President, late Shehu Shagari, said the Buhari-led administration has performed low since taking over in 2015. According to Yakasai, Nigerians made the mistake of not asking the APC-led administration what change it would bring. He said: “Almost five years after the APC rule, nothing has changed. “But our mistake is that when we decided to support APC on their change slogan, we did not ask them ‘what will it cost you the change that you are talking about?’. “We kept quiet, we supported them, we gave them almost everything they wanted; now after taking over power, we didn’t see any change.” He also called for the restructuring of Nigeria, stressing that it would result in a better nation to be bequeathed to future generations. The former presidential adviser stated that Nigeria has not done enough to meet the expectation of its founding fathers in the area of development.
