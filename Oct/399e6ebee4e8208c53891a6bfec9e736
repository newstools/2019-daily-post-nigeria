Gov. Nasir El-Rufa’i of Kaduna State has said that his child will remain in public school in spite of the ‘invasion’ of the state by kidnappers and Boko Haram elements. El-Rufa’i gave the assurance in a chat with newsmen on Friday in Abuja. On Wednesday, Kaduna witnessed the abduction of six students and two teachers at the Engrave’s College in Kakau Daji area. The governor said his child should not be safer or more protected than any other child in the state. “My child should not be safer or more protected than any other child in Kaduna State”, NAN quoted him as saying. “I took an oath of office to protect everyone and my child is just only one of the two million children we have in Kaduna state primary schools and I have no intention of reviewing that. “For me taking my child to a government school was not only a commitment I made but a clear expression that I have enough confidence in the quality of our public schools for my child to attend”, the governor stressed.
