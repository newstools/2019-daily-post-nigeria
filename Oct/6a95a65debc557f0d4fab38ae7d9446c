The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, has said those talking about grabbing power in 2023 or printing posters, are playing god. Oshiomhole stated this in Abuja on Thursday, during a reconciliation meeting with aggrieved aspirants and stakeholders from Bayelsa State, ahead of the November 16 governorship election. He accused the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of pasting posters of him and other party stalwarts, in order to cause disaffection in the ruling party. With reference to the 2023 posters of some APC stalwarts sighted in Abuja recently, Oshiomhole said, “Only those who play god can begin to position themselves now for 2023. “We believe that these are the handiwork of the PDP who thinks that they can create suspicion within the rank of the APC by nominating for our party who they think or purporting or attempting to print for some elements in our party whether to create complete diversion. “So, I stand here as the National Chairman of the APC not only to deny those posters as they affect me but to deny those posters as they affect any leader of our party because it is not yet time. Even people who may have ambition are aware that this is not the time. “At this point in time, all hands must be on deck to support President Muhammadu Buhari and all our state governors in their respective states to work together unanimously to deliver deliverables for the good of our people in the states and at the federal level. “This is not the time to discuss politics, politics cannot be an all round season, the season for politics is over. There is time for politicking and there is time for governance.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
