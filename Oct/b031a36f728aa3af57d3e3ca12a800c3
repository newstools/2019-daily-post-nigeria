Former Chelsea and Leicester City manager, Claudio Ranieri, has been appointed the Coach of Italian side, Sampdoria on a contract that runs until June 2021. The 67-year-old takes charge of a team that is rooted at the bottom of Serie A table after seven matches this season. That run of form this week resulted in the dismissal of Eusebio Di Francesco, who Ranieri also replaced at Roma. A statement on Sampdoria’s official website said: “President Massimo Ferrero and Sampdoria welcome Claudio Ranieri, who has joined the club as head coach responsible for the first team until June 30, 2021. “The president wishes the coach, his staff and the team a good job based on commitment and passion.” Meanwhile, DAILY POST reports that Ranieri’s first game in charge of Sampdoria will be on October 20 against Roma, the previous club he coached.
