Nigeria played out a 1-1 draw with Brazil in an international friendly match on Sunday. The Super Eagles took the lead in the 35th minute, after Joe Aribo danced past several Selecao defenders to slide the ball under Ederson. However, with barely five minutes gone after the break, the Brazilians drew level. Real Madrid midfielder, Casemiro, pounced on a defensive mixup to score for the South Americans. Although Tite’s men grew stronger in the second half, they failed to add more goals and had to settle for another draw in the space of four days. They had been held to a 1-1 draw by Senegal on Thursday. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
