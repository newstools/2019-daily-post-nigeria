The University of Ilorin Chapter of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has asked her members to disregard the order to enrol on Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS).
The UNILORIN-ASUU, which has fully returned to the Union with new leadership, stated that any move by the federal government to attempt a stoppage of salaries will be resisted with the activation of a total showdown. DAILY POST gathered that there had been crises over the enrolment of lecturers in tertiary institutions across the country and the federal government of Nigeria. But, UNILORIN-ASUU, which is under Ibadan Zone of the Union also asked the Accountant General of the Federation to stop wasting tax payer’s money in placing propaganda and misinformation in the public In a congress resolution signed by its Chairperson, Professor Moyo Ajao, ASUU advised federal government to address the challenges raised by the Union on the ‘mere spreadsheet’ presented to it by its IPPIS Contractor. The congress resolved that the union will not be cajoled or forced into the scheme. Ajao in the resolution made available to DAILY POST on Wednesday, said, “Members noted that ASUU as a body is not against integrity and anti-corruption crusade of the FG but will not be coerced by the campaign of calumny being presently championed by the office of accountant General of the Federation, wasting tax payers money to whip the public up into a sentiment state and paint ASUU bad. “ASUU as a responsible Union is committed to university autonomy vis-a-vis Council roles in our Universities, legal and technical implications of enrolling its members on IPPIS and that FG should rather address challenges raised on the mere spread sheet presented by its contractor as IPPIS template”.
