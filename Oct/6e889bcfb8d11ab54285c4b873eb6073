Former Arsenal midfielder, Charlie Nicholas, has backed Manchester United to hold Premier League leaders Liverpool to a draw this weekend. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men have won just two of their opening eight league fixtures this season and could drop into the relegation zone, if they lose on Sunday. The Reds travel to Old Trafford boasting an unbeaten record and an eight-point gap at the top of the table. Nicholas feels United will frustrate Liverpool and is tipping England striker, Marcus Rashford, to earn his side a point. He told Sky Sports: “I think because of the desire from Man Utd, an average team at the moment, and given the chance to turn it on and knock Liverpool’s chances of winning the league, they may well do that. “Why does it take this for them to become motivated? If they draw do they take credit from that? “As an Arsenal fan, this always used to be the game for them and was the one I was always intrigued by. “It was always at Old Trafford where the great games were. Anfield was more atmospheric and vibrant, but this was always the test for Liverpool, as they have never won the Premier League. “They have battered them on a few occasions and Man Utd still won the title, but this is do or die for United and a day of credibility for them to try and get a point, which I think they will do.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
