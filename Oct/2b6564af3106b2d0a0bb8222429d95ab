Jose Mourinho has praised Lille manager, Christophe Galtier, hailing his ability to develop young players like Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen. Mourinho was in the director’s box as Osimhen continued his lethal form for Lille, scoring in a fifth straight home match as Lille were held 2-2 by Nimes yesterday. The 20-year-old now has eight goals in 11 appearances for the Ligue 1 side. Mourinho has been a regular at Lillegames, after being sacked by Manchester United in December and has not hidden his admiration for Galtier. He told L’Equipe TV: “I think he (Galtier) is the coach of the season. He’s qualified his side for the Champions League and they were runners-up in the French League. “Then there is the high quality of football and his development of young players. He is the man of the season.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
