England manager, Gareth Southgate, on Monday said he was proud of his players and staff following their 6-0 victory over Bulgaria in a Euro 2020 qualifier encounter. Southgate also said he notified the referee officials after the Three Lions were subjected to racist abuse during their victory over the host. Goals from Marcus Rashford (1), Ross Barkley (2), Raheem Sterling (2) and Harry Kane (1) gave England all three points against Bulgaria. “I have to say that the officials were on to everything very quickly. We reported everything immediately when we heard things,” Southgate told ITV. “We had constant communication with the fourth official and the referee. I was in contact with the players all the way through the first half in particular and then again at half-time. “We know it’s an unacceptable situation. We’ve managed to make two statements really, by winning the game but also by raising the awareness of everyone to the situation. “The game was stopped twice and I know for some people that won’t be enough but I think as a group we were on board with that process.” “I’m incredibly proud of all my players and staff,” Southgate added. “We prepared for this game on the field and off the field. The whole group have been united in where they stood on what might happen, where we were during the game, at half-time and we’ve spoken again at the end.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
