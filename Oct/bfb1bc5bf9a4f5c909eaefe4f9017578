A Federal High Court sitting in Osun Stateon Wednesday ordered two friends, Akanni Kenny and Abidoye Obafemi to be remanded in a correctional facility for allegedly being in possession of Cannabis Sativa, also known as Indian hemp. The presiding judge, Justice Peter Lifu, said the duo should be remanded due to the magnitude of the alleged offense, as they both pleaded not guilty to the offence leveled against them. Counsel to the Nigeria Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, Mr O.F Azugo, had earlier informed the court that the defendants committed the offence on Aug. 24 ,at Ipetu-Ijesa , a town in Osun. He claimed that operatives of the agency rounded the two defendants up while on transit with the illicit substance. According to him, the offence contravened the provisions of sections 19 and 20 (1)(a) of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency Act Cap 30, laws of the Federation ,2004. The presiding judge, thereafter, overruled the bail application filed by defence counsel, Mr O.N. Benson, as he adjourned the matter till Oct. 30.
