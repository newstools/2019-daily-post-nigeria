The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State has adopted a no-zoning policy in picking the party’s governorship candidate for next year’s election in the state. The party has also resolved that the position of the state chairman would not be zoned as well. A former governor of the state, Mr. Lucky Igbinedion disclosed the no-zoning arrangement to journalists on Thursday in Abuja after the Edo State chapter of the PDP met with the national leadership of the party. Igbinedion explained: “The idea behind a no-zoning system for the emergence of the governorship candidate and chairman of the PDP in the state is to throw up the best candidates for the two positions.” He also said that the party adopted the zero-zoning option for both the governorship candidate and the state chairman as one of the measures to present a united party ahead of the 2020 governorship election in the state. The ex-Governor however, did not give details of the new arrangement. Corroborating Igbinedion, the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan said, “they (Edo PDP) came to raise issues about the tenureship of their executive and the party said they would look into the details to know whether the tenure has elapsed or to know when the tenure will elapse. “They were not complaining that the tenure had ended. They just wanted to know when the tenure will end and how soon they will have a congress because they want to go to the next election as a united party. “The party has promised to look into the records. They want the party united before the 2020 election so that they can win,” the spokesman of PDP said.
