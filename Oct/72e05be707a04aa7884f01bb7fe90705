Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has said “the club and I” are responsible for the recent slump in form. The Gunners have won just two of their last eight league games. They now face a tricky trip to Anfield, to face Liverpool in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night. Emery admits results have not been good enough, but insists he has the faith of the owners. “We are responsible, the club and I. “We know our responsibility is to help everybody, and also when we are making some mistakes to recognise it. “Sunday, for example, after the match, Josh Kroenke was also in the dressing room speaking with me. We were speaking for 10 minutes about the situation but all the time helping each other. “He’s supporting me, he’s supporting the players, we were talking about the circumstance with Granit Xhaka, saying that he was wrong and we need to manage that with him,” Emery told reporters ahead of the game.
