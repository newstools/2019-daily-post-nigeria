The Kano State Police Command has arrested three military personnel for engaging in a physical combat with officials of Kano Road Traffic Agency (KAROTA). Spokesperson of the command, DSP Abdullahi Haruna, confirmed the incident to DAILY POST on Tuesday. He said the incident happened on Monday in Kano Municipal at about 1:00pm when KAROTA officials on duty along Sharada market junction attempted to call the military personnel to order for violating traffic regulations. “The problem started when the military personnel allegedly followed one way and KAROTA officials blocked them for violating the traffic rules. “The situation worsened when military personnel and KAROTA officers began to exchange abusive words, which lead them in to physical combat, he said. Haruna said the case is still under investigation. An eyewitness told DAILY POST that the situation went out of control when one of the military officers beat and injured one KAROTA official on the head. Kano State Government had established the Agency in 2012 to control traffic, curb gridlocks, and enforce law and order among road users.
