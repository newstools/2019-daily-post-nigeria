Lille striker, Victor Osimhen, has been named the French Ligue 1 Player of the Month for September 2019. The Super Eagles star, who joined Lille this summer from Sporting Charleroi, won 45% of the vote to finish ahead of Monaco’s Islam Slimani (37%) and Nantes’ Nicolas Pallois (18%). Osimhen was involved in four goals (2 goals, 2 assists) for his new side last month. He found the net against SCO Angers and Strasbourg and provided assists in matches against Rennes and Strasbourg. With 7 goals in 9 appearances in the Ligue 1, Osimhen is the fourth highest goalscorer in the top five European Leagues, behind Bayern Munich’s Lewandowski (11 goals), Manchester City’s Aguero and Chelsea’s Abraham (both with 8 goals).
