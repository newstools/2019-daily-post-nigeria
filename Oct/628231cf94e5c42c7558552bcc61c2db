Jose Mourinho turned down Lyon’s approach to become their new manager, because he had already found another club, according to the Ligue 1 side’s president Jean-Michel Aulas. The Portuguese has been without a job, since he was sacked at Manchester United. Instead, Mourinho has turned to punditry, while rejecting several offers. Lyon sacked Sylvinho on Monday, after just one win in his last nine matchesand Aulas had identified Mourinho as his replacement. However, speaking to reporters via a telephone news conference, the 70-year-old revealed that the ex-Chelsea and Inter coach, turned them down on account of having another job lined up. “We had some fairly flattering exchanges over text. “It was nice for everyone. He did not accept our proposal to meet because he has already chosen another club,” Aulas said.
