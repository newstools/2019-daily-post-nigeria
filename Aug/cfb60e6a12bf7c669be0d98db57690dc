The Oyo State Road Traffic Management Authority (OYRTMA) on Wednesday revealed that no fewer than 395 vehicles and 60 motorcycles have been impounded since January this year. The Director of Administrative and Supply, OYRTMA, Mr Tunde Aiki made this known in an interview with journalists after one of the agency’s operations in Ibadan, the state capital. The operation which took place around Agodi-Gate area, Ibadan saw the agency’s officials arresting traffic law offenders even while it rained. Aiki while speaking, said that OYRTMA had the responsibility of maintaining the state’s road traffic laws, as well as maintaining orderliness and control in the road traffic system of the state. Aiki noted that the existence of the agency was not to generate revenue for the government through collection of fines from traffic law offenders as most people believed, but to increase the compliance level of road users to traffic laws. He said, “We have discovered that more commercial road users violates basic traffic laws, especially those who do not make use of the designated bus stops as their pick up or drop off points for passengers. Offences committed by private motorists are more grievous, which include leaving one’s lane to face an oncoming vehicle and parking inappropriately on the road. “We want to appeal to pedestrians and motorists to always take into consideration the safety of other road users as well as acquaint themselves with the traffic laws of the state.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
