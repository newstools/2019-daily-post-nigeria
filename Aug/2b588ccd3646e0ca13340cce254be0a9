Manchester United goalkeeper, David de Gea, has been blamed for club’s 1-1 draw with Southampton on Saturday. Andy Gray, a former Scotland international, said the Spanish goalkeeper should have done better in the build-up to Southampton’s equalising goal at St Mary’s. United dropped points for the third successive Premier League game despite taking the lead against the Saints through a fine early strike from Daniel James. Southampton, however, came back into the match in the second half with defender, Jannik Vestergaard levelling with his first goal for the club when he headed home a cross from Kevin Danso. Vestergaard’s goal came about after De Gea had acrobatically pushed away an initial header from Danny Ings, with the ball then falling to Danso to cross. Gray a former Everton forward said that Spaniard should have dealt with the initial header in a more comfortable fashion. “It’s right at him,” Gray told beIN Sports. “If it’s to the side of him okay I get that but it was pretty much straight at him. “It wasn’t like it was a fierce shot, just a little glancing header from a corner. “There wasn’t a great deal of pace on the ball. David de Gea in my opinion is miles good enough to have dealt with that with a catch.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
