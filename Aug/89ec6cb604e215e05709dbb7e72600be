Sir Diamond Ovueraye, Supreme Knight of the Order of the Knights of St. Mulumba (KSM), Nigeria, has urged the Buhari government to curb activities of murderous herdsmen by establishing regional policing to combat security challenges facing the country. Ovueraye said this on Tuesday at the Fourth Degree Investiture Ceremony of the Order of the Knights of St. Mulumba at St Agnes Catholic Church, Maryland, Lagos, NAN reports. He said that when the government establishes regional policing, it would help tackle security challenges facing Nigeria. “Herdsmen are on rampage even in the western region, killing and kidnapping people, this must stop, government at all levels need to tackle it seriously, and make sure that there is security in the country. “What we need to consider is the possibility of having regional security forces; what we can call regional policing,” Ovueraye said. The supreme knight, who explained what the fourth degree investiture means, said that the fourth degree was different from the other degrees in the KSM.
