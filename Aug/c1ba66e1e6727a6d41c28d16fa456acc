The Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, has said he and the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, have met to resolve the issues between them. Obaseki stated this at St Paul Catholic Church, Benin, during a mass organised to mark the 80th birthday of former APC national chairman, John Odigie-Oyegun, on Monday. He said “things will soon return to normalcy in the state.” “I thank you very much for the remarkable homily. I listened very attentively and I have taken every word in your remark to heart and very seriously. I want to assure you that we are in pursuit of peace and we will have peace in Edo state. “We have met – me and my predecessor in office – and fortunately, we do not have any fundamental issues. And because we do not have any fundamental issues, I believe that whatever third parties are trying to propagate I am sure we can talk over it. I assure you that very soon things will return to normalcy in Edo state.” The clash between Obaseki and Oshiomhole, led to the factionalisation of the state assembly. Nine lawmakers loyal to Obaseki were secretly inaugurated on June 17, leaving their colleagues in Oshiomhole’s camp stranded. The National Assembly had asked the Governor to issue a fresh proclamation for the State Assembly, but he refused.
