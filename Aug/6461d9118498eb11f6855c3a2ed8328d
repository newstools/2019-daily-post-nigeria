Shkodran Mustafi’s father and agent, Kuhtim, has admitted he is working on a move away from Arsenal, the UK Mirror reports. The German defender has not been involved in the Gunners’ first two matches of the season and has been told to find a new club by manager Unai Emery. Mustafi has until September 2 to complete a move to a foreign club, with Emery also advising Mohamed Elneny to move on. The former Valencia defender has another two years remaining on his current contract, but his father Kujtim suggests a move is on the cards. “Shkodran had a great time with Arsenal. We still have a contract for two years and can imagine to stay in London. “However the best for both sides is probably to work on a transfer. But for that it also needs market-driven transfer-fees,” he said in a statement.
