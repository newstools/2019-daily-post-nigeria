Two suspected thieves who specialized in vandalizing power installations in Akoko axis of the Ondo North Senatorial district of Ondo State have been caught by residents of Irun-Akoko. The suspects identified as Togo and Ibrahim who have been handed over to the police at Irun divisional police headquarters were apprehended while vandalizing transformer cables in Ejidu quarters area of the community in Akoko North West Local Government. According to sources, the suspects were caught while committing the act in the wee hours of Wednesday by residents following the reconnection of the community back to the national grid earlier. The people of Irun and its environs have been thrown into total darkness for over four years before the intervention of some concerned indigenes and the government. Few weeks after they were reconnected, some vandals had vandalized one of the transformers in the town, which had caused some parts of the town to be in total darkness since then. This forced residents of the town to contribute money to replace the cables that were carted away by the hoodlums. Femi Joseph, the spokesperson of the Ondo State Police Command confirmed the arrest of the two suspects, adding that they will be charged to court upon the completion of its investigation.
