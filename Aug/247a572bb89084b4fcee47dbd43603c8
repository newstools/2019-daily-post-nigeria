Founder of High Tower Prayer Ministry Inc located at Baruwa-Ipaja, Lagos state, Prophet Rufus Olawale Ikotun, has said that there are moves to islamize Nigeria. Prophet Ikotun, who spoke to newsmen in Lagos, said though the signs are there, but God will not allow it to happen. He said, “It can never work in Jesus name! They have been trying it but it can’t work.” He cited the closure of a bank helping Churches and the establishment of the Islamic Bank as one of the clear indications that Islamization was going on in Nigeria. He added, “What happened to a bank that was helping churches? They have closed it down but it won’t happen in the case of Islam.” “We have an Islamic bank in Nigeria today. The only bank supporting Christians is the one by The Redeemed Christian Church Of God but you would pass through a lot before you can get anything there,” he noted.
