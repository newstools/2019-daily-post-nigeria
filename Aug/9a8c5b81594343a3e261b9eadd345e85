Ghanian actress, Juliet Ibrahim has finally reacted to her ex-boyfriend, Iceberg Slim’s apology, which went viral days ago on social media. DAILYPOST had reported that Iceberg Slim took to his Instagram page to apologize to Juliet for lying, cheating and hurting her feelings which eventually led to their breakup. But during an interview with Accra FM, the actress admitted she forgave the Nigerian singer a longtime ago, but the apology came quite late. She, however, made it clear that she is not getting back with him, but hopes the apology helps in the healing process he talked about. “I feel like it’s coming too late but I appreciate the fact that he’s apologizing and clearing the air. “I remember when it started,everybody was attacking me. “I have no idea why people always choose to attack the woman when a breakup or something happens. “But that was life. I went through it and I was strong enough to ignore all the negative comments,” she said.
