Super Eagles winger, Samuel Chukwueze, netted once as Villarreal were held to a 4-4 draw by Granada, in their opening LaLiga fixture on Saturday night. Chukwueze played the entire 90 minutes, as both teams settled for a share of the spoils at the Estadio de la Ceramica. The 20-year-old found the back of the net in the 73rd minute with a left-footed finish to give the hosts a 4-2 lead. The Yellow Submarines however conceded twice shortly after. Villarreal will hope to claim their first win of the season, when they visit Levante in their next league outing on August 23.
