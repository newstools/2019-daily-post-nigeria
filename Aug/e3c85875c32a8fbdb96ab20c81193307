Manchester United ended their interest in Bruno Fernandes, because they were worried the midfielder loses possession too much, ESPN reports. United looked at Fernandes as a potential option to boost their midfield, after an impressive season that saw the Portugal international score 31 goals for Sporting Lisbon. However, the club’s recruitment team voiced concerns about the 24-year-old’s passing statistics, before deciding he did not fit in with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s possession-based style of football. The Red Devils also became frustrated at the amount of speculation in Portugal, about a possible move for Fernandes. Old Trafford chiefs believe Sporting tried to drive up the price, by over-stating interest from the Premier League. Tottenham and Liverpool were also linked with moves.
