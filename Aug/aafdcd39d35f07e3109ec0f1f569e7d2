The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has urged government officials travelling abroad to inform the ministry and Nigerian missions in destination countries of their travel schedules to ensure their security and safety. Mr Ferdinard Nwonye, spokesperson for the Ministry, made this known in a statement to NAN on Wednesday in Abuja. DAILY POST reports that this advice follows the attack on former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) on Aug. 17 in Nuremberg, Germany. Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB leader, had also threatened an attack on government officials especially those from the Southeast visiting any country abroad, placing a N1million reward on credible information regarding their itinerary. Speaking on Wednesday, Nwonye said, “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has condemned in the strongest terms the attack on former Deputy Senate President, Dr Ike Ekweremadu, who was attending the 2nd Annual Igbo Cultural Festival organised by the Ndi-Igbo Community in Nuremberg, Germany. “The Ministry wishes to empathize with the Distinguished Senator, as well as remind all dignitaries to endeavor to bring to the notice of the Ministry and Missions their impending travel schedules. “This is to enable the Ministry thoroughly scrutinize the security status of the organisations inviting them for the meeting, and to make adequate preparation. “As well as concrete steps to ensure that host law enforcement agencies are on hand to guarantee their comprehensive security. “This advice is not to monitor their activities but to ensure their safety,” Nwonye added. He however assured Nigerians that government would work with relevant authorities in Germany to ensure that the perpetrators of the act were brought to book to serve as deterrence to others.
