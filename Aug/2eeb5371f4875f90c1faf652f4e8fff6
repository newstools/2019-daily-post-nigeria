Big Brother Naija housemate, Gedoni, has given reasons for celebrating his eviction. DAILY POST recalls that after Gedoni was evicted, he had said “Thank you” immediately Ebuka mentioned his name for eviction. This, however, did not go down well with Khafi, as she broke down in uncontrollable tears and was comforted by Tacha, Mike and other housemates. Reacting on Monday, Gedoni on his Twitter page said he had decided to thank God whether he was evicted or not. He said, “I knelt down in thanks because I had decided to thank God if evicted or saved.” Meanwhile, Gedoni also denied having sex with Khafi. According to him, Khafi has been celibate for eight years.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
