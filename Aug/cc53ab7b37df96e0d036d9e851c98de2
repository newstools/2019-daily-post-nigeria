Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, is facing a goalkeeper crisis, ahead of their Premier League clash away to Southampton this Saturday, the UK Mirror reports. Adrian, who was brought in as cover to the injured Allisson Becker, was injured during a pitch invasion after Wednesday’s UEFA Super Cup win over Chelsea. It has left Adrian with a race against time to be fit for this weekend’s trip to St. Marys. The Spaniard was treated for up to three hours on the flight back home by team doctors. Alisson is likely to be out for at least two more weeks. That leaves only 35-year-old veteran Andy Lonergan and youngster Caoimhin Kelleher, who has just returned from injury himself, as Klopp’s available options.
