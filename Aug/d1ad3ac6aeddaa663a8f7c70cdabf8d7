Former Manchester City striker, Mario Balotelli, will return to Etihad in September. The club made the announcement Tuesday night via their official website. The statement read: “Mario Balotelli will pull on the sky blue jersey one more time after being confirmed as a Manchester City Legend in Vincent Kompany’s September testimonial. “The Italian was a cult hero among City fans during his three-year stay between 2010 and 2013, making 80 appearances and scoring 30 goals and, unforgettably, assisting Sergio Aguero for the dramatic title-clinching goal against QPR. “Balotelli recently joined his hometown club Brescia. “Fittingly, Aguero and David Silva will also play a small part of the game after also being confirmed as part of Kompany’s City Legends squad. “Pep Guardiola will manage the City team and Belgium boss Roberto Martinez will coach the Premier League All-stars on Wednesday 11 September.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
