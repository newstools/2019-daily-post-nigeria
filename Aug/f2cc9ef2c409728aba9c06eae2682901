Former Manchester United defender, Gary Neville, has questioned Unai Emery’s decision to start a midfield diamond, in Arsenal’s defeat to Liverpool on Saturday and believes they looked better after switching to a 4-3-3. Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp, admitted he was “surprised” by Emery’s formation at the start of the match, though Liverpool quickly adapted, overloading the flanks. The Reds went on to win 3-1, thanks to goals from Joel Matip and Mohammed Salah (two). “The diamond was a big ask, and it had an element of risk with it particularly in terms of dealing with the full-backs of Liverpool. “The 4-3-3 they’ve now got out there, you wonder how it might have been if he’d have started with that. It looks a little bit better balanced. “There was a period where you just thought the wear on the legs [in the 4-4-2 diamond] was big, in terms of the fatigue setting in, and that does come from the side-to-side movement of chasing the ball,” Neville said on Sky Sports.
