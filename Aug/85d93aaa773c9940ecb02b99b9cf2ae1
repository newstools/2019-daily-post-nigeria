Gov. AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara has said that the government may institute legal action against some immediate-past public office holders over the illegal sales of government property in the state. He spoke in Ilorin, when the Committee On Sales and Disposal of government Properties submitted its final report to him. The governor Abdulrazaq said “I thank you for your time and the efforts put into the work.
“I went through the interim report and I am sure this final report would be an improvement on it.
“We would not discard the report because that would be a waste of your time and resources. We will definitely look at it. And we will find judicial solutions for the good of the state and Nigeria. “In the interim report, that you recently submitted,we saw some abnormalities which we will not allow to stand”. Governor Abdulrazaq said the committee might be called upon to make clarification as government looks through the report. Earlier, Senator Suleiman Ajadi, Chairman of the committee, told the governor that several frauds and mismanagement of public funds and properties were discovered, especially in the handling of the Micro, Small and Medium scale Enterprises funds, Harmony Holdings, and others. He urged the governor not to let the report end in the bin as it might mean the loss of at least N5bn allegedly mismanaged through the SMEs fund. Ajadi said “The committee observed unconscionable and immoral use of public funds to buy luxury cars, which flies in the face of the poverty being faced by our people, especially because of the several months of unpaid salaries”.
