The Lagos State Police Command has released the 123 male passengers that were intercepted along Moshalashi road, Agege alongside 48 motorcycles that were coming from Jigawa State. DAILY POST reported earlier that one hundred and twenty three petty traders from Northern part of the country have been detained by Lagos State government. The Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bala Elkana in an earlier statement said that a truck, with Registration Number JIGAWA HJA-680-XA, conveying the male passengers and motorcycles was on Friday, intercepted and searched. He said that the vehicle and passengers were searched but nothing incriminating was found. “They were profiled with a view to ascertaining who they were, where they come from, their background and their mission in Lagos. “They all came from Jigawa State, North West Region of Nigeria and are mostly artisans, commercial motorcyclists and traders. “Some of them are already based in Lagos with their families while others are coming for the first time. They are in the state in pursuit of greener pasture,” Elkana said. He said that the Police was satisfied with their legitimate mission in the state and allowed them to proceed to their various destinations.
