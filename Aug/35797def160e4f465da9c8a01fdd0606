The 2019 edition of the Big Brother Naija, BBNaija reality show, ‘Pepper Dem’ gang witnessed another romantic moment on Thursday night. This time around, Jackye who is a close friend with Mike in the house was caught on top of him while he was in bed. It all happened after the Cruisetopia team lost their Thursday night challenge to the Icons. Mike who was tired of playing Ludo game in the garden retired to his bed to sleep but Jackye chased him to his bed. Jackye climbed on top of Mike’s body while he was in bed, playing, touching him and disturbing him not to sleep. Some BBNaija fans alleged that she touched his manhood in the process of playing with him on the bed. Mike, who is one of the strong contenders of BBNaija ‘Pepper Dem’ edition is married. Ike, in the process, warned Jackye to stay off Mike and remember that he’s married.
