Barcelona will return with a third offer for Neymar, ESPN reports. And it is believed that the Spanish giants will offer Ousmane Dembele as a makeweight, in an attempt to convince Paris Saint-Germain to sell. Barca have already seen two bids turned down for Neymar, who left the club for France in a world record €222million transfer in 2017. PSG rejected a first offer which included Philippe Coutinho, Ivan Rakitic and €80m. The Ligue 1 champions also turned down their request to take him on loan this season, ahead of a permanent move next summer, in a deal which would have been worth around €190m. With less than two weeks to go before the transfer window closes on September 2, Barca are against the clock to come up with an offer which suits PSG.
