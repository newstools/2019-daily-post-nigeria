The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has owned up the attack on the former Deputy Senate President, Chief Ike Ekweremadu earlier today in Germany. DAILY POST had reported that Ekweremadu was dragged around and stoned with different objects, around the venue of the event. The lawmaker was later whisked away in a car, after several attempts to stop him from escaping. In the video, one of the attackers was heard saying “imagine, people are dying on a daily basis, people are wailing on a daily basis and we are here enjoying.” IPOB spoke in a statement titled: “Operation Python Dance instigator Ike Ekweremadu disgraced by IPOB Nuremberg Family”, signed by its media and publicity secretary, Mr. Emma Powerful. It read: Today being the 17th day of August 2019 the Nuremberg IPOB family in Germany in keeping with the long standing directive from our leader to hound all instigators of Operation Python Dance, is glad to report that Ike Ekweremadu was confronted and duly hounded out of a so-called New Yam Festival event in Germany. Despite repeated warnings to the organisers of these jamborees that Enugu, Ebonyi and other parts of Biafraland is under siege by Fulani caliphate and their collaborators within, they went ahead to invite a known traitor, co-conspirator and one of those that worked with Igbo governors to proscribe and tag IPOB a terror organisation while they never raised any voice against murderous Fulani herdsmen. This should serve as a warning to Nnia Nwodo, Dave Umahi, Okezie Ikpeazu, Willie Obiano and co that any day we find them in a public event abroad, they will be humiliated. IPOB is strategically located in over 100 countries around the world. Anywhere we find them, they will be dealt with.
