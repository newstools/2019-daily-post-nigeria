Manchester United legend, Ryan Giggs has disclosed what he told Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer about Forward Daniel James. Giggs said he told Solskjaer that James is a player with plenty of potentials after the Man United boss enquired about the 21-year-old before signing him from Swansea City. James, who becomes Solskjaer’s first signing at Old Trafford, joined the club from Swansea in the summer transfer window. The Wales international scored his first goal for the club in Man United’s 4-0 victory over Chelsea in the Premier League two days ago. Giggs, who gave James his full international debut as Wales’s boss, told Premier League Productions: “Ole asked me about Daniel James and I just told him that he is a player with plenty of potential. “He’s really quick, a great lad, someone who you want in the dressing room, a great character. So, it was a no-brainer really, because he is a talent. “From a standing start, he is quick and he will beat anyone,” Giggs added “It’s just that, like any other young winger, the finishing touches, that final ball, scoring more goals, which he will get better at. “I watched him a lot for Swansea last year and he ripped nearly every full-back in that division apart.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
