The Prelate of Methodist Church, Nigeria, Dr Samuel Uche, has disclosed that he instructed his members across the country to vote for performing governors during the last general elections. Uche, who made the disclosure on Tuesday in Abakaliki during a courtesy visit to Gov. David Umahi, said that his instruction was without regard to any party. The prelate said that the message was passed through his bishops, adding that one of those governors he instructed his members to return was Umahi. “We should project ourselves as Ibo people. Although I will not mention names, there are governors we are ashamed to say come from Igboland”, NAN quoted him as saying. “I am a core Igbo man and I am ready to defend their cause always and condemn issues of marginalisation and stigmatisation against them because not every Igbo man is bad. “We have respectable Igbo citizens and if the Federal Government wants peace and progress of the country, Igbos should be brought to the forefront of government,” he said. The cleric noted that he was the first Igbo man to occupy the position of the head of Methodist Church in Nigeria, 175 years after the establishment of the church. “We are in Ebonyi on an apostolic visit to the grassroots to see our members and empower them, the affluent, the not too affluent and the less-privileged among others. “We will also pray for them to have divine touch in their lives for the desired peace, progress and spiritual uplift,” he said.
