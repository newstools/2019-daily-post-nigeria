Romelu Lukaku has aimed a dig at Manchester United, by claiming that he is now doing “real work” at Inter Milan. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer decided to sell the Belgium striker this summer, as United agreed a £74million deal with the Serie A club. Lukaku played no part in United’s pre-season campaign this summer, while the striker angered Solskjaer by posting running statistics from one of the team’s training sessions on social media. And now Lukaku risks upsetting United even further, as he has insinuated that Inter’s training sessions are tougher than those under Solskjaer at United. “It’s hard, man. It’s different. “In England, it’s a lot of work, but here it’s real work,” Lukaku told Otro. Lukaku also indicated that he has been put on a stricter diet. When he was asked about the Italian food he has eaten so far he replied: “Salad.” Lukaku managed to score four goals in an 8-0 victory against Serie D minnows Bergamo.
