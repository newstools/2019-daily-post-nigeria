Paris Saint-Germain will move for Tottenham Hotspur midfielder, Christian Eriksen, if the sale of Neymar goes through this week, according to Le Parisien. Neymar has been pushing for a return to LaLiga all summer, with former club Barcelona battling rivals Real Madrid for his signature. It is believed PSG have agreed a fee with Barca, with the structure of payments the only delay. The Ligue 1 champions have now drawn up a three-man shortlist, in anticipation of Neymar’s departure and Eriksen’s name is included. Spurs are currently sweating over the future of the Danish playmaker, who is into the final year of his contract and has shown a reluctance to renew. Although Eriksen is keen on Barcelona or Real Madrid, he might have to settle for PSG.
