Nigerian football star, Victor Osimhen, on Wednesday, shot a brace as Lille cruised to a simple 3-0 win over Saint-Etienne in French Ligue 1. Osimhen’s brace took him to the top of the Ligue 1 scoring charts as his tally rose to four goals from the season’s opening three matches. The 20-year-old fired in the hosts’ opener shortly before the break and sealed the points with a fine turn-and-strike 15 minutes from the end. Lille’s Jonathan Bamba had added the second from the spot six minutes earlier after being upended by Mathieu Debuchy. Osimhen’s side sit on six points after their second straight home win, level with five clubs including champions Paris Saint-Germain. Saint-Etienne, who drop down to 13th after their first defeat of the new campaign, were left to rue a penalty award being chalked off by VAR in the 80th minute. The VAR footage showed that Lille’s Jonathan Ikone had touched the ball with his shoulder rather than his arm.
