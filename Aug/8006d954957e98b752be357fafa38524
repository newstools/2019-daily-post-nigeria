Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, is still optimistic the board can seal a deal to bring in Paul Pogba, before the September 2 transfer deadline, Marca reports. The Pogba speculation have refused to go all summer, but the midfielder is still at Old Trafford, with no sign of him moving. United do not want to sell and set a huge asking price of $200m (£180m), which Madrid could not meet. However, Zidane is still adamant that he wants the deal to be done. He is even willing to sacrifice other targets, to bring in Pogba. Ajax midfielder Donny van de Beek and Tottenham’s Christian Eriksen are alternatives to Pogba and both would be significantly easier deals to do. It is claimed “either could arrive in Spain tomorrow if he [Zidane] gave the thumbs up”, but Pogba is who Zidane wants.
