No fewer than One-Hundred and Twenty suspected cultists who were identified to be terrorizing the people of Ebonyi State have at the weekend denounced their membership. It was gathered that the said cultists who hail from the 13 Local Government Areas of the State, were told to converged at the State headquarters of the Christ Embassy church located at old Abakaliki- Enugu road. An eyewitness who spoke to newsmen and a prominent leader of the church said the suspected cultists willingly accepted to denounce their membership shortly after listening to the State Pastor of Christ Embassy church, Mrs. Eunice Oyeyemi. He said: “Cult members denounced their membership and immediately got baptized in Christ Embassy. They confessed their willingness to renounce cult activities. “They fully accepted Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior and immediately, they were baptized and promised never to engage in such ugly activities. ” I sincerely wish to applaud the Governor for this great initiative of changing destinies and lives for Ebonyians. To me, this is the best gift ever. “There’s a great joy when a sinner repent. Talk to that boy close to his early grave in your various villages and bring them to church for rehabilitation,” he stated. Investigation revealed that the denouncing of membership by the said cultists was unconnected with the directive of the governor, Chief David Umahi, that anyone who will be appointed into his new cabinet must denounce cultism. Recall that, some persons who denounced their membership in cultism last two months, got appointment from the state government. DAILY POST gathered that next week Thursday, another set of suspected cultists will denounce their membership and will receive baptism at the same venue.
