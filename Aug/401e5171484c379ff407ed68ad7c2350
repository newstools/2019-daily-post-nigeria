The Vice Chancellor of the Federal University Oye-Ekiti, Prof. Kayode Soremekun has said that Nigerian universities have been over unionised and that the development is distracting the managements of the universities from adequately discharging their duties. The VC, who identified poor financial resources of the country as reason for what he described as militant staff unionism on campuses, said it has been difficult for the country to meet up with the huge demands of universities’ staff because the income being generated is a mismatch to the expenditure. He made the remarks on Monday while addressing newsmen during the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 Combined Convocation Ceremony of the institution which held at the VC’s conference hall of the university. Soremekun said, “Nigerian universities are over unionised and this is distracting the administrations of the institutions. This is because Nigeria is poor and our income is struggling to meet up with huge expenditure: There is a mismatch between income and expenditure. The macro environment needs to change to favour the system and only then will militant unionism that results in tigerized demands will end.” Speaking about the Convocation ceremony, he said FUOYE is graduating a total of 1000 students from five faculties of Agriculture, Arts, Engineering, Science and Social Sciences.” On the graduating students’ academic performance, he added that: “A total of 35 First Class degrees in both sessions, 366 Second Class Upper, 472 Second Class lower, 119 in Third Class degrees and 8 in Pass.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
