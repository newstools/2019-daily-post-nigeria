Former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode (FFK) has cautioned the newly appointed ministers against poor performance in office. According to him, any minister who failed to perform would feel the ‘wrath’ of his pen. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari swore in 43 ministers on Wednesday afternoon. Reacting to the swearing-in, Fani-Kayode pointed out that he will put his contempt and disdain of President Buhari aside when assessing the performance of the ministers. He wrote on his Twitter handle, “I will judge each of Buhari’s Ministers based on their performance and not based on my disdain and contempt for his administration. “Any Minister, whether friend or foe, that performs well will receive my commendation or support, and any that does not will get hell from my pen.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
