Shehu Sani, immediate past Kaduna Central Senator, has called on the Federal Government to ensure that the Nigeria Correctional Services operate according to new standards. Sani made the call in response to the change of name from Nigeria Prisons Services. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari had signed the Nigerian Correctional Service Bill into law.  Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters (Senate), Ita Enang disclosed this to newsmen on Wednesday. The Act repeals the Nigerian Prisons Service Act. The Nigerian Prisons Service will now be called the Nigerian Correctional Service. Reacting to the development, Sani, in a tweet wrote: “The Change from Nigeria Prisons Services to Nigeria Correctional Services is a welcome development. Next is to ensure it’s operated in tune with its new status.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
