It has been revealed what Chelsea legend, John Terry told his former teammate and now manager, Frank Lampard before their 4-0 defeat to Manchester United on Sunday. It was the worst start Lampard could have imagined in life as Chelsea boss. Before the game, Terry had posted, “Good Luck Frank Lampard, Jody Morris, Petr Cech and EVERYONE at Chelsea” on Instagram. A 4-0 thrashing against Manchester United ensured that Lampard’s first trip to Old Trafford in charge of the Blues quickly became a nightmare and one he will be keen to move on from as soon as possible. Marcus Rashford scored a brace while Anthony Martial and Daniel James also got on the scoresheet. On his part, ex-captain, Terry was also on the losing side as he was part of the Aston Villa coaching staff and was on the bench as the newly-promoted side were beaten 3-1 by Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. Even with that loss still fresh in his mind, Terry showed his class by taking to Instagram to send a message to Lampard, Jody Morris and Petr Cech ahead of kick-off at Old Trafford.
