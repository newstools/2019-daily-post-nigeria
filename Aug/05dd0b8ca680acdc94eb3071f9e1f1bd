Manchester United have offered Ex-Tottenham Hotspur striker, Fernando Llorente a two-year contract. According to Gazzetta dello Sport, Man United are keen on strengthening their attacking options ahead of the likely departure of Alexis Sanchez, who is set to leave the club before September 2 transfer deadline. Llorente could be a perfect replacement for Sanchez at Old Trafford after helping Tottenham to reach last season’s UEFA Champions League final. DAILY POST had reported that Sanchez is set to join Inter Milan on a season long-loan deal from Man United. Llorente is currently a free agent after leaving Tottenham at the end of last season after his contract with the club expired on July 1. The 34-year-old scored 13 goals in 66 appearances for Spurs during his two-year spell at Mauricio Pochettino’s side.
