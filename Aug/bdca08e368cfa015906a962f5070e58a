Lecturers of the Federal College of Agriculture, Akure, FECA on Monday kicked against the appointment of Dr. Fadiyimu Akinyemi, as the new Acting Provost of the institution. Bearing placards with various inscriptions, the protesting lecturers who described Fadiyimu’s appointment as illegal and unconstitutional, faulted the institution’s governing council for approving the appointment of Fadiyimu. Some of the inscriptions on the placards read, “Dissolve FECA Governing Board Now”,” Save FECA from Collapse”, “Call ARCN to Order” and “Corruption in FECA, FG Probe FECA” According to the lecturers, Fadiyimu is not qualified for the post, stressing that he is not the most senior officer in the college. The aggrieved lecturers said the protest would continue until the appointment of Fadiyimu who was appointed last week Friday as the institution’s acting provost is reversed. Reacting to the protest against his appointment, Fadiyimu said that, “They are bound to be different opinions and views because we have freedom of expression to air our thoughts. But I must tell you that we have other two unions in the college that are not protesting and they are at their duty posts,” he said.
