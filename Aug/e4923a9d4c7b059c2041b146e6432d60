Ex BBNaija housemate, Gedoni Ekpata, on Tuesday said he thinks housemate, Mercy Eke was playing the best game. Gedoni shared his thoughts on fellow housemates’ strategies in an interview with Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, host of the show on Tuesday. According to him, ‘he likes Mercy’s game and looking back, he would like a woman to win the 2019 season. When asked by Ebuka who was the worst game player, Gedoni, who had earlier predicted that Mike might win the season, said that he feels Seyi Awolowo has the worst game. He said, “Seyi is playing the worst game. I don’t know but Seyi is not giving himself. “He is not putting himself out there as much as he should. That’s what I think but I will vote for him anytime any day. DAILY POST reports that Gedoni was evicted during the last eviction show alongside Jackye Madu, a tech entrepreneur.
