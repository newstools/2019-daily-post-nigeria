Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has heaped praises on Forward Anthony Martial, after his brilliant performance in the Red Devils’ Premier League 1-1 draw with Wolves at Molineux on Monday night. He also explained Goalkeeper David De Gea’s Man United captaincy. Anthony Martial’s first-half goal was cancelled out by Ruben Neves after the break. United had the chance to take all three points, after the referee, awarded a penalty. Pogba stepped up after discussing with Rashford and saw his kick saved by Rui Patricio. “Martial can finish with either right or left foot. It was a good run down the side and a good pass so all over that was a very, very good goal,” Solskjaer was quoted by Man United’s official website as saying. “He was clinical which we know we have to be because at this level you’ve got to take your chances.” “David’s wearing the armband because at the moment he is very much a leader in that group and he knows that we value him as one.” Man United will now tackle Crystal Palace in their next Premier League fixture on August 24.
