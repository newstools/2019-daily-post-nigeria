Joe Igbokwe, the Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Lagos State, has said that only “liars from the pit of hell” would say President Muhammadu Buhari has not done well. Igbokwe, who appeared on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Monday, made the remark while urging Nigerians to support the Buhari-led administration. The APC chieftain also blamed the nation’s challenges on the previous administrations, starting from 1999. He said: “You (PDP) were there for 16 years and we didn’t see anything. In the midst of plenty, I cannot lay my hands on anything. “Support your leader, don’t be a distraction. Anybody who tells you Buhari is not doing well is a liar from the pit of hell given where we are coming from.” This is coming at a time, when a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Ken Okolugbo said the APC led-Federal Government has not fared well in delivering it’s electoral promises. “I will never give a pass mark, the only pass mark I will give is in terms of security. And our security is in tatters now. “On the issues of corruption, I have always said it that there is favouritism. Though they have made a significant progress, a lot of money has been recovered,” he said.
