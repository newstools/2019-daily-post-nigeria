Nigerian youngster, Bukayo Saka, trained with Arsenal’s first-team at London Colney on Friday afternoon, ahead of Saturday’s Premier League clash against Burnley. This is the second successive day Saka has been invited to train by manager Unai Emery. During Friday’s session, the young forward wore a white bib and trained with the number 77 shirt. The 17-year-old worked his way through the age groups at the Arsenal Academy, before making his maiden appearance for the first team in November 2018. Saka also played five matches for Arsenal in pre-season. With the likes of Nicolas Pépé, Alexandre Lacazette, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Reiss Nelson fit, his chances of featuring in the Gunners’ first home fixture are slim.
