President Muhammadu Buhari has suspended the Chairman of the Special Investigation Panel for the Recovery of Public Property, Mr Okoi Obono-Obla. His suspension is to take effect immediately until completion of the ongoing investigations by ICPC. This was disclosed in a series of tweets on the verified page of the Nigeria President. The post read: “President Buhari has directed the suspension from office, with immediate effect, of the Chairman of the Special Investigation Panel for the Recovery of Public Property, Mr Okoi Obono-Obla. “The suspension shall be in effect until the conclusion of ongoing @ICPC_PE investigations into a number of cases relating to Mr. Obono-Obla.” DAILY POST recalls that the Nigerian Police earlier sealed the office of Obono-Obla. The sealing of his office comes on the heels of his rumoured sack as the chairman of the panel on recovery of public property. The seal-off of Obono-Obla’s office was confirmed by the Police Force Public Relations Officer, DCP Frank Mba, who explained that the action was carried out based on a complaint said to have emanated from the Federal Government.
