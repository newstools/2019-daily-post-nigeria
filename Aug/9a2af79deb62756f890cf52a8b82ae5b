Ivorian artiste, Ange Didier Huon, aka DJ Arafat, is dead. He was involved in a road accident in Abidjan, according to TheAfricaReport. Arafat died from his injuries on Monday at the Polyclinique des Deux Plateaux in Abidjan. His motorcycle crashed into a car driven by a Radio Côte d’Ivoire journalist. “He was admitted to the emergency room in a vegetative state. He had a skull fracture and oedema,” a doctor from the institution told Jeune Afrique on condition of anonymity. He added that the medical teams tried to revive him, but “in vain”. “I’m at the clinic where DJ Arafat was admitted. I can confirm that the artist has passed away. I am with Minister of State Hamed Bakayoko to organize with the family,” said Maurice Bandaman, Ivorian Minister of Culture and Francophonie. Born in 1986 in Yopougon, a town in western Abidjan, the artist liked to claim new nicknames from “Commander Zabra” to “Yorobo” – more recently, he even introduced himself as “Leader of People’s China”. Meanwhile, David Adeleke aka Davido has mourned the deceased. “RIP YOROBO I LOVE YOU!”, the Nigerian suspertar tweeted Monday afternoon.
