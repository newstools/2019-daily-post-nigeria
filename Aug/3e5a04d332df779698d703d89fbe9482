Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Seyi has apologized to Mike and other Cruisetopia teammembers. Seyi had on Thursday during rehearsal for the task given to them by Biggie got into an argument with Mike which did not go down well with other housemates. Mike confronted Seyi, urging him to act like a leader and stop being ‘hypersensitive’. Seyi, after the task which had ‘The Icons’ declared as winners, apologized to his team members and Mike for walking out on the group due to his argument with Mike. He said he went to sleep during the rehearsals because he did want his argument with Mike to take another dimension. Seyi, however, promised to henceforth support the team and participate in preparing for any task ahead.
