Over 350 houses have been destroyed following flood disaster that hit Ngelzarma town in Fune Local Government area of Yobe State on Thursday. The Executive Secretary, Yobe State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Dr. Mohammed Goje confirmed the incident to newsmen while on an assessment tour of the damages done to the community by the flood. “The impact of destruction at Ngelzarma flood is more than what took place at Ngalda last week, where over 300 houses including farmlands were also washed away”, he said. The State Deputy Governor Idi Barde Gubana has since paid a sympathy visit to the community and commiserated with the people over their losses. Gubana, who said the state government will set up a stakeholders’ committee to advise government on the long term solution of the problem, regrettably noted that the problem of flood in Ngelzarma town had been on since 1976. He, however, directed SEMA to supply 150 bags of rice, 50 gallons of cooking oil for distribution to the affected victims in order to lessen their hardship. DAILY POST had reported that, last week, flood caused by a heavy downpour had destroyed over 300 houses, in addition to submerging of farmlands and foodstuff in Ngalda town of Fika local government area of Yobe State.
