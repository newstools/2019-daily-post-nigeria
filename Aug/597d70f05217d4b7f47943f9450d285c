Here are some comments gathered by DAILY POST from Twitter: @_Omoissy “Gedoni saying “Thank you” after being evicted is the highlight of this season.” @Entr_Profiler “Gedoni kneeling down and saying thank you after getting evicted has to be disrespectful to Khafi.“ @_imabe “This BBNaijaEviction, Big brother just did Khafi a huge favour! @Clairvoyant “Gedoni highlight is the most boring I’ve seen so far this season. Even Isilomo that spent one week had better moments. TUEH! Thanks biggie for taking down BBN most wanted.” @HaajiRoy “So no more overnight knacking for Khafi again.Uncle Gedoni is on his way home.” @AsiwajuDosunmu “Khafi is stronger than she thinks she is. Now, she needs someone like Tacha for some serious life coaching.” @Itz_desmond “This one Gedoni is happy he was evicted while Khaffi is the one crying…like he was irredeemably exhausted from the back to back “lashing” and inevitably needed a break.” @Shalom_samuel10 “Gedoni was happy to be evicted because he wants to reserve sperm he will use to start up a family.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
