The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Imo State has accused the immediate past Governor of the state, Rochas Okorocha of destroying all sectors of the state’s economy. Chairman of the party in the state, Charles Ezekwem made the allegation while stressing that the administration of Governor Emka Ihedioha inherited a devastated state. In a statement he signed, Ezekwem said it can only take a man of his experience and prudence to rebuild the ruins. Ezekwem said: “The Okorocha administration ruined all sectors of the state, leaving it broke and in a terrible shape. But, the governor is not relenting; he has taken up the enormous challenge of rebuilding the state. “If you drive around the state, you will observe that the entire roads are in terrible shape. The state was raped and left broke. The eight years of the APC government were the worst in the history of the state and nothing close to that will ever happen to our state. “It might shock you to know that the governor is still operating from a small apartment because the government house is in total ruins.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
