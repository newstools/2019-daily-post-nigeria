Former Chelsea and Leicester City defender, Robert Huth has said that he does not believe in the ability of Super Eagles star, Kelechi Iheanacho to replace England striker, Jamie Vaddy as Leicester City’s point man. He expressed his disappointment over the Foxes inability to sign a new striker who will serve as quality back-up to Vardy. The former Germany international who won the Premier League with Leicester, said the Foxes have to replace the England international who is no longer in blistering form He further questioned Iheanacho’s readiness to step into Vardy’s shoes when the Englishman retires from active football. “Eventually they are going to have to replace Vardy. I’m a little bit surprised they didn’t get in someone to kick him
up the backside, ” Huth told BBC Radio 5 Live. “With Iheanacho, he hasn’t done it yet, probably doesn’t look like he’s going to either, so I’m surprised they haven’t invested in that.” Following a blistering performance with Manchester City and the arrival of Pep Guardiola in 2017, Iheanacho joined the Foxes. He has, however, failed to justify his £25m price tag so far and was even dropped from Nigeria’s squad for the 2019 African Cup of Nations in Egypt.
