Everton boss, Marco Silva has provided an update on the fitness of Super Eagles forward, Alex Iwobi, ahead of Saturday’s Premier League clash away at Aston Villa. The manager suggested that Iwobi is not in tiptop condition because he did not take part in pre-season training before his move to The Toffees on deadline day. Iwobi was a non-playing substitute as Everton registered their first win of the new season against Watford and Silva. Asked if the Super Eagles star is looking forward to making his debut, Silva told pre-match press conference, ”Yes of course! For sure he’s looking forward to it, and we all are. “But he started really late, just now it’s his second week working with the team and he didn’t have a pre-season. “We have to take care of the situation giving him enough time to get fitter. “Of course if we need him during the games he is available to help us. Not for 90 minutes, but he’s getting better. If I decide, he’ll be ready to help.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
