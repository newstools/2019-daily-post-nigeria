Chairman of the Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Universities, SSANU, Ahmadu Bello University branch, Comrade Abdurra’uf Bello has warned that if the Federal Government failed to use the five-day warning strike granted to it by the association to implement the SSANU/FGN 2009 agreement, nothing will stop them from embarking on an indefinite strike. Abdurra’uf Bello, who handed this warning on Thursday at a press briefing held at the union’s secretariat at main campus, lamented that 10 years into the agreement, the better part of the agreement remained unattended to, by the Federal Government. He further stated that the most worrisome aspect of the agreement is the recent N25billion release by the Federal Government to universities to defray part of the outstanding Earned Allowances where only 20 per cent of the said amount was allocated to the non-teaching staff even as 80 per cent of the sum went to teaching staff. According to him, “This singular act by the government is not only embarrassing to the non-teaching staff of the Universities but is insulting, unfair and unacceptable.” On the issue of the industrial court ruling in Abuja, he said it is the responsibilities of the Federal Government to handle the recurrent and capital expenditures of University Staff School, adding that the federal government is yet to comply with the court ruling. Comrade Bello urged the Federal Government to see to the demands of the SSANU before the warning strike would snowball into an indefinite, comprehensive and total strike.
