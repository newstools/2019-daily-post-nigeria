A former lawmaker who represented Kaduna Central at the Senate, Shehu Sani has reacted to the threat by the Nnamdi Kanu-led Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, to attack and disgrace President Muhammadu Buhari in Japan. Buhari will depart Abuja Sunday for Japan to participate in the Seventh Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD7) holding in the City of Yokohama, August 28-30, 2019. Following the disclosure of Buhari’s trip, IPOB directed its members to ensure that the President was arrested and handed over to security agents because he’s an alleged impostor. Sani condemned the move, adding that attacking the President in Japan was not the right way for IPOB to express their grievance. The former lawmaker said instead, there should a peaceful protest against a derailing government. He tweeted, “Peaceful protest against Injustice, creeping autocracy, abuse of power and violations of fundamental rights anywhere challenged is right and legitimate. “However, the reported order to attack and disgrace the President in Japan is unreservedly condemned and falls short of civility.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
