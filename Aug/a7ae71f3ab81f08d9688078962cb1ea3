The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Adamawa state has appointed three officials in acting capacity to fill the vacancies left by suspended executive members. The party had last week suspended three of its executives, one indefinitely and two for six months. A press statement signed by the state Publicity Secretary of the party, Hon Mohammed Abdullahi, named Abdullahi Wali as an ex-Officio to coordinate the Adamawa Central Zone as acting Zonal Vice Chairman. Mr Medan Kaigama, who had been the Assistant Financial Secretary, is to serve as acting State Financial Secretary, while Mr David Majo, hitherto the party’s vice chairman in Mayo-Belwa Local Government Area, is to now function as the Acting Chairman for the LGA. The statement said all the appointments are with effect from August 16, 2019. DAILY POST recalls that Aliyu Bakari (Vice-Chairman Adamawa Central), Saidu Naira (Financial Secretary) and Babangida Talasai (party chairman of Mayo-Belwa) were suspended for allegedly attempting to withdraw a court case which the APC instituted against Governor Ahmadu Fintiri and his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the electoral tribunal in the state over PDP’s victory in the last governorship election.
