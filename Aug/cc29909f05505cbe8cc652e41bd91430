Marvin Records producer, Don Jazzy has reacted mockingly after a Big Brother Naija 2019 housemate, Frodd suddenly turned himself a laundry man for fellow housemate, Esther.
Frodd, who seems to be obsessed with his love for Esther, had on Tuesday told the female housemate that only her towel was left unwashed having washed every other thing for her, promising to wash the towel on Wednesday. This particular action by Frodd stirred reactions among BBNaija followers and Don Jazzy, who is a top fan of the reality show, as he mocked Frodd, calling him a ‘washerman’. Alongside a video of the Frodd revealing his intention to wash Esther’s towel, Don Jazzy tweeted, “Frodd my guy. Abeg what’s the name of Esther’s soap? #bbnaija #WasherMan.” DAILY POST recalls that Esther had earlier turned down Frodd’s proposal which pushed him to tears. Big Brother had also warned Frodd for attempting to touch Esther against her will on Saturday night. Frodd, after the Saturday night party, was seen on Esther’s bed without underwear while trying to touch and caress her body.
