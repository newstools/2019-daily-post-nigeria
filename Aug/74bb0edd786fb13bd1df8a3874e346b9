Cardinal John Onaiyekan, the Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, has accused politicians of praising terrorists and “warwongers” as national heroes. Onaiyekan said this while lamenting over the attitude of politicians who place personal ambitions above the welfare of Nigerians. He spoke at the 10th World Assembly of Religions for Peace, in Lindau, Germany, Wednesday. The clergyman also stated that recent developments in Nigeria and across the world have indicated that people were at a critical cross road. He said: “Our future can no longer be taken for granted. First, on the political front, it is pertinent to note that even today, many political leaders still eulogize warmongers and terrorists of the past, praised as national heroes and accorded the title ‘Great’. “Can we imagine what this is saying to the younger generation, dreaming of a peaceful future? But this is not just a matter of past history. “Even today, are we still not measuring greatness by military prowess, which often translates to economic domination and exploitation of others? Personal ambition must give way to a community of shared well-being of the human family “In this necessary change of heart, all other stakeholders must be involved— civil society, the business community, the industrial world, professions and the academia, everyone must play its respective role.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
