A Makurdi Magistrates’ Court on Monday ordered that a farmer, Terseer Angbee, who allegedly stabbed his colleague to death, be remanded in prison pending legal advice. NAN reports that Magistrate J. O Ayia, who gave the order, did not take the plea of Angbee because the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the suit. Anyia ordered the police to send the case file to the Benue Director of Public Prosecutions for legal advice. She adjourned the case until Aug. 26 for further mention. According to the Prosecution Counsel, Sgt. Godwin Ato, the case was reported by Mr Torngu Mwaikyoga of Tse Agu Mbajor Tombo at Buruku police station.

The offence, he said, contravened provisions of Section 222 of the Penal Code Law of Benue state, 2004 suggested.
