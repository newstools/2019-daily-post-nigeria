Everton boss, Marco Silva has given Nigeria’s Alex Iwobi five days to prove his fitness ahead of their next Premier League game against Watford on Saturday. Iwobi, who joined the club from Everton on transfer deadline day, faces an uphill task to be fit to face the Hornets. He did not play a part in Arsenal’s pre-season activities due to international commitments with the Super Eagles at the Africa Cup of Nations. Silva will begin running the rule over Iwobi when he reports for training at USM Finch Farm on Monday. Liverpool Echo quoted Silva as saying, ”He was on holiday after the Africa Cup. He starts on Monday and let’s see how he reacts but there is a big gap between him and his team-mates, the physical condition will be a big gap, but let’s see. “Normally my decisions are coming from the training sessions and let’s see how he will play, how he will do in the training sessions and after that I will take my decision on Friday.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
