Manchester United defender, Aaron Wan-Bissaka has predicted a tough clash when Ole Gunnar Solskajer’s men tackle Wolves in tonight’s Premier League fixture at Molineux. He also called on Man United players to give club fans something to celebrate when they clash with Nuno Espirito Santo’s side. The Red Devils head to the game following a 4-0 victory over Chelsea in their last Premier League encounter at Old Trafford. “It will be a tough game against Wolves, obviously, but there are a lot of positives from the Chelsea match we can take into it and there are a few areas where we can probably improve as well,” Wan-Bissaka told The Guardian. “What we have at United now is a good mix of young and experienced players and, speaking as one of the younger members of the squad, I think that’s important. “We need people to set the standards to live up to, to set the tempo in games when we need it and the more experienced players in the dressing room are capable of doing that. “I would like to thank the fans, too, for giving us such support. The crowd was amazing during the Chelsea game and I’ve heard great things about United’s away following as well. “Now it’s up to us to give them something to celebrate at Wolves.” Man United have not beaten Wolves in both side’s last three meetings in all competitions. The kick-off time for the match is 8pm. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
