Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemates, Seyi and Frodd on Friday night engaged in a heated argument, hauling insults at each other. It all started when Biggie provided alcohol for housemates after Friday arena games. Frodd queried Seyi over the availability of enough drinks and alcohol in the house, and the manner its distribution was being handled. Seyi who was not having it with Frodd said: “I’m a big man where I’m coming from, I can’t fight about alcohol. I’m bigger than it.” Frodd in response attacked Seyi, adding that he does not care about his lineage as they all have equal rights in the house. “Wetin you come dey do for here, you be big man, you con follow me come this place! “What is my business with your lineage? Seyi is the grandson to Obafemi Awolowo. DAILY POST recalls that Seyi had on Thursday during rehearsal for the task given to them by Biggie got into an argument with Mike which did not go down well with other housemates. Mike confronted Seyi, urging him to act like a leader and stop being ‘hyper-insensitive’.
