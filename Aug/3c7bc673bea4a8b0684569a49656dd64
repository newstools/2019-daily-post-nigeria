Former governor of old Kaduna State and immediate past national chairman of the Peoples Redemption Party, PRP, Alhaji Balarebe Musa has opined that the coming on board of former chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Professor Attairu Jega into the party is a welcomed development. The elder statesman who is now the chairman of the board of trustee of the party, however, said the party must view his coming into the party with care and caution. According to Alhaji Musa who bared his mind while fielding questions from members of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, Kaduna state council, said his position was premised on the fact that it was under the Chairmanship of the former INEC boss that the party was deregistered before it was re-registered on court orders. Recall that recently Professor Jega was announced as the Chairman of the SWOT analysis committee of the PRP whose mandate is to critically examine the strength of PRP, its weaknesses and the opportunities available to the party, as well as threats to its existence and wellbeing. Musa said he was not prepared to discuss the issue on the pages of papers but would rather meet with the National Executive Committee, NEC, of the party to take a holistic view of the whole matter on the new entrance into the party. On his Sallah message to Nigerians, the elder statesman called on Nigerians to unite, reconcile for peace and progress of the country, while acknowledging that the challenge of nation building is enormous and the need to address it is imperative. “There are so much negativity in the system, we need peace and progress, all hands, therefore, must positively be on deck to achieve it.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
