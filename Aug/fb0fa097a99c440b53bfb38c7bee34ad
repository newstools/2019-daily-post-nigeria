Real Madrid are ready to offer €100million and three players to sign Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain this summer, L’Equipe reports. Zinedine Zidane has spent over £300m already this summer but is still not satisfied with his squad. Los Blancos are now ready to give Gareth Bale, James Rodriguez and Keylor Navas plus cash at the Ligue 1 champions for Neymar. With Bale impressing Zidane, Madrid could yet throw Luka Jovic into the deal. Jovic has struggled to hit the ground running since his £62m summer move from Frankfurt after a difficult pre-season. The European transfer window closes September 2. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
