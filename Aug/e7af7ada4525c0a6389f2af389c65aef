Founder and General Overseer of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM), Dr. Daniel Kolawole Olukoya has disclosed that he received vision of the church while asleep in a one bedroom apartment in Lagos. He said this Saturday during the 30th year anniversary and international convention of MFM holding at its Prayer City, along Lagos -Ibadan Expressway. Olukoya spoke during a sermon he titled: “Rearranged for Revival”, which is also the theme of the convention. His words: “I was sleeping in my one-room apartment in the Boys Quarters of a house located on Herbert Macaulay Way, Yaba, in 1977, when I heard a sharp voice. “I then woke up and walked towards the door. But I did not see anybody. “Again, for the second time, the voice came and as I was whose it was, the Holy Spirit said: ‘son remember the call of Samuel’. “Then He started giving the covenant that led to the establishment of the MFM.” He also said though he got the messages and the covenant from God, the MFM was not founded until 12 years later. Olukoya encouraged worshippers and Nigerians to move closer to God to be able to overcome challenges.
