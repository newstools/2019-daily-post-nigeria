Former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose has reacted to the attack on the former deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, in Nuremberg Germany. DAILY POST had reported that Senator Ekweremadu, who was attending the 2nd Annual Igbo Cultural Festival as a speaker and special guest of honour at the event organised by the Ndi-igbo Germany community, was beaten up and publicly humiliated by suspected IPOB members in a viral video. Reacting, Fayose on his Twitter page described Ekweremadu’s attackers as ‘miscreants, adding that they do not swerve a place in a civilized society. He stated that the attack was an assault against the Igbos and Nigeria. Fayose said, “Attackers of Ekweremadu,a defender of democracy who symbolizes courage & decency, are miscrants who don’t deserve a place in a civilized society. “ It is an assault against the Igbos and Nigerians in general. To me, those “Igbo touts” demonstrated that pigs have no value for gold.” Meanwhile, the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB had owned up on the attack on the former Deputy Senate President. IPOB said the attack serves as a warning to Nnia Nwodo, Dave Umahi, Okezie Ikpeazu, Willie Obiano and others to stay away from any public event abroad unless they want to be humiliated.
