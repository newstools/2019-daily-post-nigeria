Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is prepared to send Alexis Sanchez to the reserves, if he fails to secure a move away from Old Trafford, according to the UK Sun. Sanchez has failed to impress since joining from Arsenal 19 months ago and his agent has already held talks with Inter Milan over a potential transfer earlier this summer. But the main stumbling block has been the Chilean’s wages, as he is earning a basic £400,000-a-week which is topped up by various bonuses, including a £75,000 appearance fee. Solskjaer is ‘desperate’ for Sanchez to quit United, as he does not have the 30-year-old in his plans. It is understood that the Norwegian has not been a fan of Sanchez, since he took over from Jose Mourinho in December.
