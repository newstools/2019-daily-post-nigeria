Evicted Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate, Enkay has tendered an unreserved apology to Nigerians over her actions towards Cindy. DAILY POST recalls that Cindy had approached Enkay to join her in a Ludo game, but Enkay blatantly refused, instead chose to play alone. The incident won sympathy votes for Cindy to the detriment of Enkay, who was evicted on Sunday, scoring the lowest number of votes. Upon eviction, Enkay realizing why she scored lower votes, apologised to Nigerians in a video on her Instagram page for her attitude towards Cindy. She said she did not intentionally reject or look down on Cindy lastweek. According to her, “My attitude to Cindy was just a misunderstanding, it was absolutely nothing personal. “I am not a condescending person, I will never look down on anyone, I am as humble as I can be. “I apologise to anyone that felt I did try to look down on Cindy.” VIDEO:   A post shared by Ede Nkechinyere (@theenkayofficial) on Aug 19, 2019 at 11:04am PDT  Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
