Kayode Adetayo, a 37-year-old company manager, who allegedly stole N5.38 million from his employer’s safe, on Thursday appeared in a Yaba Chief Magistrates’ court in Lagos. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Adetayo, who resides in Ado-Ekiti, is charged with two counts of conspiracy and theft. He pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Prosecution Counsel, Sgt. Modupe Olaluwoye told the court that the defendant committed the offence between January and May at the company in Ado-Ekiti. She alleged that the defendant and his accomplice, the company’s cashier, who is at large, stole N5.38million, being proceeds from the employer’s safe. The prosecution told the court that the company’s auditor, Mr Sunday Ifenkwe, discovered the theft and financial discrepancy from the company’s branch finances during routine checks.
