The Arewa Consultative Forum, ACF, has said that power shift in 2023 will be determined by the decision of any political party fielding its candidate from any part of the country. Speaking through its Secretary General, Anthony Sani, in an interview with the Sun, the ACF noted that zoning is not a constitutional matter but mere gentleman agreement by political parties. Sani said he sees no wisdom in the controversy as to where the president should come from in 2023, adding that such should be left to the political parties to decide. “Nigerians must note that such politics of identity is not a constitutional matter but mere gentleman agreement by political parties. And that explains why out of the 76 presidential candidates in the last elections, only six were northerners. “And since we are in a multiparty democracy, each political party is at liberty to develop its winning game plan. “I do not see how anybody can prevent a political party from presenting its flag bearer from the South, if its judgement says that is the winning game plan. “I therefore see no wisdom in the controversy as to where the president should come from in 2023. That should be left to the political parties to decide. “If a political party’s winning game plan favours the South and majority of Nigerians support it, so be it. After all, it was such revolution that unseated President Jonathan in 2015.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
