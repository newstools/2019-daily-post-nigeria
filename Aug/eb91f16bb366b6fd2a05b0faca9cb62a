Liverpool legend, Jamie Carragher has urged the club to sign Leicester City star, James Maddison, in the next transfer window. Maddison has been impressive for Leicester since joining the club from Norwich City last summer in a £20million deal. “I think James Maddison is the one player outside of the top six who Liverpool should be looking at,” Carragher told Sky Sports. “People have been talking about Coutinho coming back, but obviously, that hasn’t happened as he’s gone to Bayern Munich, but if you’re looking in the Premier League, yes he will cost a lot of money, but he should be the one Liverpool are looking at if you’re going to that next step up.” Maddison was outstanding in Leicester City’s Premier League 1-1 draw with Chelsea last Sunday. The 22-year-old will hope to lead the Foxes to victory when they take on Sheffield United this weekend in their next Premier League clash.
