Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has insisted that winger, Gareth Bale is going to stay at the club following his side’s La Liga 3-1 victory over Celta Vigo on Saturday. He also said that the red card midfielder, Luka Modric had during the match, will not affect his side’s midfield in their next league game against Valladolid. Zidane, however, said his players did well to get all three points against Celta Vigo. Goals from Karim Benzema, Toni Kroos and Lucas Vazquez gave the Los Blancos all three points against Celta Vigo. “Bale is going to stay. Every single player we have here gives us reasons to think positively about the team,” Zidane told reporters after the match. “We have to focus on our current season. Hazard’s injury is very bad luck and it did not change the plans we had for Bale. Gareth, James and everybody who’s with us will defend this shirt as it deserves to be defended. “We completed a very good game from the get go. Also when we were down to 10 men. We struggled to get this result and we’re satisfied and happy. There won’t be many teams capable of winning here. Our preseason was tough but we worked well knowing that the important thing was the real competition.” Zidane added: “It’s tough to play away and we played a complete game. We did well all game long and I appreciate the effort everyone put in. Vini and Gareth’s defensive work was crucial, and the same can be said about Lucas and Isco’s. Everyone played well defensively and we know what we can do offensively. “We are not worried about Modric’s red card. We will handle the season with what we have. We have the players to take care of it.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
