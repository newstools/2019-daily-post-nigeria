Tottenham Hotspur, Mauricio Pochettino, has admitted there are no excuses for losing 1-0 to Newcastle in the Premier League on Sunday. Joelinton’s first goal for the Magpies, gave Steve Bruce’s men a first-half lead to defend. And they did so, to pick up their first points of the season. “It’s easy (to analyse), we didn’t play well. I’m very disappointed about our performance and our result. “Again we concede a very cheap goal in the first half and then it was difficult. “We weren’t capable to break down their organisation. We created some chances but not enough. We cannot justify our performance. We needed more desire, more aggression with the ball,” Pochettino told reporters after the game.
