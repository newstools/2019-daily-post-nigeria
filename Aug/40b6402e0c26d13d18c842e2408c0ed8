The Kogi State Chief Judge, Justice Nasir Ajanah on Monday inaugurated a seven-man panel to investigate the allegation of gross misconduct against the State Deputy Governor, Elder Simon Achuba. The State Assembly had two weeks ago asked the Chief Judge to investigate allegations of gross misconduct against the Deputy Governor, following series of press interviews where he accused Governor Yahaya Bello of withholding his impress and allowances since 2017. The seven-man panel are: John Baiyeshe (Chairman) with Hon. Justice S.S Idajili (retd), Barrister U.O. Onoja esq as members. Other members of the panel are: Venerable Z.A. Asun, Barrister E.I. Omuya esq, Dr Ibrahim Ndagi Adamu, Ada Shuaibu and Bamidele Aina esq who will serve as the panel’s secretary. Speaking at the inauguration ceremony, Justice Ajanah said they were appointed based on their unquestionable integrity, adding that they should bring it to bear in the discharge of their duties. While noting that the task to investigate the Deputy Governor was in line with section 188 of the 1999 constitution as amended, Justice Ajanah charged the panel to carry out their assignment without fear or favour. “The basic rule of fair hearing must be sacrosanct in your proceedings. I have no doubt you will discharge this duty which you owe God and Kogi State, meritoriously,” he stated. In his acceptance speech, the Chairman of the panel, John Baiyeshea SAN stressed that the assignment must and shall be conducted within national and international best practices of natural justice of equity. DAILY POST reports that by virtue of section 188(7)(b) of the 1999 constitution, the panel is expected to submit their report to the Kogi State House of Assembly within three months.
