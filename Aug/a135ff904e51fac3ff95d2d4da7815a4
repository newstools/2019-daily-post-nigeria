Manchester City midfielder, Kevin De Bruyne, has admitted he is struggling to understand the rule change on handball. De Bruyne was speaking after Gabriel Jesus’ dramatic stoppage-time effort, was disallowed by Video Assistant Referee (VAR) for handball against Aymeric Laporte. The Belgian is surprised that it would not have been a penalty to City, had a Tottenham player accidentally handled the ball as Laporte did. According to Law 12, VAR ruled out Jesus’ effort because Laporte’s handball directly led to a goal, even though it was unintentional. “I’m old fashioned and I’m not the biggest pro-VAR. “I was told after the game that if it had hit a Tottenham arm, it wouldn’t have been a penalty, so I don’t understand it. I don’t understand it at all. It should be debated. “We knew it was being reviewed. Every goal is reviewed. When the referee did the disallowed goal sign, I didn’t know why, Tottenham didn’t know why,” De Bruyne said.
