Big Brother Naija, BBNaija 2019 housemate, Khafi, on Friday night said she would like to be evicted on Sunday because she is tired of the house. Khafi, who is up for eviction this week, was upset after a rift with Jackie. It all started when Biggie gifted the housemates alcohol after the Friday night arena game. But when it arrived, Jackie argued that the drinks were for the cruisetopia team. The statement, which did not go well with the ‘Icons’, led to disagreement. Khafi speaking to Cindy, said, “really I will be happy to go home on Sunday. I’m so over all these. I’m tired.” Cindy, however, advised her not to make such statements. Meanwhile, DAILY POST had reported that UK police on Tuesday said Khafi who is a Metropolitan Police officer, went into the Big Brother Naija show despite being refused permission by her bosses. According to The Sun, Scotland Yard said it had not granted her request to appear on the programme and that an internal investigation would be carried out.
