The Enugu State Police Command on Thursday re-arrested Gideon Balogun, a prisoner that escaped from the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCS) in Enugu, in 2017. The command’s Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Ebere Amaraizu, in a statement on Thursday, said Balogun, who hailed from Edo State, was re-arrested on August 21 in Emene, an outskirt of Enugu metropolis. He revealed that the suspect, a former inmate of Enugu Prison, had been on the wanted list of the NCS in Enugu State. “Police operatives of Emene Division in the early hours of Wednesday re-arrested the wanted suspect while attempting to steal shafts from a mechanic workshop located in Emene, along Enugu-Abakiliki Road,” the police spokesman said. Amaraizu added that the state Commissioner of Police, Mr Suleiman Balarabe has directed for full-scale investigations into the alleged nefarious activities of the suspect and to arraign him in court.
