Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has played down expectations they could still sign Paul Pogba or Neymar this summer. Speaking at a press conference today ahead of their LaLiga opener against Celta Vigo, Zidane insisted he is “happy” with the players at his disposal. Although Madrid have spent over €300million on new signings, the Bernabeu hierarchy were unable to meet Zidane’s request to bring Pogba from Manchester United, while a late move for Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar has not progressed. However, Zidane was in a relaxed mood, when asked about transfer matters. “Paul is a Manchester [United] player and we must respect that. “Neymar is not a Real Madrid player. “The important thing is the players who are here. I will settle with what I have. I have spoken with the person who has to do things. “I have the best players here, no doubt – I always say that. I am happy with them, thinking just about tomorrow’s game,” Zidane said. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
