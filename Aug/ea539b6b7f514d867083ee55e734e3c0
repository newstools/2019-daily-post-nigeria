Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has confirmed that Defender Diogo Dalot will miss the Red Devils’ Premier League clash against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford on Saturday. According to him, Dalot is currently injured and will be back in action for Man United after the international break next month. Dalot will now join fellow defenders, Eric Bailly and Tim Fosu-Mensah, on the sideline. “Diogo is injured, he’ll be out for a little while, hopefully, he’ll be back for [the games] after the international break,” Solskjaer told MUTV. ”He’s had that problem for a couple of weeks. But that’s it. [The squad is] more or less the same.” Solskjaer’s men head to the game after their 1-1 draw with Wolves last Monday.
