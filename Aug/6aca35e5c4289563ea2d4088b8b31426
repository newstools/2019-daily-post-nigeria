Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola is reportedly unhappy with his injured forward, Leroy Sane, according to The Mirror. The Spaniard is angry because of the German’s decision to snub the club’s medical advice. Sane injured his anterior cruciate ligament in City’s Community Shield win over Liverpool two Sundays ago. Guardiola wanted the 23-year-old to undergo surgery with trusted doctor, Ramon Cugat, who has operated on Benjamin Mendy and Kevin De Bruyne in the past. However, the newspaper claimed that the Spaniard has been ‘angered’ by Sane’s decision to choose Austrian specialist, Professor Christian Fink, to operate on him instead. Fink is the German FA’s go-to surgeon and Sane is determined to prove to national team boss, Joachim Low, that he will be fit in time for Euro 2020. The former Schalke star was controversially left out of Low’s 2018 World Cup squad as Germany were knocked out in the group stages. Sane has been ruled out until March, meaning that he will have two months of action.
