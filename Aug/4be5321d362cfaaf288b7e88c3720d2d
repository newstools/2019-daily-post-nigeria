Liverpool legend, Jamie Carragher has stated that Super Eagles midfielder, Alex Iwobi, will be a replacement for Brazilian winger, Bernard, in the Everton starting line-up. Carragher criticised Bernard for lacking physical attributes as well as falling short in terms of pace. Iwobi came into the Everton’s 2-0 eventual loss to Aston Villa on Friday to change the game. The Nigerian was unlucky not to score on his debut when he hit the woodwork with a left-footed strike. ”In Bernard when I watch him play he’s not powerful enough or quick enough. He’s neat and tidy at different times, you think Iwobi will come in there [to replace him],” Carragher told Sky Sports. ”Hopefully for them Iwobi comes in on that side and adds more goals than Bernard does.” The Nigerian international was directly involved in 15 goals (6 goals, 9 assists) for Arsenal last season before joining Everton in the summer. Bernard, on the other hand, had a hand in only six goals (2 goals, 4 assists) for the Everton in all competitions.
