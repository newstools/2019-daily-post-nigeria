Leader of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria, IMN, Sheikh Ibrahim El-ZakZaky and his wife, Zeenat, have arrived Nigeria, after their failed medical trip to India. El-Zakzaky and his wife arrived the country aboard an Ethiopian Airlines by exactly 12 noon at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport and are being held by operatives of the Department of State Services, DSS. Recall that the IMN leader had complained about President Muhammadu Buhari government’s handling of his treatment in India. He had refused treatment from those he called “unknown doctors” put in place to treat him. The Shiites leader insisted he wanted to be treated by those booked to treat him before he and his wife left Nigeria.
