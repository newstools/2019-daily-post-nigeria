A fan had asked why he had sex with Khafi. Gedoni, however, said, “Myself and Khafi never had sex. “I want to say this, When I got out I only wanted to talk about my work and career and ways to push my brand forward. This competition thought me to be very competitive and I want to put that “ginger” in my life and businesses. But instead, am faced with this questions about Khafi. “And this is needed to be cleared. Many misunderstandings, misinterpretations, to the point of publications coming from the Uk and all, all types of meme and all, it’s a price to pay for Fame yes, but WE especially Khafi doesn’t deserve this. “Am not saying this to Capture any type of relevance, but doing this all for Khafi, because she will do the same and even more. MYSELF AND Khafi NEVER HAD SEX, Take away the hate and give love a chance. If this can’t convince any of you then am done here GOD BLESS YOU ALL #BBNAIJA”.
