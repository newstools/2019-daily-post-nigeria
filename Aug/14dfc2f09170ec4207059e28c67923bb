Manchester United have confirmed that midfielder, Ethan Hamilton, left the club on Friday to join Southend United on a season-long loan. The Red Devils made this known in a statement on the club’s official website on Friday. The statement reads: “Manchester United prospect Ethan Hamilton has joined Southend United on loan for the 2019/20 season. “The 20-year-old midfielder will hope to gain further first-team experience under manager Kevin Bond at Roots Hall, after impressing on loan at another League One club, Rochdale, last season. “The Academy product enjoyed a successful stint with The Dale in the second half of last term, scoring four goals in fourteen appearances. “Hamilton is the sixth player to make a temporary move away from United during the window, which closes on 2 September for League One and League Two clubs. The process enables our young players to benefit from facing senior opposition on a regular basis. “Good luck to Ethan for his loan spell at Southend.” Man United will take on Wolves on Monday in their next Premier League fixture.
