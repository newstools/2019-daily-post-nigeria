Liverpool legend, Graeme Souness has attacked the club’s midfielder, Fabinho for his performance during their Super Cup shootouts win over Chelsea on Wednesday. Liverpool beat Chelsea on penalties to lift the European trophy for the fourth time in Istanbul after the match finished 2-2 in extra time. Liverpool were far from their best against Frank Lampard’s side and had to come from behind after Olivier Giroud gave the Blues a first-half lead. Jurgen Klopp’s midfield was particularly vulnerable for much of the game as they struggled to deal with an impressive display from N’Golo Kante. And Souness, a Newcastle United boss, noted that the Reds looked very different from the team that won last year’s Champions League. He blamed Fabinho’s inability to deal with the Chelsea midfielder. He told Virgin Media Sport Ireland, “This guy [Fabinho], twice he had Kante dance past him as if he had Jacques Cousteau boots, lead boots on. “They were not Liverpool. I’m not seeing a Liverpool that resembles the Liverpool we saw last season. “I’m amazed Liverpool were more tired than Chelsea – they’ve had two extra days to rest. “I was disappointed with Liverpool. I expected them to be lively, energetic and win comfortably, even by two or three goals. “I really thought they were second best for the largest part. I thought Chelsea played better football and had more energy. “Given Chelsea played Sunday and Liverpool played Friday that should not have been the case.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
