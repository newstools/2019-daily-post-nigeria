The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr Uche Secondus, has called on members of the party in Lagos to amend their differences and make peace. NAN reports that Secondus, made the call on Tuesday in Abuja while receiving report from a three-man ad hoc committee set up by the National Working Committee (NWC) on the resolution of the crisis in the Lagos State chapter, led by Sen. Ben Obi. Secondus said that Lagos was “winnable” for PDP if members could allow peace to reign.
“All we want is peace, all we want is to win Lagos. “And for our members in Lagos, the bible says there is time for everything. ”We have had enough crisis, the time has come for peace. We need everybody to make the difference,” he said. Secondus assured the members that PDP leadership would look into the complaints of lopsidedness in the membership of the Board of Trustees from Lagos. He also assured them that the NWC would not interfer in the running of the state chapter. “Lagos will govern and administer themselves for us to win Lagos. There will be no interference,” he said. Secondus commended the committee for its recommendations and for setting the stage for final peace and reconciliation in Lagos.
