The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has denied that Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Abba Kyari, ordered the probe of Head of Civil Service of the Federation, Mrs. Winifred Oyo-Ita. The anti-graft agency made this know in a statement signed by its spokesperson, Wilson Uwujaren, on Monday. Uwujaren insisted that the investigation was based on evidence and not on political considerations. The statement reads in part, “The attention of the EFCC has been drawn to reports by a section of the media insinuating that the ongoing investigation of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Mrs. Winifred Oyo-Ita, by the Commission was instigated by the Chief of Staff to the President. “The Commission wishes to state that there is no truth in these claims, and urges the general public to disregard the reports as the handiwork of mischief makers. “For the avoidance of doubt, investigation by the EFCC is evidence-based. Most often, they are triggered by petitions or intelligence. “In the case of the HoS Oyo-Ita’s investigation, it was prompted by intelligence received by the Commission.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
