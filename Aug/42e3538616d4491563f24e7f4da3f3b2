Former Super Eagles captain, Joseph Yobo, has commented on Alex Iwobi’s move from Arsenal to Everton. DAILY POST had reported that Iwobi agreed a five-year contract with Everton, in a deal worth £40million last Thursday. Yobo, a former Everton defender, commended Iwobi for joining Marco Silva’s men. “I must commend Alex Iwobi for making that bold move. Everton is a quality team and I’m happy as an Evertonian that we acquired a talent like him,” Yobo told Goal. “I think the main reason behind this is his playing time and I’m sure he will get that but he has to work harder than what he does in Arsenal. “Apart from that, he’s got everything to succeed and I’m not surprised that huge bid was made for him. “In my own opinion, it’s a good move because staying with Arsenal who brought in [Nicolas] Pepe will reduce his playing time. Here, he will learn more which will make him grow and more matured in the game.” Yobo added: “If you want to put that into context, Nigeria does not play like Arsenal yet he plays very well and that’s why I say the Super Eagles will benefit from this move because we’ll see a better Iwobi. “Nigeria will benefit more because we will see a more tactically disciplined and physically fit Iwobi because his talent has always been there. And that will make him a more complete player. “Although I agree that these teams play a different kind of football, I believe Everton is more structured. Arsenal is a good footballing side and play free-flowing football but football doesn’t work that way. “They have not been disciplined defensively in the past few years and that’s why they haven’t really won anything. “Everton are a growing club, just a little bit behind the top four. We can only wish him good luck and hope he gets the goals which will give him more confidence.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
