Manchester United midfielder, Nemanja Matic, demanded showdown talks with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, after losing his first-team place at Old Trafford, the UK Sun reports. The 31-year-old has been ousted from his central midfield role by youngster Scott McTominay and has not played a minute of United’s opening three matches. Solskjaer has left the Serbian on the bench for each fixture, with Matic now keen to get some clarity on his future at the club. That has been all the more concerning for Matic, following the departures of fellow central midfielders Marouane Fellaini and Ander Herrera. Matic was a firm favourite under former boss, Jose Mourinho, who signed him from Chelsea for £40million in 2017. But Solskjaer has not started him in competitive action, since United’s defeat to Huddersfield at the first week of May. With United’s focus clearly now on young, hungry players, Matic fears his advancing years are pushing him further towards the Old Trafford exit door.
