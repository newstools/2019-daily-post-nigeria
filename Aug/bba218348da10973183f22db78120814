Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate Mercy on Tuesday accused Omashola of brainwashing her ‘lover’ Ike. DAILY POST recalls that Omashola, Cindy, Esther, Sir Dee, Tacha and Frodd were on Monday put up for possible eviction next week. However, Ike, who has the Veto power saved Omashola and replaced him with Cindy. Mercy, speaking to Diane on Tuesday, claimed Omashola brainwashed Ike into saving him before the nomination challenge. She explained that Omashola, knowing that Ike had the veto power to save anyone had called him to the garden some minutes before the challenge; dishing advice to him. According to Mercy, this act from Omashola won Ike’s heart and that was the reason he saved him. Mercy added that she was surprised at Ike’s decision because she thought he was going to save Tacha, not Omashola. “I was shocked when Ike called out Omashola to save him, I thought he was going to save Tacha. “Omashola brainwashed Ike into saving him with his Veto-power when he took him aside to advise him not to challenge Khafi’s HoH title.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
