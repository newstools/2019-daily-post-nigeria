Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemates, Tacha and Joe have been issued strikes by Big Brother. Both housemates were issued strikes on Monday night as Biggie played a clip from last week. Tacha in the video got infuriated by Joe and hit him. According to Biggie, this is against the rules of Big Brother. Also, Joe was found guilty of provocation as he made Tacha hit him. Biggie toJoe: “Big Brother finds you guilty of provocations and provoking another housemate.” To Tacha: “Big Brother finds you guilty of violence and this is not acceptable in the house, therefore, you have been issued a strike. “These are your first strikes, two more from you you will be disqualified from Big Brother house.” DAILY POST recalls that Tacha on Friday engaged in a heated argument with fellow housemate, Joe and rained insults on him.
