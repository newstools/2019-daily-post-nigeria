Big Brother on Saturday punished Tacha for refusing to wear sponsored outfits for the Saturday night party. Tacha’s disobedience had last week stirred reaction after she refused to wear the themed outfit Biggie gave housemate for the party despite warning. Biggie had warned housemates that if they fail to appreciate the cloths given to them, he would stop bringing it. But after the warning, Tacha was last week quoted as saying, ‘This is the third outfit they are bringing and I won’t wear what I don’t like.” However on Saturday when Biggie brought the ‘Ankara themed outfits for the housemates, DAILY POST noticed that Tacha was not given. The sponsors of the Ankara outfit while confirming the development on Instagram revealed why Tacha was not gifted. A fan had asked if they forgot Tacha’s outfit but the sponsors said, ‘No we did not, order for above.” BBNaija fans also commended Biggie for Tacha’s punishment. Meanwhile, Tacha, Ike, Frodd, Omashola, Khafi , Elozonam, Enkay, Cindy, and Joe are up for eviction this week.
