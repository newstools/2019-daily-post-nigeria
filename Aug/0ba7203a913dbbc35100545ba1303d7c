The national leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu has revealed real reason behind attack on Ex-Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu and South East Governors. Kanu said IPOB members were against the Southeast governors because they proscribed the group. Kanu announced this during a live broadcast on the Radio Biafra, Sunday night. According to him, the Igbo leader’s proscribed IPOB as a terrorist group not the federal government. “They and not the Federal Government of Nigerian proscribed IPOB. “They said they proscribed IPOB to douse rising tension in the region. What caused the tension, because the military raided my house in Umuahia,” Kanu said. Further speaking on the attack on former Deputy Senate President Ike Ekeremadu, the IPOB leader added that the senator connived with the governors to proscribe his group, hence reason for his attack. “They also brought the Army to raid my House in Umuahia. How many times has he spoken against the killings and kidnappings happening in his own state? “He went to celebrate New Yam Festival in Germany when his people are being killed and our women being raped. Where did they get the new Yam because there is none in Igboland since all the farmlands have been destroyed by herdsmen”. The IPOB leader further commended the outspokenness of Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe and former Aviation Minister Femi Fani- Kayode. According to him both parties stood for IPOB and had maintained the truth concerning the Biafra group. “We campaigned for Abaribe’s re-election because he always spoke the truth everytime about what is happening in the country and today he is the highest political office holder in Igboland. “Fani Kayode is not an Igbo man but he always stands for the truth and so we have enormous respect for him,” Kanu added.
