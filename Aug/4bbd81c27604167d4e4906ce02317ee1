Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has insisted that he will not get caught up over the Red Devils’ missed penalties. Solskjaer said this while reacting to Striker Marcus Rashford’s penalty miss in Man United’s 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday at Old Trafford. Rashford missed from the spot against Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday. With Solskjaer’s men 1-0 down at Old Trafford, Rashford was presented with a perfect opportunity to level the scores. However, the England international wasted the big chance as he struck the inside of the post after Scott McTominay was brought down in the box. Solskjaer had during the week stopped Midfielder, Paul Pogba from taking spot-kick for Man United making it a sole responsibility of Rashford. “Two games, two missed penalties. It’s part and parcel of it,” Solskjaer was quoted by Mirror UK as saying after the match “Sometimes it happens. I have missed a few myself. If we score them it’s a different story. “If we keep putting ourselves in those positions we will get more penalties and we will score. “It is just one of those things. We trust them to score again.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
