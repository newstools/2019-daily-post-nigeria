The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 elections, Atiku Abubakar, has praised the virtues of former military Head of State, General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida. Atiku, in a special congratulatory birthday message, highlighted the nation-building roles played by IBB, who turned 78 on August 17. In a statement signed by his Media Adviser, Paul Ibe, the former vice president said that in and out of office, IBB carried himself with immense grace and comportment. “General Babangida as a young officer fought for the unity and indivisibility of our fatherland. “And as head of state, he not only spearhead the physical relocation of the nation’s capital from Lagos to Abuja but politically too, championed and implemented the ideal of a two-party system which enlisted the majority of Nigerians. “In and out of office, General Babangida carries himself with immense grace, comportment and dignified charisma,” the statement read in part. Atiku further prayed for good health and long life for Babangida, in his continued service to the nation. “Our dear country, more than ever before, now needs the collective wisdom of her great leaders, to steer the ship of state away from its current path of abysmal wreck,” Atiku noted.
