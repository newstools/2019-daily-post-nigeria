Senator Shehu Sani, the former lawmaker representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District in the National Assembly, has reacted to the recent abduction of Law students by kidnappers on the Kaduna-Abuja expressway. DAILY POST had reported that three final-year law students of Ahmadu Bello University, ABU Zaria have been abducted. They were seized on the notorious Kaduna-Abuja expressway Tuesday afternoon. A source disclosed to PRNigeria that the names of the undergraduates are: Fatima from Taraba, Maryam from Niger and Umar from Katsina States respectively. The source said: “The three abducted students are all 500-Level law students of ABU Zaria. We learn that the kidnappers initially demanded for N50m ransom each but later reduced to N5m because they are students who are yet to be working.” A passenger, who escaped during the encounter with the kidnappers, told PRNigeria that the abductors attacked commercial vehicles and big trucks. “I am surprised that unlike their previous antics of attacking rich and big people in exotic cars, the kidnappers now attack commercial vehicles, trucks and buses and abducted their poor drivers and passengers. “I shed tears when I noticed corpses of some victims littered on the road after the brutal abduction incident. “Some top public functionaries with armed convoy who came later refused to stop when crying women sought for help and protection.” Reacting, Sani, in a tweet on Tuesday, called on security agencies to do everything possible to secure the student’s release. He said: “The Killings and Kidnapping of students and others along Kaduna Abuja road yesterday is tragic. “My thoughts and prayers for the victims and their families. I call on security agencies to double or triple efforts to secure their release.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
