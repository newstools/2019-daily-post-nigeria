Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp has revealed why the Reds bested Arsenal 3-1 in the Premier League on Saturday. It was another difficult afternoon for Arsenal at the hands of Liverpool. Unai Emery’s side has suffered in recent seasons against the Reds, and Saturday’s clash at Arsenal was no different with the home side running out as 3-1 winners. Mohamed Salah was the Liverpool hero in the second half, adding two goals to Joel Matip’s opener in the first half. Salah seems to have been given a helping hand by Arsenal defender, David Luiz, who tugged at the Egyptian’s shirt in the box thereby giving away a penalty that Salah converted. Lucas Torreira came off the bench for the Gunners to score the Arsenal goal. Klopp told a post-match press conference, “I saw a brilliant game from my team at this early in the season. It was outstanding. “A performance full of power, full of energy and full of passion. That’s what you need against such a good team.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
