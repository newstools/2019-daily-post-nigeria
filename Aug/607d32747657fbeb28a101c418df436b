Chuks Ibegbu, the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, has knocked Senator Shehu Sani for allegedly calling on the leadership of the All Progressives Congress(APC) to zone the 2023 Presidency to the South West, when the South East geo-political zone was yet to produce a Nigerian Executive President. Ibegbu who made Ohanaeze’s position known in an interview with journalists,Tuesday, in Umuahia, the Abia state capital said, “This type of Sani’s thinking is responsible for the current state of the nation. How can a Senator of that calibre who claim to be an Activist have this kind of warped political reasoning devoid of justice and equity? However, the Ohanaeze spokesman insisted that after the North(Buhari), it’s the turn of the South East to produce the next Nigeria President, calling on the people of south East to go into alliances in order to occupy the number one seat of the nation. He said this while paying Sallah homage to the first Executive Governor of old Kaduna State, Alhaji Balarabe Musa, on Monday. Asked to react to the insecurity in the land, Ibegbu berated the Nigeria Army , Police and other security agents over alleged impunity and bestiality which led to the Taraba shooting and killing of more than four hundred Shiites members in Zaria. He warned of the consequences of impunity at high and low places in Nigeria and called on the judiciary to discharge their duty by sending these killers to jail. “Unfortunately, our so called politicians care less over this killings and are only interested in their pockets and positions. Many hoodlums and killers were recruited into our security forces and we are paying for it now. I’m asking the politicians in Nigeria too to repent and see politics as a call to service”.
