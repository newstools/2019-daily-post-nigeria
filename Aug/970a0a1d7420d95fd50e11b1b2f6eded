He issued the warning while addressing an expanded PDP stakeholders’ meeting in Yenagoa. According to a statement on Tuesday by his Special Adviser on Media Relations, Fidelis Soriwei, the Governor stressed the need for the gladiators to pursue their political ambitions within the ambit of the law and rules of the game. Restating his zero tolerance for violence, Dickson noted that in spite of the pervasive insecurity in the country, Bayelsa had maintained its status as one of the most stable and peaceful states across the federation. He said he was passionate about handing over a peaceful and stable state to his successor. To this end, Dickson was quoted as saying “no efforts would be spared in keeping the state secure for business and other meaningful activities to sustain its stability and progress.” Commending the contenders for the maturity and brotherliness exhibited so far, the governor urged them to sustain the warm relationship for the benefit of the party and the state.
