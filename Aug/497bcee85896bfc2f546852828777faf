Paris Saint-Germain are open to the idea of a loan deal for Neymar with an obligation to buy, Goal reports. Neymar is yet to play for the Ligue 1 champions this season after indicating that he wants to leave. Barcelona and Real Madrid have so far failed to land the Brazilian, with PSG looking to recoup most of the €222million they paid for him two years ago. PSG have also rejected any prospective cash-plus-players deal. Now, however, with the European transfer deadline looming and the prospect of an expensive player refusing to take to the field for the first half of the season, sporting director, Leonardo Arajuo, and coach Thomas Tuchel are expected to hold sit-down talks with the player over his future. PSG are receptive to the idea of loaning the 27-year-old out with a subsequent obligation to buy, which would carry a price tag roughly in the region of €220m (£201m/$244m) to €250m (£228m/$277m).
