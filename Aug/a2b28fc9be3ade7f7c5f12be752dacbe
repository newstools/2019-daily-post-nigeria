Leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, IMN, Sheikh Ibrahim Elzakzaky and his wife have finally traveled out of Nigeria. They left Abuja to India for medical treatment at about 6:30 pm Nigerian time. DAILY POST obtained a photo of El-Zakzaky seated in an aircraft Monday night. He flew out in a commercial airliner, Emirates. The Shiites leader and Zeenat were moved from Kaduna to Abuja on Sunday. They had been in government detention since 2016. Apart from security personnel who accompanied the Sheikh, family members were also on the trip. It would be recalled that Kaduna State Government had released conditions that must be met before El-Zakzaky was allowed to leave Nigeria. Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, in a statement, said though the state government will appeal the ruling of the Kaduna High Court ruling allowing El Zakzaky to travel, it will not seek a stay of execution because it believes that people should have access to treatment. In reaction, legal luminary, Femi Falana, the Islamic Movement of Nigeria lead lawyer, criticised Kaduna government’s stringent conditions.
