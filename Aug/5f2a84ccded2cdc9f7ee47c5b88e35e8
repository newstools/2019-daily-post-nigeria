Real Madrid captain, Sergio Ramos, has said he understands the decision by the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), to show Luka Modric a red card in their win over Celta Vigo. Los Blancos ran out 3-1 winners at Balaidos, in their first La Liga game of the season on Saturday despite Modric’s dismissal. The Ballon d’Or winner was shown the red card for the first time in LaLiga, after catching Suarez early in the second half. Speaking to the media after the game, Ramos said: “Everything used to protect football is good. “Today the decision was against us. We ended up with one less man, I don’t think Modric went in with bad intention but he arrived late and the referee had doubts. “He spoke to the other officials and reached that decision. VAR’s there to help us and if these decisions protect football then they are welcome.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
