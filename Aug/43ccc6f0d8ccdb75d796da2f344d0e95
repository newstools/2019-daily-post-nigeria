This year’s UEFA Super Cup will be contested between Chelsea and Liverpool on Wednesday night. It is the first time it would be an all-English affair. The match will be played at the Beşiktaş Park in Istanbul. Liverpool, who qualified by claiming their sixth European Cup in Madrid in June, are making their sixth UEFA Super Cup appearance and are bidding to lift the trophy for the fourth time. This is Chelsea’s fourth UEFA Super Cup match; having won the first in 1998, they have lost on their last two appearances. Whoever wins in Istanbul will claim England’s eighth UEFA Super Cup, fewer only than Spain (15) and Italy (nine). Kick off is 8 pm West African time.
