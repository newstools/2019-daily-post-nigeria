Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has said he wants to see more from his players, after their 1-0 win at Newcastle got their Premier League campaign off to a winning start. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored the only goal at St James’ Park, as the Gunners picked up maximum points. But Emery has demanded an improved performance, when they host Burnley at the Emirates this Saturday. “We need to improve. We were happy with the three points and we played seriously, but I want to improve on each position for us. “We need to and can improve with the same players and other players who were out of that match. My idea is to be more competitive in each position. “We worked very well that match, above all defensively we worked very compact. The balance, we must improve,” Emery said at Thursday’s news conference. Arsenal have already matched their Premier League away clean sheet tally for the whole of last season, in the very first game this campaign. But Emery has urged a better attacking performance and said: “The build-up needs to be better. “We need better progress with our combinations and need to be safer each moment when we pass the ball between us. “When we progress with the ball like a team we can find better positions and solutions in the attacking third. “The clean sheet is important but the most important thing is to win. If we can win scoring a lot of goals, good. If we can have a clean sheet each match, it’s perfect.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
