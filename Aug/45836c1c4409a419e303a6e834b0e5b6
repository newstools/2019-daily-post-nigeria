Philippe Coutinho’s agent, Kia Joorabchian, has arrived in Paris, to try and negotiate a deal for the player at Paris Saint-Germain, according to Sport. Barcelona are ready to sacrifice Coutinho, in order to secure the return of Neymar Jr. The Spanish champions’ Director of Football, Eric Abidal, board member Javier Bordas and Neymar’s intermediary Andre Cury, are also in the French capital to get the deal over the line. If Coutinho was to turn down a move to PSG, Barca would offer either Nelson Semedo and Ivan Rakitic to accelerate the transfer. Although Real Madrid are also interested in Neymar, the player would prefer to link up again with Lionel Messi and co at the Camp Nou.
