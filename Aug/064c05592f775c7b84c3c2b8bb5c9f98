The Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, on Thursday, said he chose his new cabinet after he sought the help of God. He said this while charging members of the State Executive Council to put the interest of the state before any other consideration in the course of their official duties. Ortom gave the charge on Thursday at the Benue Peoples House, Makurdi, during the first State Executive Council meeting in his second term. The Governor stated that his administration was anchored on the fear of God and the only thing for those in position of authority was to do the right thing and follow due process. He warned that he would not accept illegality under whatever guise. Ortom said all the cabinet members were chosen after he sought the help of God and urged them to selflessly serve the state. The Governor charged the Council members to trust in God and complement one another, encouraging them to freely contribute during meetings. He reminded them that expectations from the people were high and only top level performance from his appointees would be good enough. The Governor charged the cabinet members to avoid anything that would jeopardize their careers as they have the potential to serve in higher capacities in future.
