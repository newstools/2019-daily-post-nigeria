Alex Iwobi has opened Everton goal account for the Toffeemen as they came from behind to beat Lincoln FC 4-2 in the second round of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night. Iwobi, who moved from Arsenal to the Merseyside Blues in the summer, was handed his first start by Marco Silva on Wednesday night. The midfielder had missed Everton first two league games of the season but came on in the team’s 2-0 loss to Aston Villa last weekend. After impressing against Aston Villa, Silva decided to hand him his full debut and he did not disappoint. Lincoln took the lead in the opening 20 seconds through Harry Anderson, but Everton responded through a sublime freekick from Lucas Digne, before Gylfi Sigurdsson put the Toffees ahead 15 minutes after the break. But Lincoln restored parity through Bruno Andrade’s volley. However, Alex Iwobi will break their resilience as he scored the winner, heading home from close range. Richarlison settled any kind of nerves by heading home minutes after Iwobi’s goal. Speaking after the match, the Nigeria international revealed it was a tough match but they were prepared. He also added he’s enjoying time at his new club. “It was a difficult game. Credit to Lincoln. The important thing is we’re through. We showed our fighting spirit. I’m enjoying this new chapter of my life. Every competition we take seriously.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
