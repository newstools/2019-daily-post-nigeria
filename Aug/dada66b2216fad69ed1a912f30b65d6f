Former Liverpool star, Michael Owen has hailed Super Eagles midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi’s performance in Leicester City’s 1-1 draw with Chelsea on Sunday. Ndidi also got praise from former Arsenal player, Ian Wright and his teammate, James Maddison Ndidi was at fault for Chelsea’s goal scored by Mason Mount when he slipped, letting the young England star fire past Kasper Schmeichel. However, the Super Eagles star grabbed the Foxes’ equaliser with a fine header from a corner kick. Leicester attacking midfielder, Maddison told Sky Sports, “It shows the character of Ndidi (to put in such performance after his error). He put that quickly behind him and put in a good display. “We lost Harry Maguire and we needed a real big threat from set pieces because he (Maguire) was a large part of what we worked on last year and if you look around we actually haven’t got that much presence in the team. “Look at how high Wilfred jumped. To leap above Zouma was not an easy task,” Maddison stressed. Michael Owen added, “I feel for him (Ndidi). If I missed a sitter and my team plays a goalless draw that is how I will feel (in reference to Ndidi ruing his error leading to Chelsea’s goal). “I mean no question, it stays at the back of your mind but his header was just perfect,” said Owen. Wright on his part, described the Ndidi headed goal as “a majestic ball.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
