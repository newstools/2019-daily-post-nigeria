Former Manchester United striker, Robin van Persie, has claimed that Alexis Sanchez is not recreating his best form at the club, because he is not happy. While Van Persie’s move from Arsenal to United in 2012 proved to be a huge success, the same cannot be said of Sanchez after he made the same transfer in January 2018. Sanchez has scored just three Premier League goals for United and has been linked with a move away from the club. But Van Persie believes he could bounce back this season. “He is still a wonderful player, still a great player. “He needs to find a way to be happy again. “If you are happy, you want to create and have fun. He had that in his first couple of months from what I saw and he needs to find that again. “He can still play, he is still a fantastic football player. He just doesn’t really look happy and the reason why this is… I don’t know. I can only guess, but from distance, he looks unhappy and he needs to find a way to be happy again,” Van Persie told BT Sport.
