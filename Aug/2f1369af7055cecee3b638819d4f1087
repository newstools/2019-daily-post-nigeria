A Magistrates’ Court in Makurdi on Friday ordered that a farmer, Iorpenda Gbashinbo, who allegedly stabbed an old man to death, be remanded in prison custody, pending legal advice. Magistrate Ajuma Igama did not take the plea of Gbashinbo for want of jurisdiction. According to the News Agency of Nigeria, Igama ordered the police to return the case file to the office of the Benue Director of Public Prosecutions for legal advice. She adjourned the case until Sept 4. The Prosecution Counsel, Sgt. Ato Godwin, told the court that the case was reported at Daudu police station by Verior Ortar, who lives in Gbashinbo village Guma L.G.A Benue on July 20. Godwin also told the court that the Gbashinbo, with others who are at large, attacked the complainant’s father, Ortar Kpehe, at his family house in Daudu town. He said that they injured the victim with a knife and he later died in a hospital from his injuries. Godwin said investigation into the matter was ongoing and begged the court for another date for mention, adding that the offence contravened the provisions of section 97 and 222 of the penal code laws of Benue State 2004.
