There is serious tension in Udu as gunmen reportedly shot dead a suspected internet fraudster popularly known as “Yahoo boy” simply identified as Obus, for swindling them at Igbiki layout close in Udu Local Government Area of Delta State. DAILY POST gathered that the deceased and his girl friend had just returned from an outing when the gunmen struck. The gunmen seized the deceased’s girlfriend and ordered her to take them (gunmen) to his room where they shot him dead. The gunmen left the scene of incident without hurting any other person in the area. DAILY POST gathered that the deceased and the gunmen had a deal and made unspecified amount of money. However, the deceased decided to play the “sharp man’s” game as he carted away the money from gunmen who were members of his internet fraud syndicate. When contacted for comments, the Delta State Commissioner of Police, CP Adeyinka Adeleke, confirmed the report in a telephone chat with our correspondent, saying, “It is true.” He, however, failed to give further details on the incident.
