Neymar’s wish to return to Barcelona looks to have been granted, after one of his sponsors, put a photo of him on social media in the Catalan side’s new shirt. According to Sportsmail, the post which was uploaded to Instagram by watchmaker Gaga Milano who boast Neymar as a brand ambassador, was deleted minutes after going live. It appears to all but confirm an agreement has been reached for him to leave Paris Saint-Germain. Neymar left Barcelona for £198million in 2017, but has grown unhappy in Paris in recent months and has made no secret of his desire to return to LaLiga. While the move is seemingly close to completion, Barcelona manager, Ernesto Valverde, admits he will be glad to see the transfer window close on September 2.
