Nigerian starlet, Dillon Hoogewerf, was included in Manchester United’s matchday squad, for a Premier League 2 fixture for the first time on Friday. United were held to a 2-2 draw by West Ham United in the game. Hoogewerf, who arrived from Ajax Amsterdam in the summer, however only made the bench. He was an unused substitute along with West Ham duo Daniel Jinadu and Tunji Akinola, while England U-19 invitee Ajibola Alese played the full game for the visitors at Old Trafford. Hoogewerf has enjoyed regular playing time with United’s U-18 squad, starting their last two games against Blackburn and Wolves and came off the bench on his debut against Sunderland.
