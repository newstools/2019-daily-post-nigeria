Chuks Ibegbu, the deputy National Publicity Secretary of the apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has criticized the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) and other anti-graft agencies in the country. Ibegbu attacked for what he called their slow pace of fighting corruption which had enabled corrupt persons contest elections and climb to the National Assembly. Ibegbu also stated that most of the corrupt persons facing criminal charges in court were equally allowed to emerge Governors and Ministers in the present democratic dispensation. The Ohanaeze chieftain, who made their position known in a statement issued to newsmen, and made available to DAILY POST on Saturday said, “Many Nigerians have lost fate in both institutions after seeing those that looted their commonwealth now in the National Assembly and other political offices. “The anti-corruption agencies (EFCC/ICPC) make a lot of noise of arresting and questioning corrupt politicians, after that, nothing happens. These looters go on enjoying their loots and even receiving more money from the tax payers in their new positions. Do you know that the crime and other mess we find ourselves in Nigeria is caused by corruption? “Corruption makes our youths unemployed and the masses suffer, hence going into all sorts of crime. Nigerian politicians have stolen more than Ninety percent of our commonwealth and stashed most of them in Europe and Asia. “Even many politicians surrounding President Buhari are corrupt. Yet, he appointed some of them as Ministers. You saw what they did during the National Assembly elections. A lot of deals took place, and yet, they said they are fighting corruption. You saw what happened in the Pensions fund and NHIS , how looters were given official soft landing. How can we fight corruption with such double deal?” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
