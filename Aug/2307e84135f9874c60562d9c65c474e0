Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has hinted he is ready to start Nicolas Pepe, Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang together for the first time, when they host Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. Aubameyang and Lacazette have already scored this season, while Pepe was a near menace in their 3-1 defeat to Liverpool last week. With the Gunners looking to bounce back from that loss against their North London rivals, Emery is looking to go for the kill. “Yes [they could all start], but be calm. “My decision in each moment is thinking about how we are. “For example with Lacazette he had a problem with his ankle. This week is the best week of the last three weeks. He’s getting better and feeling better with his ankle, it’s very positive. “With Pepe, he came here later than the others but he is getting and feeling better in each match. Aubameyang is very important for us, he scores two goals in the first two matches, he had two or three good actions in Liverpool,” Emery told the media on Thursday.
