Barcelona are confident of completing a deal to sign Neymar, following face-to-face talks with Paris Saint-Germain in Paris on Tuesday afternoon, Goal reports. A delegation that included CEO Oscar Grau, travelled to France with an offer of €160million (£144m/$177m) plus bonuses for the Brazilian. The money will reportedly be paid in three installments, in order to keep in line with Financial Fair Play (FFP). PSG are however asking for €100m (£90m/$111m) plus full-back Nelson Semedo. “We don’t have an agreement yet,” Barca executive Javier Bordas told the press upon returning to Catalunya on Tuesday. “We are still talking but we are closer.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
