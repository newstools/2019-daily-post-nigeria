The Benue State Executive Council met with stakeholders drawn from the traditional institution, the church, socio-cultural organisations, the academia, civil society and Miyetti Allah associations over the National Livestock Transformation Plan, NLTP. The meeting was to deliberate on the Federal Government proposed NLTP in order to take a position on implementation of the programme because it was earlier rejected due to lack of adequate information. A statement by the state’s Commissioner of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Timothy A Ijir and sent to DAILY POST, said the stakeholders went through the complete document which was recently made available to them. The meeting was the second of its kind and was facilitated by Nyager, who represented the state Executive Council. After exhaustive deliberations, stakeholders resolved to reconsider their position in view of the fact that they now have enough information to make an informed decision. It was also resolved during the meeting that a technical team of experts is put together to study the NLTP document and identify areas suitable for implementation in Benue State based on peculiarities of the state. The meeting also resolved that the NLTP should be domesticated in Benue State and to ensure that it conforms with the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law of the state. During the meeting, the State Executive Council stated that it is evolving its Agricultural Development Policy which captures the people’s interest.
