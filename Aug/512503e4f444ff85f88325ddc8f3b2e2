Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Mr Muhammad Babandede, Tuesday advised Nigerians to desist from patronising fake recruitment sites as the Service was not recruiting. The spokesman of NIS, Mr Sunday James, in a statement on Tuesday, said that Babandede gave the warning due to the increasing activities of fraudsters across the country. “This notice became necessary due to the increasing activities of fraudsters that have remained unrepentant. “After several arrests and arraignment they continue to open fake recruitment sites through which they defraud unsuspecting citizens of their money. “The fake recruitment sites created by the fraudsters include https://www.recruitment.com.ng ,hotnigerianjobs/military/nigeria-immigration-recruitment-portal-www-immigration-gov-ng.” NAN quoted him as saying. He added that the NIS, apart from publishing its official recruitment in reputable newspapers, would not charge any fee for it.
