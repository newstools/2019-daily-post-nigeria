The ‘Icon’ team of the ongoing Big Brother Naija, BBNaija ‘Pepper Dem’ edition on Thursday won the week’s wager task. DAILY POST recalls that Big Brother had divided the housemates into two teams; The Icons and Cruisetopia. The Icons include: Cindy, Elozonam, Enkay, Frodd, Ike, Khafi, Omashola, Sir Dee and Tacha while the Cruisetopia has: Diane, Esther, Gedoni, Jackye, Joe, Mercy, Mike, Seyi, and Venita as members. Biggie had asked the housemates to come up with creative arts in any form to perform a talent show as part of the Wager task. The housemates were not given props by Biggie for this task unlike others, but were instructed to use available materials in the house. The icons pulled up a great performance and worked collectively which earned them 16 points ahead of the Cruisetopia team The Icons started their performance with an acrobatic display. Then Sir Dee, Elozonam, Frodd and Ike impressed fans with their chest-puffing and humming.  Afterwards, Elozonam performed flexible dance moves amid a little dramatic performance. On the other hand, Cruisetopia started their performance with a national anthem as Seyi presented their acts. Joe at the end of the performance unveiled a beautifully-drawn coat of arms. Despite the argument between Seyi and Mike earlier, the Cruisetopia still did their best as they earned 11 points. Despite losing, the Cruisetopia team were commended by Biggie for their performance. The winning team gets food and provision while the losing team will be denied of provisions for a week. In addition to the provisions, each member of The Icons was rewarded with 20 coins.
