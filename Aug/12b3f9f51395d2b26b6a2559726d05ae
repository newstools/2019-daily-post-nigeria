Former Big Brother Africa winner, Uti Nwachukwu, on Monday said BBNaija 2019 housemate, Mercy, would emerge as winner of the reality show. Uti was reacting to Mercy’s vote percentage in this week’s eviction show. DAILY POST had reported that Gedoni and Jackye were evicted on Sunday during the Live eviction show. They were evicted after they emerged as housemates with the least votes. DAILY POST also recalls that Mercy had the highest vote of 25.55 percent. However, reacting via his Twitter handle, Uti congratulated Mercy in advance. He wrote, ”Omooo! No contest! #Mercy is DEFINITELY winning this years #BBNaija. congratulations in Advance!! The rest peeps and their fans can fight for 2nd to 5th position.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
