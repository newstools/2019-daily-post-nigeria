Barcelona defender, Gerard Pique has revealed he has spoken to Neymar about a potential return. Neymar is desperate to force a move away from Paris Saint-Germain, before the European transfer window closes next week. Barca are keen to tie up the transfer and have sent officials to the French capital, in order to try and complete the deal before September 2. When asked about Neymar, Pique told the Daily Express: “We have spoken yeah. But obviously it is a private conversation. “I don’t know. It is pretty difficult to know. I know that the club are working very hard to get him. It is not easy, he is not a player of Barcelona right now. “I can just say let’s see what happens in the next week. Let’s see if he comes back.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
