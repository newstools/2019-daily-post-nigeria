The Presidency, on Monday reacted to reports that the Head of Service of the federation, Winifred Oyo-Ita, has forwarded her letter of retirement to President Muhammadu Buhari. Reports had on Monday morning emerged that Oyo-Ita sent in her retirement letter following pressure from her immediate family to retire over alleged N3 billion contract scam. The report had said Oyo-Ita bowed to family pressures and sent in a letter on Sunday, offering to proceed on retirement despite her consistent denial of involvement in any scam. But, reacting, the Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, said that the presidency did not receive any letter of intent from Oyo-Ita to retire from service. “Thanks. We have no such letter here, in the event that such a letter exists. This is our position,” he told the Nation. This is coming after EFCC quizzed Oyo-Ita over alleged N3billion contract scam. She faced a four-day grilling during which she was in custody of the anti-graft agency beginning from August 8. Mrs Oyo-Ita has now landed in the hospital after being granted administrative bail.
