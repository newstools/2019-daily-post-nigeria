Seven Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemates, have been selected for possible eviction this week. The housemates were nominated after an arena game challenge between two groups, the Icons and Cruistopia. They were told to fill up their team’s cup with a spoon. The team that filled the cup on time emerged winner. DAILY POST recalls that Big brother divided the housemates into two groups sometime lastweek. The ‘Cruistopia team’ were defeated during the challenge. Elozonam, who won the veto power on Sunday was asked to save one housemate. He, however, saved Venita and replaced him with Frodd from her team, ‘Cruistopia’. Here are the housemates up for eviction: Gedoni, Mike, Frodd, Diane, Jackie, Seyi, Mercy. They are all members of the Cruisetopia. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
