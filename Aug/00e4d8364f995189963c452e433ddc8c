Manchester United have promised Ole Gunnar Solskjaer the full £75million the club got from Romelu Lukaku’s sale to Inter Milan, for transfers in January, the UK Sun reports. Lukaku completed his move to Italy on deadline day, in a deal which was the second-largest United have ever received for a player. The highest remains the £84m they got from Real Madrid for Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009. United spent close to £150m this summer on Daniel James from Swansea, Aaron Wan-Bissaka from Crystal Palace and Harry Maguire from Leicester. As well as selling Lukaku, they also released Antonio Valencia and Ander Herrera, freeing up some funds to go on wages. Most of those monies will be handed to Solskjaer, to make at least one or two signings in January, when the winter transfer window opens.
