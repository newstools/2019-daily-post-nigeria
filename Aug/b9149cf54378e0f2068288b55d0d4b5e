The All Progressives Congress (APC) has insisted that it could never have allocated resources to a kidnapper or murderer. The ruling party stated this in reaction to a claim made by Hamisu Bala, a suspected kidnap kingpin popularly known as Wadume. He had alleged that the APC gave him N13million ahead of the February 23 presidential election. He also claimed that the Governor of Taraba state, Darius Ishaku, gave him N6million for the elections. But in a statement on Saturday, APC spokesman, Lanre Issa-Onilu said his party did not have a budget for thugs in the last general election. “It is expected that the alleged kidnapper, having come face to face with justice, would throw whatever he could lay his hands on into the fray. “In any case, our party did not have budget for thugs. Unlike the period when the ruling party dipped hands into the public treasury to fund political campaigns and elections, APC had to rely on its own resources. Even if we had all the money, we would never allocate money for kidnappers and murderers. That era ended with PDP. “Perhaps, he can name whoever gave him money. Definitely, it was not APC. From his purported confession, he claimed to be a PDP member before he went on to contest under another party,” Issa-Onilu said.
