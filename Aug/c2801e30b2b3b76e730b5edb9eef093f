Some aggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Ikpoba-Okha have passed vote of no confidence on the Secretary to Edo State government, Osarodion Ogie, alleging anti-party activities. Pressure group, ‘APC Libration Movement’ made this known at a Stakeholders meeting recently in Benin city, the state capital. According to the spokesperson of the group, Mr Aiyamekhue Edokpolo, those dealing with him on behalf of Okpoba-Okha Local Government Area of the State APC Chapter are doing so in their interests.” He cited lack of state government present in the area where the SSG hails from. Edokpolor noted that the present political quandary in the state is lack of pragmatic and sincere leadership who are claiming to be party men. “We are aware that the so-called leader is trying hard to secure the trust of APC National Working Committee in order to be considered for the 2020 gubernatorial ticket having been allegedly deprived of it in 2016,” he said. He declared that the political tension in Edo State arising from alleged tumult between Governor Godwin Obaseki and Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, has continue to take a devastating blow on party members because of parry men like the SSG. “These are among other reasons we resolved to pass a vote of no confidence on him. So we have found hope and confidence in the person of Mr Osarobo Idahosa,” he concluded. Reacting to the issue, Osarodion Ogie told DAILY POST that he is not aware of the gathering, saying that its secretary or chairman at the exco level that have such power not ordinary club members.
