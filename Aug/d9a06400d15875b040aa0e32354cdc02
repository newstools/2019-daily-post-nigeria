The former governor of Ekiti State, Mr Ayodele Fayose, Friday staged a surprise visit to the Ekiti State House of Assembly in less than 24 hours after the lawmakers summoned him to appear over alleged fraud. Fayose said that he came to Ekiti House of Assembly to tell them “I am here and if they need any clarification I can answer because clear conscience fear no foe.” The Assembly had at its Thursday plenary session summoned Fayose to appear before its committee on Public Account over alleged misappropriation of local government funds while in office. Also summoned alongside the former governor were the former chairman of the Association of Local Government chairmen ALGON, Mr. Dapo Olagunju, the former Commissioner for Local Government Affairs, Mr. Kola Kolade and all the former 16 local government chairmen. The Assembly said that its decision followed the adoption of the recommendations of the joint Committee of the House on Public Petition and Local Governments that were recently directed to look into a Petition submitted to the Assembly by 8 suspended council chairmen in the State On arrival at the Assembly complex, Fayose went straight to the Speaker’s office and was received by the Speaker, Mr Funminiyi Afuye and the Deputy Speaker, Hakeem Jamiu where he met them behind closed-door for about 40 minutes. Fielding questions from journalists after the brief meeting, the former governor said that he received the summon on him on Television and decided to come to see the lawmakers. “Let me say that I got their summon on the news media and I called the speaker last night to confirm whether it is true or not and he confirmed it. You know my style, when EFCC wanted me, I told them I am here. “Today too, I have come to the Ekiti House of Assembly to tell them, I am here and if they need any clarification, I can answer because clear conscience fears no foe. I am saying it that I am available. “The Speaker confirmed that they don’t know that I will be coming. He said that the committee in charge are not immediately available. But I want to let them know that for any question whatsoever, I am a leader am here and I will continue to be here. So I drove all the way from Lagos to tell that there is no hiding place people like us. “I am ready to give account of my stewardship. I don’t play politics in that manner, that is why I am here.” On whether he was given a soft landing by the Federal Government on his case before the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), he said, the Fayose you know won’t compromise standard. I won’t follow multitude to sin. “While I want to believe that selective Justice won’t help our country. I have condemned it severely anybody who says when you join APC, you have become a saint. I have said it severally that I will not join APC. If I wanted a soft landing, I would have done it in the past. What is the soft landing, is it because I am before EFCC? ” However, another twist was added to the unfolding drama when Fayose in a phone call alleged that he narrowly escaped being attacked after left the Assembly and was on his way to his home town in Afao Ekiti. The former governor alleged that thugs in an unmarked black Hilux trailed him and hauled stones on his moving Range Rover SUV. He, however, did not give details of the attack on him but said he was grateful to God for sparing his life. He said he was not hurt and nobody in his entourage was hurt.
