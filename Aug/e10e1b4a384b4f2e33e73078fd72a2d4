Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has admitted that Alexis Sanchez’s exit, has left his squad a striker short. Solskjaer sanctioned Sanchez’s loan switch to Inter Milan, because he was not part of his first-team plans. United considered a number of forwards, including Juventus pair Paulo Dybala and Mario Mandzukic and Solskjaer claims they did not find any attractive propositions. “As I said on the way back from tour, we were still looking for one replacement for Romelu if he went. “We are one down to be fair, but we didn’t just find the right one. We didn’t find the answer that we wanted. “I’m still happy. We might be one down in the attacking line-up but we just didn’t get the right answers we wanted,” Solskjaer told reporters on Friday.
