Robert Echeverria, a Police officer with the New York Police Department, NYPD, is dead. NYPD confirmed that the 56-year-old officer shot himself in the head at his Laurelton home shortly after 6pm. Robert, who was assigned to the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group, was said to have committed suicide due to alleged depression. The latest incident came 24 hours after a 35-year officer, temporarily assigned to the Yankee Stadium, killed himself. Police responders were said to have rushed to his home in Queens, New York, after his wife called 911 to say he had shot himself. He was rushed to nearby Long Island hospital, also in Queens, where he died hours later. NYPD confirmed Robert’s death through its official Twitter handle, ‘@NYPDnews’. The police force advised people to seek help in any depressed situation they find themselves. “We are saddened to announce that the NYPD has suffered another tragedy today with the loss of one of our officers to suicide. “To anyone who may be struggling, know that there is support available. “Behind each of these resources are people that care about your well-being,” the tweet read. This is coming 24 hours after another officer of the New York Police Department (NYPD) committed suicide. The New York Commissioner of Police, James O’Neill also issued a statement urging distressed officers to seek help. “There is no shame in seeking assistance from the many resources available, both inside and outside the department. “Accepting help is never a sign of weakness; in fact, it is a sign of great strength,” O’Neill added.
