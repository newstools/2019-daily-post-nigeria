Big brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Ike on Wednesday revealed real reason he saved fellow housemate Omashola from possible eviction this week. DAILY POST recalls that Omashola was nominated alongside Esther, Tacha, Sir Dee, Venita, and Cindy. The housemates were nominated after an arena game challenge between two groups, the Enigma and the Legends which had former team emerge as the winner. Ike who has the Veto power saved Omashola and replaced him with Cindy. Ike’s decision did not go down well with some housemates who felt he would have saved Tacha or Frodd. But Ike speaking to Biggie during his diary session said he saved Omashola and not any other housemate as expected because he helped him stay longer in the house. “I saved Omashola because he helped me stay longer in the house. “From the first week about the stolen coin we have had a connection so I just thought to save him. “Plus I dnt know Cindy as much as I know other housemates in my team.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
