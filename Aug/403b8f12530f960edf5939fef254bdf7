Manchester United forward, Alexis Sanchez, will only play in the Carabao Cup and Europa League, if he fails to leave this summer, the UK Times reports. Sanchez, who earns almost £400,000-a-week at Old Trafford, has found the net on just four occasions since leaving Arsenal in January 2018. The Chilean has found himself way down the pecking order under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, with the Norwegian preferring Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford in attack. Solskjaer is also keen to give Mason Greenwood more playing time. And that will mean he only features in the Carabao Cup and Europa League. There is still hope he could move to Inter Milan, if the two clubs can agree terms over a loan move with an option to buy.
