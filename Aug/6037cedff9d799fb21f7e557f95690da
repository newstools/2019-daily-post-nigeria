Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq of Kwara state, Monday warned civil servants in the state against lateness and poor attitude to work. He said late coming and poor attitude to work certainly will not be tolerated. The governor who was at the state government secretariat in Ilorin, the state capital,at about 7.55am met most offices under lock with a large number of the workers yet to report to duty. Visibly unhappy about the development, he said late coming was not helpful for government business in the 21st century. For over one hour during the visit, only a few workers were at work as most of the offices were locked at 9am. According to a statement by his Spokesman, Rafiu Ajakaye, the governor said,” late coming and poor attitude to work, certainly will not be tolerated. ”He said the civil service should be business-like and efficient in service delivery. “As we try to support the civil service, to deliver on its mandate, we expect a drastic shift from old practices that have taken our state nowhere”, the governor added. Hundreds of the workers who came to work late were still locked outside the main gate by the time the governor left the secretariat a few minutes before 10am.
