The Governing Council of the Federal College of Agriculture, Akure, FECA, Ondo State, has explained why it sacked the Federal College of Agriculture Provost Dr. Emmanuel Moyinjesu. A member of the Governing Council of the school, Dr. Benson Enikuomehin, disclosed that Moyinjesu was replaced over some alleged violations of the institution’s working rules. He said following his removal, Dr Akinyemi Fadiyimu has been appointed as the new acting Provost of FECA. DAILY POST had reported how lecturers of the institution under the body of Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics, ASUP shut down academic activities in the tertiary institution over the development. According to the lecturers, Fadiyimu was not qualified for the post, stressing that he is not the most senior officer in the college compared to the administration skills of Moyinjesu. Speaking through the Chairman of the Governing Council, Chief Bayo Oyero, Enikuomehin said the decision to remove Moyinjesu came after series of advice, cautions and warning which he failed to adhere or comply with. Enikuomehin added that the infractions, which had earlier been reported to the Agricultural Research Council of Nigeria, ARCN, had become embarrassing and may sink the board and the system if urgent steps were not taken. He noted that following the notification of ARCN, which is the institution’s supervisory body, Moyinjesu failed to provide satisfactory explanation. He, however, said the ARCN ordered Moyinjesu to step aside pending the conclusion of the investigation by a panel and said “this necessitated the appointment of Fadiyimu as the acting provost” “The lecturers have the right to protest and demonstrate their grievances but it should be channeled through appropriate quarters. But the appointment of Fadiyimu should be seen as a round peg in right hole.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
