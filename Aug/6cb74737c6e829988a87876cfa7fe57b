Brazil legend, Rivaldo, on Tuesday, urged Barcelona president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, to sign Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain before the European transfer window closes on September 2. Neymar had already revealed his intention to leave PSG for Barcelona in this summer’s transfer window. “We know everything that happened to @neymarjr,” Rivaldo wrote on Instagram. “His departure from @fcbarcelona was wrong never he should have left one of the biggest clubs in the world. “But he is eager to come back and assume what he did. May the president of @fcbarcelona and all of the board don’t let @neymarjr go to another club. “I hope it gets resolves with @psg and he can get back to where he should never have left. Visca Barca.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
