Orji Kalu, the Senate Chief Whip, has condemned the attack on the former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu by some members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, in Germany. Senator Ekweremadu was to give a keynote address at the Second Igbo Annual Cultural Festival and Convention organised by Ndi-Igbo Germany in that city when a mob, which identified itself as members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), invaded the venue to attack the illustrious son of Ndigbo. Ekweremadu beaten up by suspected IPOB members in Germany [VIDEO] Reacting to the incident, Kalu, a former Abia State governor, described the act as uncivilized, unacceptable and barbaric. In a statement signed by his media office, Kalu urged the people of the South-East to respect leaders at all levels. Kalu appealed to the Embassy of Nigeria in Germany and the German government to ensure that those behind the act were made to face the law. According to him: “After watching a viral video of the physical attack on former Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweramadu, I was not only disappointed but irritated and disturbed with the action of some members of IPOB. The assault on the senator is a slap on Igbo leaders regardless of age, party affiliation and religion. “The perpetrators of the uncivilized act must face the wrath of the law. “Senator Ekweramadu is not only one of the Igbo leaders but also a prominent Nigerian and as such should be accorded due respect by all and sundry at home and abroad. “For the South East to move forward, the people of the region must embrace dialogue as a way of resolving pertinent issues and eschew violence.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
