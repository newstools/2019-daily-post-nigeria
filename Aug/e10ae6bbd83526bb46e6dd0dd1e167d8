Philippe Coutinho has admitted his time at Barcelona “didn’t work out” the way he had hoped, after he completed a loan move to Bayern Munich on Monday. Coutinho joined Barca from Liverpool in January 2018 and began well as he scored eight goals in his first 18 La Liga games. However, he struggled for consistency and failed to hold down a spot in the starting XI last season, playing only 22 matches from the start. The Brazil international had been suggested as a potential makeweight in a deal to take Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain back to Camp Nou, but Bayern secured his loan signing with a €120m (£110m/$133m) purchase option. “Concerning Barcelona, things didn’t work out the way we wanted. “But that’s the past. This is a new club, a big club, an important club. I hope I’ll be here for a long time and win lots of titles,” Coutinho told reporters at his Bayern presentation.
