Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate, Gedoni on Tuesday appealed to Nigerians to save Diane from possible eviction this week. DAILY POST had reported that seven BBNaija housemates, including Mike, Seyi, Mercy, Diane, Frodd, Jackie and Gedoni, have been selected for possible eviction this week. The housemates were nominated after the ‘Cruistopia team’ were defeated during the arena game challenge. Elozonam, who won the veto power on Sunday, saved Venita and replaced her with Frodd from her team, ‘Cruistopia’. Gedoni, while speaking to Big Brother during Tuesday diary session, said he wants Diane to be saved from eviction on Sunday because she needs to learn to be a better person from the housemates. Gedoni said this when Biggie asked who he would like to save from possible eviction on Sunday. “I see BBnaija as a training ground and as much as Diane feels she has learned I feel she needs to earn more. She stands a big chance if not evicted of being a better person. “Nigerians should vote for her and push her to stay in BBnaija house because I feel like she needs more training.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
