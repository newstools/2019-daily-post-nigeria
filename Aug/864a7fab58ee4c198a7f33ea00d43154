The Head of Service, Winifred Oyo-Ita, on Monday, failed to attend the opening ceremony of the 2019 Presidential Retreat for ministers designate and top government officials. Oyo-Ita was listed in the programme of the retreat as one of the resource persons. At the high table with President Muhammadu Buhari were the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari and National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno. Others were the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, Deputy Senate President, Ahmed Idris Wase, and the Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams
Oshiomhole. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) recently grilled Oyo-Ita over alleged N3billion contract scam. She was hospitalized after a four-day grilling. Oyo-Ita was interrogated for alleged abuse of duty tour allowance, money laundering and stealing of government funds. About N600million has been allegedly traced to the account of one of her key aides who has been unable to give any justifiable explanation for it. The EFCC has blocked the account and has initiated the process of obtaining an interim forfeiture clause to seize the cash.
