Barcelona defender, Gerard Pique, has said Super Eagles midfielder, John Ogu, reminds him of his former team-mate, Yaya Toure. Pique made this remark, during his video call with the former Hapoel Beer Sheva player, on Instagram. Ogu had called the Spaniard, to congratulate him after making his 500th appearance for Barcelona, in their 5-2 win over Real Betis on Sunday. Even though they have not played together on the field, they appear to be friends on social media. “You are a great guy and a monster. You remind me of Yaya Toure,” Pique. Ogu is currently a free agent after leaving Hapoel Beer Sheva at the end of last season.   When a Legend and a Top player say this to you,Be proud of yourself .
