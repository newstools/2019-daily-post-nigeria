While many Muslims would be rejoicing for the Sallah festivities on Sunday, some would be mourning as an auto crash has claimed eleven lives in Gusau, the Zamfara state capital. Eyewitness accounts say a Sharon vehicle that was coming from Abuja to Gusau carrying the eleven passengers collided with a trailer going out of Gusau, with the eleven passengers dying on the spot. The source said that the victims were from Jangeru district of Shinkafil local government area of Zamfara state, pointing out that they all resided in Abuja and were coming to their hometown (Jengeru) to celebrate the Sallah with their families. The state governor, Bello Muhammed Matawalle has already visited the scene and the mortuary at the Federal medical center in Gusau where the corpses were deposited. “I was shocked and short of words when I went to the scene and saw the blood of human being glowing like river due to such accident,” the governor said. He told newsmen that the autocrash could not be unconnected with over-speeding by the driver of the Sharon vehicle which the governor said has claimed eleven lives on the spot. However, Governor Matawalle assured that his administration would bear the cost of transporting the corpses back to their hometown for burial. He added that the state government would assist the bereaved families even though he did not mention the form of assistance the state government would offer the families.
