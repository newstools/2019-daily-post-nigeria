Arsenal defender, David Luiz, has hailed Burnley striker, Ashley Barnes for his outstanding performance against the Gunners in the Premier League on Saturday. Arsenal defeated Burnley 2-1 in the Premier League, thanks to two goals from Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. However, Ashley Barnes did score for Sean Dyche’s men at Emirates Stadium Luiz described Barnes as a ‘top player’ and wished the 29-year-old all the best of luck this season. “Ashley Barnes is a guy with a lot of quality, they have their style to play with two forwards inside the box, long balls, and they try to win the second balls,” Luiz was quoted by Arsenal’s official website as telling reporters after the match. “He is a top player, he’s in great shape and form and I just wish him all the best. He is someone who is fighting for his club and I enjoy to play against this type of player.” Commenting on the result, Luiz added: “It’s never easy against Burnley, they’re a typical Premier League team, it’s always difficult against them. “They fight for the goal, they know how to play direct ball, the second ball, fight for the corners, free-kicks and everything, but I think we understood their game well. “We make the plan very well, when we had the opportunity to play we play and when we had the opportunity to play long balls behind the back line we did also. I think in the end we did very good and we deserved the three points.” Luiz will hope to lead Arsenal to victory when they take on Liverpool in their next Premier League fixture at Anfield.
