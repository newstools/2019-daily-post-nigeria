Arsenal defender, Hector Bellerin, has hailed Dani Ceballos as “one of the best players he has seen in his career”. Ceballos has joined the Gunners on a season-long loan deal from Real Madrid, who he signed for in 2017. The Spain midfielder made his full debut for the Gunners in the 2-1 win over Burnley and produced a brilliant performance, providing two assists and winning the Player of the Match award. Bellerin, who is currently out with injury, told Arsenal’s official website: “I think Dani’s one of the best players I’ve seen in my career. “I’ve played with him since we were like 18 or 19 years old. We’ve played in the under-21s, we get on really well off the pitch. “He’s a great player, I think he’s going to be a great addition to the team and the Premier League is going to be very different to any other league, but he’s shown in training that he’s ready for it. “He’s up for it and he’s a player who will go through thick and thin to do the best for his team. He’s got a great heart and he plays for everyone around him. I think he’s a great addition.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
