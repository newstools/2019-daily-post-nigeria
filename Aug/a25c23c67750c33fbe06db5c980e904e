Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has hinted Nicolas Pepe is ready to play a more prominent role, when they take on Liverpool at Anfield in the Premier League this weekend. The Gunners shattered their transfer record to sign Pepe for £72million earlier this month, but he has been used sparingly so far. The Ivorian was brought on as a late substitute in the opening weekend victory over Newcastle, but played the entire second half in the win over Burnley. “The most important thing is, like a person, to help him and his family to feel comfortable here. “Now he is three weeks into working here with us. He didn’t do the pre-season here but he’s progressively feeling better. “For example, in the first match, he played 15 minutes in Newcastle, then he played 45 minutes against Burnley. “I think his individual performances are progressively getting better. For Saturday, he is maybe ready to have more minutes. “I am going to decide tomorrow, but really his progress has been positive and has been good for the team and for him. “The most important piece of the adaptation is to help him to feel easy and be comfortable with us,” Emery told the media on Thursday.
