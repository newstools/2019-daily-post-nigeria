A governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Bayelsa, Timi Alaibe, has written to the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) over the just-concluded state ward congresses. This followed controversy over the list of returning and electoral officials for the ad-hoc delegate elections ahead of the governorship poll in the state. A statement he signed at the weekend, alleged that names had been inserted to favour some aspirants, especially those loyal to the current government. Alaibe, a former Special Adviser to the President on Niger Delta Affairs, said it was a deliberate calculation to truncate his aspiration. He said: “They have failed this time around because no degree of intrigues, no amount of manipulation and propaganda can push me out of this race. “Nothing will change my decision to lift the lot of our people through purposeful leadership. I am here to stay and together we will win.” He said the method that is making the primary in Kogi State a smooth and rancour-free exercise is being thwarted in Bayelsa State for very narrow and selfish reasons. According to him, the irreducible minimum is to provide a level-playing field for all aspirants to test their acceptability among the delegates to the primary election. “While winning to us is not a do or die affair, the process of choosing the party flag bearer should be made unquestionably transparent such that in the end, the outcome would be acceptable to all so that we could stand as one to face the real opponent. “Our supporters and friends should, therefore, remain calm and stand firm believing that the national leadership of our great party would intervene and do the right thing,” Alaibe added.
