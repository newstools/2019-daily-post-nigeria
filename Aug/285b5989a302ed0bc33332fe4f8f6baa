Antoine Griezmann opened his Barcelona account, in their 5-2 win over Real Betis on Sunday night. The France forward made his debut for the club, in the 1-0 shock defeat to Athletic Bilbao, in their first LaLiga fixture. However, with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez watching from the stands, Griezmann seized his chance to shine at the Camp Nou. Griezmann got his first goal, after sliding to a cross from Sergi Roberto in the 41st minute. His second came in the 50th minute, with a well-placed left-footed shot that curled into the far corner, just out of reach of Betis goalkeeper Dani Martín. Carles Perez, Jordi Alba and Arturo Vidal also scored for Barcelona. Nabil Fekir and Loren Moron scored for Betis.
