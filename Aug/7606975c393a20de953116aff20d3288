Manchester United on Tuesday strongly condemned the racial abuse aimed at Midfielder Paul Pogba after the Red Devils’ 1-1 draw with Wolves in the Premier League on Monday night at Molineux. Anthony Martial’s first-half goal was cancelled by Ruben Neves after the break. Man United had the chance to take all three points after the referee awarded a penalty. Pogba stepped up after discussing with Rashford but saw his kick saved by Rui Patricio. The France World Cup winner was subsequently subjected to racist abuses on social media after the match. A statement from Man United’s official website read: “Everyone at Manchester United is disgusted by the racial abuse aimed at Paul Pogba last night and we utterly condemn it. ”The individuals who expressed these views do not represent the values of our great club and it is encouraging to see the vast majority of our fans condemn this on social media also. ”Manchester United has zero tolerance of any form of racism or discrimination and a long-standing commitment to campaigning against it through our #AllRedAllEqual initiative. “We will work to identify the few involved in these incidents and take the strongest course of action available to us. “We also encourage social media companies to take action in these cases.” Meanwhile, Man United will take on Crystal Palace in their next Premier League fixture on August 24 at Old Trafford.
