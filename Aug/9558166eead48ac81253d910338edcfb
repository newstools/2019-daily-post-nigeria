Barcelona manager, Ernesto Valverde, has warned Antoine Griezmann that he has to come into play more, following his underwhelming league debut for the LaLiga champions. The 28-year-old made his first league appearance for Barca, who suffered a shock 1-0 defeat to Athletic Bilbao in their opening fixture on Friday. The €120million signing from Atletico Madrid struggled to make an impact in absence of captain Lionel Messi, while Luis Suarez’s first-half injury left him isolated. “If he’s near the area, he is decisive and moves well, but you have to dominate the game for that to happen. “Putting him on the left side, we know that you are going to focus on the goal, but we have a side and players that can hold the game. “Of course, he is aware that we all expect a lot from many players and he has to look to get more into the game,” Valverde told reporters.
