Some suspected kidnappers have abducted one Abdulasis Sanni, the son of the Chief Imam of Ode Omi, a boundary community between Lagos and Ogun waterside. Sanni, DAILY POST learnt, just returned from Saudi Arabia where he studied Arabic. It was learnt that the assailants shot at two other sons of the Imam, as they stole a speedboat with which they escaped with their victims. The gunmen were reported to have also abducted two brothers, Jelili and Bamidele Adams. Jelili, a tailor, was reportedly sewing clothes for his customers for the Eid-el-Kabir celebration when the assailants struck. Condemning the act, the Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, said his administration was considering death penalty for kidnappers in the state. Abiodun disclosed this when some Islamic faithfuls paid him an Eid-el-Kabir visit in his Iperu country home. He informed that the judiciary in Ogun State is working towards enacting a bill to that effect, even as he made case for community policing. Abiodun added that the police were already on the trail of the kidnappers; assuring that the victims would be rescued unhurt.
