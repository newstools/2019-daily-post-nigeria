Liverpool are top of the Premier League, after the completion of Game Week 2 fixtures on Monday night. The Reds claimed a hard-fought 2-1 win at Southampton on Saturday, to claim first place. Although Manchester United threatened to topple them after taking the lead against Wolves last night, they conceded a stunning Ruben Neves strike to draw 1-1. Arsenal are in second spot, after also winning their first two games. Champions Manchester City occupy the third position, after a dramatic end to their 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur at the Etihad. City thought they had taken all three points, but VAR chalked off Gabriel Jesus’ stoppage-time goal for handball in the build up.
