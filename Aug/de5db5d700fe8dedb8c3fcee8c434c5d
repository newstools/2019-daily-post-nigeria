Paris Saint-Germain want to replace forward Neymar with Juventus’ Paulo Dybala, according to L’Equipe. The French champions lost 2-1 to Rennes last weekend, without Neymar featuring again. The Brazilina is being chased by Barcelona and Real Madrid this summer, with the European transfer market to close September 2. PSG will move for Dybala if Neymar eventually leaves, with Juventus reportedly interested in a player plus money deal. Dybala was initially linked with a swap deal that would have seen Romelu Lukaku leave Manchester United for Turin. But that proposition fell through and Lukaku has now joined Serie A rivals Inter Milan instead.
