Liverpool legend, Jamie Carragher has exposed a big weakness of Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City this season. Carragher explained that Man City have a big weakness in defending set-pieces this season. He also said that other teams in the English top-flight league will have to learn to exploit City’s weakness at set-pieces if they are to pick up points against the Premier League champions in this campaign. “The encouragement for other teams, is Man City look like they have a slight problem at set-pieces and it isn’t just what happened at the weekend,” Carragher said on Monday Night Football. “Teams like Tottenham are exploiting it. That is the one area where they do look like they have an Achilles heel. “The problem for teams is getting a corner in the first place because they are that good.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
