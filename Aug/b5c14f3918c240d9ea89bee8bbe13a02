Governor of Edo State, Governor Godwin Obaseki, and his predecessor, Adams Oshiomhole appears to have set aside the alleged rift between them as both men met on Monday in the latter’s village, Iyanmoh near Auchi area of the state. Recall that Obaseki had in a Catholic mass to mark the 80th birthday of former APC national chairman, John Odigie-Oyegun, said things will soon return to normalcy in the state as he and his predecessor do not have any fundamental issues. Also, in his special Sallah message to the Muslim community the governor had enjoined all citizens to eschew bitterness and rancour and work for the development of all of Edo State. Demonstrating this virtue, Obaseki visited the current APC National Chairman, Oshiomhole, and his mother, Hajia Aishetu in spite of the rumoured differences between both men. A statement by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communications, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, said the visit would likely unnerve a tiny fraction of people of the state. According to him, “The notion that these two men are adversaries is being propagated by morally and financially insolvent people seeking to profit off the challenges they have been working so hard to foment. You cannot blame such people really. Their talents and abilities are severely limited; so, it is in their collective interest to stoke tension and drive division, but I can tell you that they have already failed. “It is not in their interest for Edo State to peacefully progress; so, they will try to miscategorise this visit. This is what they’ve always done and it’s their stock in trade. “True leaders understand that they represent the people in whose interests they must serve. This is why His Excellency has always said that the resources of the state are for the people only, and not for a negligible minority and nothing can ever change this”.
