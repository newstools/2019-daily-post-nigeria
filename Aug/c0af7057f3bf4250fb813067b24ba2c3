Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate, Tacha has revealed why she has never won arena games since the reality show started. The BBNaija housemate said her strength was not in arena games, hence her failure during the games. Speaking with fellow housemate last night, Tacha, however, said if the arena games were within her strength, she will do it well. According to Tacha: “My strengths are not in arena games, but if it’s something I can do, I will do it and do it well.” Tacha’s disclosure followed an earlier surprise when she exposed her breasts and buttocks in a skimpy dress. The BBNaija housemate also took the responsibility of cooking and serving other housemates on Thursday. The Kalabari-born Instagram queen did all this in celebration of her boyfriend, Kingladi, whom she described as ‘Twinny.’ Her action came to the other housemates as a shock and they stared at her in disbelief because of her seemingly reserved nature so far in the house.
