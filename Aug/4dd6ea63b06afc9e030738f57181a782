Real Madrid striker, Luka Jovic could leave Zinedine Zidane’s men on loan before September 2 transfer deadline. According to Marca, Jovic has failed to impress Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, since joining the La Liga giants from Eintracht Frankfurt. DAILY POST had reported that the Serbian international joined Real Madrid from Eintracht Frankfurt in May. Jovic is yet to score for Zidane’s men following his €60million move to Madrid. The 21-year-old signed a five-year contract with the Los Blancos. He scored 17 goals in 31 Bundesliga appearances last season for Frankfurt and 10 more in the Europa League where Frankfurt lost to Chelsea on penalties in the semi-finals. Jovic will hope to feature for Real Madrid when they tackle Celta Vigo in their La Liga opener this weekend.
