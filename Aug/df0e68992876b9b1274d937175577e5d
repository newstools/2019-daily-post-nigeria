Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper, Hugo Lloris has admitted that the Premier League title race is between Manchester City and Liverpool. Spurs enjoyed one of their strongest seasons in years under Mauricio Pochettino last term, securing another top-four finish and reaching a first Champions League final. But Lloris now believes his side are aware they are the third runner in a two-horse race for the title. “One thing that we try to improve this season: if you cannot win, it’s important to not lose the game, especially against an opponent like Manchester City. “If you want to stay in contact with the best team in the Premier League, it’s important to get this feeling. There were some games that we lost [last term] that we should have drawn. We all know the difficulty of playing at City, so it’s a good feeling to build confidence. “With humility, Liverpool and City are the real contenders. We’re going to try our best to challenge for top spot, but it’s difficult to find the consistency. “We just need to try to use the experience of the last few years in the best way and it’s about details — to not lose a game, especially a game you do not deserve to win. You draw, you take a point and it’s very good because your rivals share the point with you. “Now it’s just to keep the consistency. Consistency is the key,” Lloris told the Evening Standard.
