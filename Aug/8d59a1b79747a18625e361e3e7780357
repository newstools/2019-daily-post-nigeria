The All Progressives Congress, (APC) in Ekiti state has joined others to congratulate the former governor of Ekiti state, Otunba Niyi Adebayo, on his inauguration as minister. Chairman of the party, Barrister Paul Omotosho, in a statement signed by the Director of Media and Publicity of the party, Elder Sam Oluwalana, pointed out that Adebayo is a round peg in a round hole in the ministry that was allocated to him. Adebayo was assigned the portfolio of Trade, Industry and Investment after his inauguration by President Muhamnadu Buhari in Abuja on Wednesday. APC said going by his wealth of experience, loyalty to the party and antecedents as a former Governor, the Iyin Ekiti -born politician will not let the people down. “It is our hope that Ekiti state and the country at large will benefit from the wealth of experience of Otunba Adebayo. The least expected from him is performance and nothing less,” Omotosho said. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
