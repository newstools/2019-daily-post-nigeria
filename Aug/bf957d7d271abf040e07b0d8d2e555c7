The 2019 edition of the Big Brother Naija, BBNaija,’ Pepper Dem edition, on Friday night, witnessed another moment. This is as Frodd and Seyi reconciled after their clash over alcoholic beverages, earlier reported. DAILY POST had reported that Seyi and Frodd engaged in a heated argument on Friday night after Biggie provided alcohol to the housemates.https://dailypost.ng/2019/08/17/bbnaija-big-man-dont-care-lineage-frodd-attacks-seyi-video/ Frodd queried Seyi over the availability of enough drinks and alcohol in the house, and the manner its distribution was being handled. Seyi who was not comfortable with the statement said: “I’m a big man where I’m coming from, I can’t fight about alcohol. I’m bigger than it.” Frodd in response attacked Seyi, adding that he does not care about his lineage as they all have equal rights in the house. However, in a twist of event, Mike during a game in the yard on Friday night, dared Seyi to hug and reconcile with Frodd within 20 seconds. Seyi approached Frodd, mumbled some words to him as they hugged and reconciled. VIDEO That’s why I have decided no to argue with anyone because of BBNaija. Seyi and Frodd 😊😊😊😊. Thanks Mike and Tacha#BBNaija#TeamMike#TeamTacha#TeamSeyi pic.twitter.com/g2sbJ9wOIX — Ups⬆️⬆️⬆️&down⬇️ (@erk_senem) August 16, 2019  Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
