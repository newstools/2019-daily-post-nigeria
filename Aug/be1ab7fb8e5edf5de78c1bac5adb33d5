Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has spoken about his admiration for midfielder, Jorginho, saying he will bring essential qualities to the team this season. Jorginho was booed at Stamford Bridge on numerous occasions last season, as debate reigned on whether he was favoured by Maurizio Sarri. The £57million signing from Napoli was also thought to be hampering N’Golo Kante’s performances, as Sarri pushed him higher up the field. Many thought Lampard might sell the Italy international, but the 41-year-old has kept the player. “I thought Jorginho was fantastic the other night. “He was constantly talking to people around him and constantly talking to the backline to drag them up and playing with quality. “The players are the ones who drive that when they get out there. He is a fantastic player. I saw that on the first day of training in Dublin. Talking about his attitude, he is a driver of the group and he has real quality. I am fortunate in midfield at the moment. “It gives us problems in terms of competition between Kante, Jorginho, [Matteo] Kovacic, [Ross] Barkley, [Mason] Mount, Ruben [Loftus-Cheek] is coming back and others. But Jorginho has really shown himself to be a top-quality player to me already. I am pleased to see his comments. He should be seen as Chelsea’s Jorginho. “As a player, you know that.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
