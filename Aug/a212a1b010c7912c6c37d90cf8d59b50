Four persons have been feared killed after rampaging cultists attacked Okwale community, Khana Local Government Area of Rivers State. The armed cultists, it was gathered, attacked Okwale community in what sources have described as a reprisal attack. It is unclear if the four persons killed were cultists but the attack has forced many residents out of the community. A source in the community told DAILY POST that, “The gunmen came on Tuesday morning heavily armed. Some of them did not cover their faces and they just started shooting any how. “It was when they left that we saw that four people were killed. Bullet even touched some people. “The shooting was so much that the armed boys left unchallenged.” Friday Nkee, a former member of the Rivers State House of Assembly who hails from the community described the incident as “unfortunate”. The Rivers State Police Command is yet to react to the latest attack by cultists.
