Paris Saint-Germain were left unhappy with the way their first direct meeting with Barcelona went on Tuesday, regarding the potential return of Neymar to Camp Nou, ESPN FC reports. Negotiations over a cash-with-a-player exchange started in Paris this week, with Philippe Coutinho and Ivan Rakitic the players Barca are keen to include in any potential deal. However, PSG told the Spanish giants during this meeting, that they want Coutinho, Nelson Semedo and €120million in exchange for Neymar. Barca’s best offer so far is Coutinho, Rakitic and €80million. It is understood that no major breakthrough was made during the meeting, which the Blaugrana are viewing as the first contact between the two clubs as negotiations step up. There will be another meeting between the pair on Thursday, during UEFA’s European Club Association gathering. PSG’s chairman and CEO Nasser Al-Khelaifi and his Barca counterpart Josep Maria Bartomeu are both expected to be in attendance.
