Following lack of breakthrough in the impasse that ensued in the treatment of Sheikh Ibrahim Zakzaky in India, the Shiites leader is on his way back to Abuja, Nigeria. He departed New Delhi in a commercial airline at 5pm Nigerian time. In a message sent through his office, the Sheikh said he had decided to return to the country. A top member of of Islamic Human Right Commission (IHRC) which negoatiated the medical treatment in India said that the Nigerian government’s interference and scuttling of the whole process rather than supervision as ordered by the court was the direct cause of the impasse. Meanwhile, he Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) has released an audiotape of El-Zakzaky. The Shiites leader complained about the Buhari government and his treatment in India. El-Zakzaky had refused treatment from those he called “unknown doctors” put in place to treat him in India. The Shiites leader insisted he wanted to be treated by those booked to treat him before he and his wife left from Nigeria.
