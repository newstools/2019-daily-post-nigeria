The Deputy Minority of the House of Representatives, Hon. Toby Okechukwu, has called for peaceful co-existence among Nigerians, irrespective of their ethnic, religious, and political backgrounds. He said that peace remained the foundation of any meaningful progress in any society, and urged Nigerians to always be their brother’s keeper. Hon. Toby conveyed this in his Eid-el-Kabir greeting to the Muslim faithful on Monday. He said: “The spirit of love that pervades the nation and among Nigerians of all ethnic, religious, and political backgrounds at Eid-el-Kabir should remind us of how we should live daily as one people. “I, therefore, urge Nigerians to continue to embrace the virtue of peaceful-co-existence as that is a sure means of making the much-needed progress as a nation. “I call on the Muslim faithful, and indeed all Nigerians to be their brother’s keeper and embrace sacrifice and forgiveness in the spirit of Eid-el-Kabir in order to move Nigeria forward. “In all that we do, we must always endeavour to pray for this nation, especially at this trying time, that God might guide our leaders aright and also lift Nigeria from its numerous challenges”. He wished the Muslim faithful a peaceful Sallah. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
