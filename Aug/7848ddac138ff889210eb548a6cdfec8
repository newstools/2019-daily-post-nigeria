Former Arsenal striker, Ian Wright, has said he was left ‘baffled’ and ‘confused’, after Unai Emery opted to start with a diamond formation in their 3-1 defeat to Liverpool. The tactic, which also caught Jurgen Klopp by surprise, meant Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson, were allowed acres of space on both the right and left flanks. Goals from Joel Matip and Mohamed Salah (2) sealed a comfortable win for the Reds. Emery changed his shape after going three goals down, switching to a front three of Nicolas Pepe, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette, but it came too late for Arsenal. Asked about the diamond formation, Wright told BBC Radio 5 live’s Monday Night Club: “It was one of the things that I was baffled by. “Before the game, I was hoping to see Lacazette, Pepe and Aubameyang as I believe that Liverpool playing with a high line were there for the taking and I was really excited about that. “And then to see the diamond or triangle giving up space to Alexander-Arnold and Robertson was confusing for me. “I don’t know if he’s doing it because he might use that system against lesser teams and it might work as he wants to keep it narrow. “I thought against Liverpool it was a tactic that was handing them the incentive and I thought we played a bit too deep. “The chances we got were mistakes from Liverpool and in the main, Liverpool were in control of that. “I would rather we just go there with potency that we have and show them this is what Arsenal are about now. This is how we are moving forward but it was a confusing one for me.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
