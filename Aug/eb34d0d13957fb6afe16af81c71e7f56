Evicted Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate, Gedoni, has revealed what he liked about fellow housemate, Khafi. Gedoni revealed that he loved Khafi due to her ‘positive vibe.’ The evicted BBNaija housemate made the disclosure during the Sunday live eviction show. Responding to a question from the host of the show, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu on what he liked about Khafi, Gedoni said: “Khafi has a positive vibe and she is sweet.” DAILY POST recalls that the BBNaija love-birds, Gedoni and Khafi, had on different occasions been caught in the house having passionate sex under the dulvet while other housemates were fast asleep.   #Gedoni says ‘#Khafi is sweet….’ I’m just thinking she maybe as sweet as the banana or an apple. Or, better still, like the pot of Jacob’s porridge or a jar of honey. ..the bottom line is that Gedoni has eaten enough to know. #bbnaija #bigbronaija #bbnaija2019#BBNaija4 #Bet9ja #BigBrotherNaija#BellaNaija #bbnaijapepperdem#Nigerian #nigeriaweddin #nigerians#nigeria #egypt #namibia #southafrica A post shared by  nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen) on Aug 26, 2019 at 3:11am PDT  Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
