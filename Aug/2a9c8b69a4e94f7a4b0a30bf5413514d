The Lagos State House of Assembly’s ad hoc committee for the screening of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s Commissioners and Special Advisers, on Friday, completed screening of the second batch of the nominees. The 16-man committee headed by the Chief Whip of the House, Rotimi Abiru, commenced the exercise for the second batch of 13 nominees on Thursday. The committee screened six of the 13 nominees on Thursday and the remaining seven on Friday. The nominees screened in the second batch were: Mr Oladele Ajayi, Mr Oluwatoyin Fayinka, Mrs Yetunde Arobieke, Mr Olanrewaju Sanusi, Mr Kabiru Abdullahi and Mr Joe Igbokwe. Also screened were: Mr Bonu Solomon Saanu, Mrs Lola Akande, Prince Anofi Elegushi, Mrs Solape Hammond, Mr Moruf Akinderu-Fatai, Mrs Shulamite Adebolu and Mr Tokunbo Wahab. At the end of the screening, Abiru told them that the House of Assembly would get back to them through the Governor. Speaking with newsmen at the conclusion of the exercise, Abiru said “This has been a very tough exercise; we have now taken the entire 38 nominees of the governor (25 in the first batch and 13 in the second batch). “From what we have seen, we have knowledgeable and intelligent people that actually understand how government will work to succeed. “It is a mix: we have technocrats, politicians and people who believe that it does not matter the divide they belong to, that what is mostly important is the urge and zeal to deliver service. “They have seen this as a call to service and have actually pledged before us that they will put all that God has endowed them with to ensure that good governance is witnessed with the present administration and that the people of Lagos will enjoy the dividends of democracy.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
