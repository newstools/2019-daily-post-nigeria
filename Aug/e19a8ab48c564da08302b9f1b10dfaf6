The Civil Liberties Organisation in Akwa Ibom State has stated that the Uyo prison centre lacked the facilities to become a ‘Correctional Centre’ as recently directed by the Federal Government. The Chairman of the CLO in the State, Franklyn Isong, who disclosed this to newsmen in Uyo after a visit to the Prison, lamented that the facility was yet to benefit from any serious remediation measures for smooth accommodation of inmates. The Uyo Prison, which was built in 1902 with a capacity of accommodating 613 inmates, now plays host to 1,200 inmates as deep gully erosion is threatening the facility. The CLO State Chairman, who was conducted round the complex by the State’s Deputy Controller, Mr. Jaiyeoba Babafemi, said, “We note with fear the imminent collapse of the perimeter fence of the Uyo Correctional Centre due to the very frightening incursion of gully erosion into the facility. “We discovered that the fence is now within less than three metres from the ravine created by the massive erosion. “We, therefore, call on the state government to consider carrying out a more permanent work to check the encroachment to prevent the perimeter fence from total collapse.” He also called for additional vehicles to be added to the five vehicles for easy transportation of the 1,200 inmates to and from courts, and stressed the need for quick dispensation of justice as the facility has already been overstretched by the over-bloated population of prisoners. “Only five vehicles are the only ones available to ferry these inmates to the over 52 courts within the jurisdiction of the prison,” Isong said.
