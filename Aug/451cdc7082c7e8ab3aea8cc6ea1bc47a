Alexis Sanchez has touched down in Italy, ahead of his loan move to Inter Milan, according to Sky Italia. Fans of the Serie A club turned out in their numbers to greet Sanchez at the airport on Wednesday. The 30-year-old has managed just five goals in all competitions for Manchester United in a miserable 18-month spell and has been keen to push through a move to the San Siro, in order to revive his stuttering career. Talks between United and Inter reached an advanced stage on Tuesday evening and the two clubs finally came to an agreement following weeks of intense speculation. The Red Devils will continue paying £300,000 of Sanchez’s £400,000-a-week wages, with Inter agreeing to contribute £100,000-a-week until the deal expires in June 2020.
