The Chief Imam of Lagos State, Alhaji Suleiman Abou-Nolla, on Saturday urged the Lagos State Government to declare the first day on Islamic calendar, Hijrah, a work-free day. The cleric made the call at an event commemorating the 1441 A.H Hijrah celebration held at the Lagos Central Mosque, Lagos Island. “January is usually perceived as the first month of the year, but in Islam, the Hijrah is the beginning of our own calendar year,” he said. “Just like in Osun, where the state government declared the day a work-free day, we urge our state government to make the Hijrah day a work-free day for the people of Lagos to celebrate it in a big way,” he said. In his response, Lagos State Deputy Governor, Dr Obafemi Hamzat, said that Lagos is a cosmopolitan state and as such, many things had to be considered before such holiday can be declared. “We cannot just make a decision that will affect our economy; there must be stakeholders interaction before such decision can be made. “By the time we relate with the people and we see that the impact is not negative, then we will consider it. “We are not just a government that will make decisions on people, we will make it together, so if the decision is the will of the people and everybody concerned, so be it,” he said.
