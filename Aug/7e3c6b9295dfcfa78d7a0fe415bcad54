Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has said that houses where kidnappers are found would be pulled down and their certificates of occupancy revoked. He spoke at the weekend during the inauguration of the Ogun State Security Trust Fund in Abeokuta, the state capital. “Ogun State will never be a home for criminals, whether big or small. For such people, hell will be a child’s play: we will smoke them out, arrest them and hand them over to the swift hand of justice. “And, for anybody, landlords or tenants, this is a very strong note of warning. Any property found to be serving as hideouts to criminals will not only be taken over by government, but such facility will also be demolished. “Whoever is found to be harbouring such criminals will be arrested and handed over for prosecution. “The aim of these security trust fund is to have the private sector support the government in addressing various security challenges facing our dear state. “This new and reinvigorated trust fund will be responsible for sourcing and efficiently deploying the resources towards achieving a safe and secured environment. “It is our sincere belief that with this Trust Fund, our security will be further strengthened to provide a more secured environment where our people will live a more prosperous life,” he said. Abiodun called on traditional rulers, community development associations, civil society organisations, business owners and the entire citizenry to cooperate with the Government and security agencies to curb crimes in the society.
