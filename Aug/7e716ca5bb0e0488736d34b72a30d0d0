The All Progressives Congress (APC) has hailed Nigerians especially Muslim faithful on the commemoration of Eid ul-Adha. The party urged all to imbibe the lessons of the important Islamic festival which exemplifies sacrifices and fulfillment of promise as demonstrated by Prophet Ibrahim (RTA). Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, APC National Publicity Secretary, in a statement on Saturday, said: “As we celebrate the Sallah feast with family, friends and loved ones, Muslim faithfuls and indeed all Nigerians are implored to show love to neighbours and cater for the less privileged around us. “In our national life, Eid ul-Adha is a reminder for us to make our individual and collective sacrifices for the well-being, unity, peace and development of our dear country, Nigeria. We must, therefore, shun the disruptive and divisive utterances and actions emanating from some unpatriotic quarters lately. “In our private capacity, official duties, wherever we find ourselves, we must all exhibit the pan-Nigerian spirit. We should embrace our country’s diversity and harness it for good. We must see every Nigerian as a brother. We should take advantage of his strength, help him with his weakness. That is the only way we can grow as a country.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
