The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has said the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu would be closed indefinitely on August 24. A statement on Saturday in Lagos by FAAN’s General Manager, Corporate Affairs, Mrs Henrietta Yakubu, said the closure is to enable the Authority carry out major repairs on the runway. “The closure would address existing safety and security concerns at the airport,” the statement said. It added that the closure of the runway would take effect by 12:00 a.m. on August 24. She said a date to reopen the runway would be communicated in due course. Yakubu further said, “FAAN remains committed to its core values of safety, security and comfort of airport users in the country.” It would be recalled that the immediate past Minister of State, Aviation, Hadi Sirika, had said during his recent ministerial screening that the airport would be closed down because of the state of the runway. He also said the airport might be downgraded, sparking controversy as different personalities and groups urged the government against the move, citing the importance of the airport in the region.
