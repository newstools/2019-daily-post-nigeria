The statement added that the governor, in efforts to ensure security of the people launched ‘Operation Iron Gate’ and made available 80 brand new Ford Ranger operational vehicles for its takeoff. The governor said the setting up of the task force was in obedience to his promise to secure lives and properties of the residence of the state. Noting that his government has continued to make calculated and affirmative efforts to deliver on campaign promises, he promised to “explore positive means to offer good governance, democratic dividends and overall development to the people”. He said, “It is the sole responsibility of government to provide for the welfare, peace and security of her citizens. Consequently, on assumption of office, we have taken very critical, positive and deliberate steps to ensure that we meet our people at the point of their needs. “It is very imperative that we have to take deliberate steps to stop criminals who have begun to threaten the peace of our state and land.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
