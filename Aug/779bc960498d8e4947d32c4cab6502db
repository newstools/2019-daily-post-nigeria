Nigerian forward, Alex Iwobi, has said that he was almost certain that he would return to Arsenal at some point soon. The 23-year-old said he would be going back to north London because he misses the players and staff of Arsenal after leaving the Emirate Stadium for Everton barely a week ago. The Super Eagles playmaker completed a switch from Arsenal to Marco Silva’s side in a five-year contract on transfer deadline day. In a new video released on Arsenal’s Twitter account, the midfielder said, “I’m going to miss the players, the staff, I’m even going to miss going to Hale End where all the young players go. “I’m going to miss little things like that, but I’m sure when I have a day off and I’m in London, I will still go back and visit.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
