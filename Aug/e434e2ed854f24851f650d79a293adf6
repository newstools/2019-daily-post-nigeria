The Governor said rumour peddlers were on a mission to create panic and tension in the State. The Director-General of Media and Publicity to the Kogi State Governor, Kingsley Fanwo made the denial in Lokoja on Tuesday. The news circulated on social media platforms on Tuesday about an attack by suspected Fulani herdsmen in a Motor park in Lokoja. “Our attention has been drawn to some gory pictures on social media platforms, purporting that some herdsmen attacked a popular motor park in Lokoja and killed all passengers found there,” the statement added. “We wish to allay the fears of commuters and residents of the State that nothing like that ever happened as all motor parks in the state remain peaceful. Our security operatives are also ensuring the security of lives and property in the State. “It is instructive to note that the intent of the promoters of such fake news was to create panic in the state for political reasons. “The Governor of Kogi State wishes to assure commuters and residents of his continued commitment to guarantee their safety and security at all times. “Kogi remains the second most peaceful State in the Federation as the Yahaya Bello administration has been able to combat insecurity to a large extent. “We also wish to warn those hatching evil plans against the State for political reasons to have a rethink or have themselves to blame as Government will do anything within the ambit of the rule of law to protect its citizens. “We urge all Kogites to go about their lawful businesses without fear as security agents are already investigating the source of such fake news peddled to create tension and panic.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
