Paul Parker has said Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold “can’t defend like Aaron Wan-Bissaka” and considers Manchester United’s Aaron Wan-Bissaka to be the best right-back in the Premier League. The Red Devils spent £50million to prise Wan-Bissaka away from Crystal Palace this summer. The full back drew plenty of praise for his United performances during pre-season and looked assured again, as they beat Chelsea 4-0 on Sunday. Alexander-Arnold, in contrast, was caught of position at times as Liverpool eased to a 4-1 win over Norwich. Parker told the WeAreTheBusbyBoys podcast of Wan-Bissaka: “I’ve said it many times, I watched him often last year, I just like what he does. “People talk about the lad at Liverpool [Alexander-Arnold] but he can’t defend like Wan Bissaka, whose defending and positioning is very good. He wants to defend, he loves it. “And every time he won a tackle [against Chelsea] there was no doubt he won it cleanly. You would think he had been there years. “I’m judging him as a defender. He is the best right back in the Premier League. “There’s always a question about him going forward, he can learn that, he will get better and better. He’s playing for a team who will allow him to do that. “If you’re playing next to him as a centre-half, you’re saying to yourself ‘there’s my get out of jail card’ because he wants to make those tackles and wants to protect that right hand side. “He doesn’t want to give anyone a yard or see anybody deliver crosses from his side of the park. I thrive on that. I love that.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
