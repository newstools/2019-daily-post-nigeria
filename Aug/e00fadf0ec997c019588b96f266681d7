Paris Saint-Germain, PSG, will reject a loan-to-buy offer by Barcelona for star forward, Neymar, reports ESPN. While PSG are ready to let Neymar leave, they want at least the €222million, they paid to bring him to the club recouped. Even if Barca agreed to pay that amount next year after a loan, the Ligue 1 champions do not believe they would make the payment in a lump sum, which is another sticking point. PSG manager, Thomas Tuchel has already said Neymar will not leave the club this summer, except they sign a replacement. Neymar was once again missing as his team lost 2-1 to Rennes in their first away game in Ligue 1 this season. The 27-year-old attacker has been recovering from an ankle injury that has ruled him out of action since early June.
