President Muhammadu Buhari has charged Nigeria contingent to the 12th Africa Games scheduled to hold in Rabat, Morocco to stay clear from performance enhancing drugs. NAN reports that he spoke during the ceremony of handing over the athletes to the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC) on Wednesday in Abuja. Buhari, who was represented by the Secretary of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, urged them to win only clean medals for the country.

President of the NOC, Habu Gumel, said it was the first time the Africa Games would be used as a qualifiers for the Olympics. He noted that it was an opportunity for the athletes to give their best so as not only to win medals but also qualify for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.
