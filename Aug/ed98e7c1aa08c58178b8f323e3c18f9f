Manchester United legend, Ryan Giggs has criticised Striker Marcus Rashford for not demanding to take the penalty ahead of Midfielder Paul Pogba during the club’s 1-1 draw against Wolves in the Premier League on Monday night. Giggs described Rashford’s decision to allow Pogba took the penalty against Wolves as a ‘shame’, adding that the England international should have taken it after scoring a penalty in Man United’s 4-0 win over Chelsea last two weeks. Anthony Martial’s first-half goal was cancelled out by Ruben Neves after the break. Man United had the chance to take all three points after the referee awarded a penalty. Pogba stepped up after discussing with Rashford and saw his kick saved by Rui Patricio. “Rashford is a centre-forward, scores a goal in his first league game, penalty, you get another penalty in the next game, you’ve got to be demanding to take it,” Giggs told Optus Sport. “It’s a shame, he was really disciplined tonight. “Pogba has not got a great record either of scoring penalties. He doesn’t score every penalty he takes. “It seems like whoever wins the penalty gets to take it, I wonder if [Harry] Maguire or [Victor] Lindelof win the penalty, who gets to take it? “I was surprised. I’m not surprised that Paul Pogba stepped up, because he’s that kind of player, which is obviously encouraging. “I’m just surprised when you’ve scored a penalty the game before, that you get a penalty the next game you don’t take it. So you open up to criticism then, because if Marcus misses it then OK, you can miss a penalty, but now everybody is talking about why Marcus didn’t take it, why did Pogba take it? “It should have been Marcus. It’s a strange one because before the game you usually have a designated penalty taker and you would think it would be Marcus after scoring last week. Like I say, he’s done it the week before.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
