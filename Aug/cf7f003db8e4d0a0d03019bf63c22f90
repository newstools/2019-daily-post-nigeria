Former Arsenal player, Charlie Nicholas is claiming that Liverpool will ‘expose’ summer signing, David Luiz, when they clash this weekend in the Premier League. Luiz swapped Chelsea for Arsenal on deadline day and made his full debut for the Gunners in last week’s 2-1 victory over Burnley. The 32-year-old has extensive experience in the Premier League and will be tasked with thwarting Liverpool’s deadly attack at Anfield on Saturday. “I am hesitant, to say the least. “It has been a good start, with Arsenal having won their first two matches for the first time in 10 years, so it tells you exactly how they usually start the season. “The team will definitely be positive going into it, but the defensive frailties are still there and with Liverpool playing their front three, they will have pace and menace to deal with. “The other way to look at it, is that it will be a test to see where Arsenal are in relation to the top four. And a huge question on the day will be whether David Luiz will be exposed. “The start is crucial, especially at Anfield, as Arsenal need to get through the first 20-25 minutes without damage. It is about getting through the first phase of the game and still being in it,” Nicholas told Sporting Life.
