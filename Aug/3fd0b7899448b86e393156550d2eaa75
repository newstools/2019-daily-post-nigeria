A driver, Sulaimon AjigbotAllah, 42, has been remanded in prison for allegedly defiling his nine-year-old daughter. AjigbotAllah was arraigned before an Iyaganku Chief Magistrates’ Court on Monday. Chief Magistrate O.O Adisa, who did not take the plea of AjigbotAllah, ordered that he be remanded in Agodi prison, pending legal advice. Adisa ordered the police to send a copy of the case file to the Oyo State Directorate of Public Prosecution for legal advice. He adjourned the matter until September 27 for mention. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Sgt. Folake Ewe, told the court that AjigbotAllah allegedly defiled his nine-year-old daughter on Aug. 11, at about 9 p.m. at Atipe Oke – Ofa, Ibadan. She said that the matter was reported to the State Criminal Investigation Department, Iyagañku, by the suspect’s neighbour. The offence, he said, contravened provisions of Section 218 of the Criminal Code Cap 38, Vol II, Laws of Oyo State 2000. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that section 218 stipulates life imprisonment with or without cane for defilement if defendant is found guilty.
