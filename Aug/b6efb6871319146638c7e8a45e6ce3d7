The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Sunday condemned the attack on former Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, by some members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, in Germany. Senator Ekweremadu, who was attending the 2nd Annual Igbo Cultural Festival as speaker and special guest of honour at the event organised by the Ndi-igbo Germany community, was assaulted and publicly humiliated by IPOB members. Reacting, the PDP described the attack on Ekweremadu as unacceptable and portrays the image of Nigeria in bad light. In a statement signed by its spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan, the main opposition party charged the Nigerian Ambassador to Germany as well as the German government to ensure that perpetrators of the act are dealt with. The statement reads: “We amply note that the former Deputy Senate President was attending the 2nd Igbo Annual Festival in Germany where he was duly scheduled as a speaker and special guest of honour when he was attacked. “We insist that the attack on Senator Ekweremadu was uncalled for, unprovoked and cannot be justified under any guise whatsoever, such assault on a leader is completely unacceptable and does not portray our nation in proper light. “We therefore charge the Nigerian Ambassador to Germany as well as the German government to take appropriate decisive action on the matter.” PDP also urged the Federal Government, particularly, the National Assembly, “to take urgent comprehensive step to address issues leading to acts of resentment and agitations by Nigerians within and outside the country in the last four years, under President Muhammadu Buhari’s misrule”.
