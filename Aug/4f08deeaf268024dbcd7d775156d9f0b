Manchester City star, Aleks Zinchenko has revealed what Manager Pep Guardiola told them after their disappointing 2-2 draw with Tottenham at the weekend. According to him, Guardiola praised his upset players in the dressing room after VAR’s controversial decision that denied them the maximum three points. City took the lead twice against Spurs and thought they had a third goal only for Gabriel Jesus’ late goal to be ruled out by VAR City suffered the same situation at West Ham last week after Raheem Sterling’s shoulder was adjudged to be fractionally offside. The players were upset after the game but were reassured by their manager about the performance. “The manager said we played well. We had enough chances and he has no doubts about us but it is what it is,” Zinchenko told Manchester Evening News. “They are the rules and the rules for everyone. Unfortunately, it is the second time in a row the VAR is not on our side but we have to accept that and be on top of it. “Everyone was so upset. VAR has decided again and that made us upset. “In this kind of situation, you have to be all together as a team. The season is going to be so long. It is what it is. “We’ve dropped two points today but nothing special happened. I’m pretty sure every team in the Premier League is going to drop some points as well.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
