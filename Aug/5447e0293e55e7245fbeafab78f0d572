Reno Omokri, former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has reacted to the list of 80 Nigerians arrested by the United States, US, government for fraud-related crimes. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, in a press statement released in Los Angeles, California on Thursday by US attorney Nick Hanna, announced arrest of “many Nigerians”, in an ongoing investigation related to fraud cases. DAILY POST had reported that FBI named Valentine Iro, 31, and Chukwudi Christogunus Igbokwe, 38, both Nigerian citizens as lead suspects, adding that the duo allegedly coordinated with others to launder the funds from victims. The arrest of ‘80 Nigerians’ has stirred diverse reactions from Nigerians on social media even as some described the list of Nigerians as partial and tribalistic. Omokri faulted the decision to link those arrested to people of the South East. In a series of tweets, the former presidential aide said it was wrong to cast aspersions on Igbo people over the arrest. Omokri tweeted: “Before you wrongly blame all Igbos for the FBI action, note that we have a Governor caught on camera stuffing bribes in his pocket. he was reelected, after the corruption hating General @MBuhari lifted his hands as his candidate. We are all guilty! “It is wrong to cast aspersions on Igbos due to the names on the FBI’s suspects list. I don’t condone what they are alleged to have done. But Sani Abacha is the world’s biggest ever thief, yet a stadium is named after him in Kano. We’re all guilty! “It is only you in Nigeria who see things through the prism of Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa & Fulani. outsiders, don’t see that. They just see Nigeria. Your value is irrevocably linked to Nigeria’s value. So keep laughing that most of the FBI names were Igbo.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
