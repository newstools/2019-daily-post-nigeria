Alex Iwobi has said that a ‘demanding’ Everton manager like Marco Silva, will improve his performances. The Nigerian midfielder left Arsenal for a fee around £40million this summer, signing a five-year deal with the Toffees. Iwobi made his debut in their 2-0 defeat to Aston Villa in Friday’s Premier League game. The 23-year-old replaced Gylfi Sigurdsson in the 61st minute of the game and could have got a goal in the match, but was denied by the post. “Before I came on, the manager said he wanted me to try to add some creativity. “I felt sharp. And when I struck that ball [that hit the post], I thought it had gone in. It’s my aim to try to get more goals and assists. “I have been working on that in training with the manager and the players, so hopefully I’ll be able to help my team get more goals. “The manager demands a lot and he always reminds me in training of what I need to do. He’ll keep on helping me and improving me as a player,” Iwobi told Everton TV.
