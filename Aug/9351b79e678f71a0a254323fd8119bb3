Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Cindy has spoken on eviction from the ‘Pepper dem’ edition this Sunday. DAILY POST recalls that Cindy was nominated for eviction alongside Tacha, Ike and other team members from ‘The Icons’ group. They were nominated for eviction after team Cruisetopia defeated them at Arena challenge on Monday. Cindy, while speaking to Biggie during her diary session on Sunday afternoon, said she is confident that she would not be evicted from the BBNaija reality show this Sunday. When asked why she feels confident about being saved from eviction, Cindy told Biggie that she did nothing to be selected by Big Brother to be on the show, hence the favour that brought her to the house will take her farther. “I feel I’m prepared for the eviction tonight and would make it through. “I was scared at the beginning of the week but realized that favour got me here and I’m sure it will see me through to the very end. Cindy added that if evicted, She would put herself out to the world more and get better clients and let people know what she does. “There is no specific content, I’m open to whatever comes my way aside from what I do if evicted today. “I know my life would not be the same again after I leave this house and I’m very grateful to Biggie for selecting me to be a part of the show,” Cindy added.
