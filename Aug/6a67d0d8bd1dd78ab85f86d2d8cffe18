Shehu Sani, former Kaduna Central Senator, has hinted on South West and South East losing the 2023 presidency. Sani said both regions may lose the 2023 presidency if clamourings for it were not united. The former Senator spoke in Abuja on Saturday at an interactive session organised by the Correspondents Chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, FCT Council. He stated that the two geopolitical zones must unite and field a single presidential candidate if they want to produce the next president. Sani said while it may be unfair for the North to hold on to power after 2023, the southern bloc must unite to confront the posture of those in power as against its inter-regional campaign on who is qualified or otherwise to run for 2023 from the South. According to Sani, “It will be unfair for other sections of the country if one section uses its topographic or demographic advantage to hold onto power, knowing full well that it was not the topography or demographic advantage that delivered them to power. “Rotation of power is what I prescribe and stood for, whether that power goes to the East or West, it is dependent on the people from the South. “What I will say is that there is a possibility of producing a Northern president in 2023 if the East and the West remain divided in their resolve on the governance of the Country. “It is this division that will be exploited by those who are proposing the issue of competence,” Sani stated Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
