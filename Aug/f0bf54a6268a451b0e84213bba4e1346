Former Liverpool manager, Rafa Benitez has claimed that Jurgen Klopp’s current team is stronger than his side that won the UEFA Champions League in 2005. Benitez led Liverpool to Champions League glory in Istanbul, while Klopp led the Reds to win the club’s sixth European Cup in Madrid earlier this year. The 59-year-old became the first Liverpool coach to lift the European Cup since 1984 when the Anfield club defeated AC Milan on penalties in Turkey. Asked during a Q&A with The Athletic to compare the two sides, Benitez said: “I’m really proud of what we achieved in 2005, but I have to say that the 2019 team is stronger already. “The team that we had, what we had at this time was a great team effort and a lot of character, as well as commitment on the pitch. “This team have the intensity and the quality that can make the difference in games.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
