Bayern Munich’s CEO, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, has confirmed that Barcelona midfielder, Philippe Coutinho, is set to join the club on a one-year loan deal. Rummenigge also said that the defending Bundesliga champions, will have an option to buy Coutinho after the loan period ends. “I can confirm [Bayern sporting director] Hasan Salihamidzic and I were in Barcelona last Wednesday. And we reached an agreement with both the club and the player over a transfer. “The player is expected here in Munich in the next days, Sunday or Monday at the latest. He’ll do his medical and then sign his contract. “I must thank Barcelona. I am on very friendly terms with the Barcelona president [Josep Maria Bartomeu], and that, at the end of the day, maybe helped us transfer this player to FC Bayern. It’s a very important player for us, not only because of his name, but also because of the way he plays. His quality will help our attacking game. We are happy,” Rummenigge told reporters after his club’s 2-2 Bundesliga draw with Hertha Berlin on Friday. Barca have been trying to offload the Brazilian playmaker all summer, after he became surplus to requirements. With the summer signing of Antoine Griezmann and the pursuit of Neymar, Coutinho always knew his future was outside the Camp Nou. The 27-year-old was linked with a return to the Premier League before the English transfer window last week, but proposed moves to both Tottenham and Arsenal failed to materialise.
