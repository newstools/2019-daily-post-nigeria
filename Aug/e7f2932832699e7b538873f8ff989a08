NAN reports that Ngige commended the vendors for being good citizens by choosing to earn a decent living through newspaper vending, instead of engaging in criminal activities. He expressed government’s desire to encourage them in their efforts, stating that government would enroll some of their members into the N-Power programme, a platform where Nigerians could access skills acquisition for development. According to him, the vendors are also helping government through their work. “Your association has helped the labour ministry because newspaper marketing is part of information dissemination. “Through your activity, we get information on brewing labour unrest, and try to nip them in the bud through conciliatory meetings.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
