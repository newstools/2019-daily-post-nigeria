Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate, Frodd has disclosed the real reason his fellow housemate, Elozonam put him up for possible eviction this week. DAILY POST had reported that seven BBNaija housemates including: Mike, Seyi, Mercy, Diane, Frodd, Jackie and Gedoni have been selected for possible eviction this week. The housemates were nominated after the Cruisetopia team were defeated during the arena game challenge. Elozonam, who won the veto power on Sunday, saved Venita and replaced her with Frodd from her team, ‘Cruisetopia’. However, Elozonam’s decision to save Venita rather than Diane generated diverse reactions from housemates and BBNaija fans. But Frodd, while speaking with Big Brother on Tuesday night during his diary session, said Elozonam did not put him up for eviction for personal reasons as suspected by other housemates. According to him, ”Elozonam put me on the Nomination list to test my capacity to survive. “I don’t think it was for any personal reasons, and his save-and-replace was a good one.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
