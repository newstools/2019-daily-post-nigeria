The Bishop of Catholic Diocese of Jalingo, Bishop Charles Hammawa, on Thursday, condemned the killing of Rev. Fr. David Tanko of St. Peter’s Catholic Parish Amadu, Taraba by yet- to-be-identified bandits. DAILY POST had reported that a group of unidentified bandits, on Thursday attacked and killed Reverend Father David Tanko, a catholic priest at Kufai Amadu in Takum, Taraba State. According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Hammawa, in an interview with newsmen in Jalingo, described the killing of the priest as shocking. The Bishop said Fr Tanko was killed between Kasuan Haske and Tortsee on his way to Amadu from Takum in Takum Local Government Council of Taraba. He said “We received the news of his death with shock and great sadness, the diocese is mourning. “We have been preaching peace and making efforts to bring the parties that were enmeshed in crisis in the area together for a round table discussion. ”For a priest who has been preaching peace to be killed in this most gruesome manner is pathetic, to say the least, a priest belongs to all. “For now, we are not pointing accusing finger at any group for being responsible.’’ The Bishop told NAN that the state Police Command had told him that they were investigating the case. “We pray that the perpetrators will be brought to justice. “Our basic concern now is to give him a befitting burial. We don’t want any group to go on reprisal. “Going on reprisal will only worsen the situation,” he added. Hammawa said that the wake in honour of the priest will hold on Monday, Sept 2, 2019 while the burial would take place on Tuesday at the Diocesan Cemetery in Jalingo.
