DAILY POST recalls that Omashola was nominated for eviction alongside Tacha, Ike and other team members from ‘The Icons’ group.

He stated that most housemates aside Mike think he is always fine but most times despite being a tough person, he needs a pat on the back. Omashola however expressed love for Biggie, as he described him as his father. Omashola told Biggie: “I beg you don’t forget me you get my number one day when the program don finish call me abeg. “I connect with you as a father, anywhere I am in the world if I hear your voice I go they alright, please just check on me. “As much as I’m stubborn I want someone to pat me on the back and assure me of my progress. “So far you are the only one that calms me down, you did a lot in my life. “Nobody checks on me because I’m strict and they think I’m okay but sometimes I need a pat on my back. “I love you so much Biggie, would appreciate to see or receive your call after I’m evicted.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
