Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, was very impressed by the performances of Dani Ceballos and David Luiz, in their 2-1 win over Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday, but bemoaned conceding one goal. Ceballos, who is on loan from Real Madrid, set up both goals and was named the Man of the Match. Luiz also looked composed in his first outing since leaving Chelsea on deadline day. Emery was impressed with both, though was quick to praise the contribution of the entire team including teenager Joe Willock, who was playing in a deeper midfield role. Asked how he thought Luiz and Ceballos fared, Emery told BT Sport: “Yes, very good. Their first match here at home officially. “And really to share with other players – young players, today I think Willock did one step more ahead to improve – and I want to speak about the team. “Individually also good, Pepe good, Dani good, David Luiz good, and other players also. And I think continuing with Laca scoring, with Aubameyang scoring, is good. “The only thing we didn’t do today was keep a clean sheet, but we will.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
