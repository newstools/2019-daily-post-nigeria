Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu on Sunday placed a N1 million bounty on anyone who gives useful information about overseas travel itinerary of Igbo leaders. Kanu disclosed this in a live broadcast on Radio Biafra, Sunday night. The IPOB leader while confirming that his members were responsible for the attack on former Deputy Senate President, Dr Ike Ekweremadu on Saturday said a member of the group has made money available for credible information anytime Governors of the Southeast and other leaders from the zone were traveling. DAILY POST had reported that Senator Ekweremadu, who was attending the 2nd Annual Igbo Cultural Festival as a Speaker and special guest of honour at an event organised by the Ndi-Igbo Germany community, was beaten up and publicly humiliated by suspected IPOB members in a viral video. Kanu was quoted as saying “if you are working in any Government House in Southeast and you know which city in the world the governors are going to be, inform us so that we will mobilize for him and you will be rewarded with N1m. “They and not the Federal Government of Nigeria proscribed IPOB.” “They said they proscribed IPOB to douse rising tension in the region. What caused the tension, because the military raided my house in Umuahia,” Kanu added.
