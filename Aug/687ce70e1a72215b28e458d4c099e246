Former Brazil striker, Rivaldo, has said Real Madrid will get better under Zinedine Zidane while urging club supporters not to panic yet. Los Blancos were held to a shock 1-1 draw by Real Valladolid last weekend, dropping points for the first time this season. The result raised doubts that carried over from last season, a campaign that saw Real Madrid go through both Julen Lopetegui and Santiago Solari, before re-hiring Zidane to manage the team. But Rivaldo says Zidane’s return will be enough to lead the Spanish club back to where they belong, after settling for a third-place finish last season. “Even dropping points at home last weekend in La Liga, I don’t see why the club and fans might start to panic, after all we are just starting the league and Barcelona also lost their first game. “Those kind of thoughts should only come after 10 matches or so, and if things are not improving. “Zinedine Zidane is re-setting his tone on the team and soon things should get better. The club will battle for La Liga and Champions League, but I don’t doubt that they might make a move in the transfer market before the transfer deadline,” Rivaldo told BetFair.
