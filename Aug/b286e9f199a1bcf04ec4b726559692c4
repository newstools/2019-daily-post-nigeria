2019 Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Frodd seems to have landed in serious trouble over his action on Saturday night. Frodd may receive a strike or even be disqualified for his actions after Saturday BBNaija Party night. Frodd after the party was seen on Esther’s bed without no underwear trying to touch and caress Esther’s body. Esther hesitated and warned Frodd to wear his boxers back on at several times but he refused. This attracted Biggie’s attention as he called Frodd to an emergency diary session. After the diary session, Frodd who was earlier on Esther’s bed, retuned suddenly to his own bed. It is not sure what Biggie told him at the diary session as it was not aired to the BBNaija fans but there is the possibility that Frodd may be issued a strike or be disqualified for harassment. DAILY POST recalls that ex-BBNaija 2017 housemate, Kemen was disqualified from the reality show after he touched TBoss while she was sleeping. Displeased with Kemen’s action, “Biggie” owner of the #BBNaija house noted that the move was not mutual, adding that his action was an infringement on TBoss’ right.
