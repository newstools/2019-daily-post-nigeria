Manchester United forwards, Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard, have sent messages of support to Tammy Abraham, after the Chelsea striker was targeted with racist abuse, following his penalty miss against Liverpool in the Super Cup. Chelsea and Liverpool were forced to settle the Super Cup with a shootout, after it ended 2-2 after 120 minutes in Istanbul on Wednesday evening. Liverpool scored all five of their penalties, before Abraham had his effort saved by Adrian. The Blues player was then subjected to a series of abusive posts on social media after the match. Abraham has now received messages of support from the United duo. Rashford posted on Twitter: “Keep your head held high @tammyabraham we’ve all had them saved, that’s football. We should be celebrating young English talent not this…’ Lingard posted a picture of himself with Abraham alongside the message: “Head up brother stand strong stand proud.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
