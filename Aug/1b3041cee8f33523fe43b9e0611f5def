Paris Saint-Germain’s sporting director, Leonardo, has revealed that Barcelona have only made one bid for Neymar and it came this week. The Spanish giants have been desperate to bring the Brazilian forward back to the Nou Camp this summer, but no deal has been agreed so far. Leonardo has now made it clear that there is still plenty to be done before Monday’s deadline, if Neymar is to make a surprising switch back to his former club. Speaking after PSG’s win over Metz on Friday night, he said: “Barcelona always knew what we wanted. “They submitted their first written offer on the August 27… We’ve never had a written agreement with Barcelona. “Today, there’s no deal. That’s the current situation.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
