Video Assistant Referee (VAR) might undergo changes to the way it judges offside calls. The UK Times reports that there will be a review, over whether it should only intervene if there is a clear error. The International FA Board (IFAB) will look into the VAR protocol and this will include the way it monitors offsides. FIFA and the governing bodies of the four home nations, will form the review panel, following a controversial opening weekend of the Premier League, which used VAR for the first time. The video technology system chalked off a third goal for Manchester City in their 5-0 win over West Ham United. Raheem Sterling’s shoulder was ruled to be offside by just mere millimetres before he squared a pass for Gabriel Jesus to score at the London Stadium. The same game also saw Sergio Aguero given the chance to retake a saved penalty, after VAR ruled encroachment from Declan Rice.
