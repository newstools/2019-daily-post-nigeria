The Adamawa State Police Command has apprehended a teenager for defiling a five-year-old girl and inflicting serious injury on her. The boy, 16-year-old Adamu Abdullahi, a resident of Jambutu in Yola North Local Government Area, is now being questioned by the police over the sexual assault on the child who was admitted for surgery at the Federal Medical Centre, Yola. The Adamawa State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Sulaiman Ngurore, who spoke to our correspondent on the incident and arrest of the suspect, hinted of persistent problem with parents not reporting rape cases. He said, “The family of the victim refused to report the case. it was when they realised the condition of the victim was bad and they could not manage it, that they took her to the hospital. “The attention of the police was drawn and they took her to the sexual assault referral centre (in the premises of the Specialist Hospital, Jimeta). When they found that she would need a surgical operation, they transferred her to the Federal Medical Centre where she was admitted. “The police deployed men and officials and we apprehended the suspect who is now helping us with investigation. We will charge him to court in due course.” According to the PPRO, Adamu Abdullahi used the opportunity of the downpour last Friday to pounce on the five-year-old and to cause her the damage that the FMC in Yola is now trying to repair.
