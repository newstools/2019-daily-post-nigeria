The Nigeria U 20 women’s team, the Falconets, on Thursday night beat Cameroon 3-2 on penalties to win the football gold at the ongoing African Games in Morocco. The win marks the third time Nigeria will clinch football gold in the women’s category after five editions. Nigeria and Cameroon were in the same group during the group stage and both sides settled for a 1-1 then. The tournament’s final clash between the two neighbouring countries was another feisty tie as the both teams battled each other for 120 minutes. But there was no goal to separate both sides. Chiamaka Nnadozie after her heroics at the World Cup with the Super Falcons in France proved to be a hero in Morocco as she saved three successive penalty kicks to help Nigeria to the gold. While it is the third gold medal for Nigeria, it is coming after a 12-year wait. Nigeria’s previous gold medal in women football at the African Games was in 2003 and 2007. While Cameroon won once in 2011 in Maputo, Mozambique. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
