The Ohanaeze Ndigbo has reacted to the reported attack on former Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu by suspected Biafra agitators. DAILY POST reports that the said attack occurred in far away Germany. Ekweremadu was dragged around and stoned with different objects, around the venue of the event. The lawmaker was later whisked away in a car, after several attempts to stop him from escaping. In the video, one of the attackers was heard saying “imagine, people are dying on a daily basis, people are wailing on a daily basis and we are here enjoying.” Reacting, Ohanaeze President-General, Chief John Nnia Nwodo described it as disappointing. His statement read: The assault on Ekweremadu by Igbos in Germany, described as IPOB, is disappointing, grotesque and dangerous for Igbo solidarity. This violent, rude, impertinent, divisive and discourteous style of IPOB or IPOB instigated miscreants is damaging to our cause. It strengthens the case of those who describe them as terrorists and weaken our case against the infringement of our fundamental human rights. Ekweremadu negotiated the sureties and securities for Nnamdi Kanu’s release on bail. He does not deserve this picketing and disgrace. A disgrace to him is a disgrace to Igbo race.
Whilst I condemn the attack on our revered son and leader, I call on the law enforcement agencies in Germany to bring to book the perpetrators of this despicable act. It is un-Igbo. It is disgraceful. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
