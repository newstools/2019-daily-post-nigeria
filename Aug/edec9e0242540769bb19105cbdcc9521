Former Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, was on Saturday disgraced by suspected members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). The incident is believed to have taken place in Nuremberg, Germany. Ekweremadu was dragged around and stoned with different objects, around the venue of the event. The lawmaker was later whisked away in a car, after several attempts to stop him from escaping. In the video, one of the attackers was heard saying “imagine, people are dying on a daily basis, people are wailing on a daily basis and we are here enjoying.”   Just In: Nigerians beat ex-deputy Senate president, #IkeEkweremadu, out of an event, today, in Germany A post shared by  Instablog9ja (@instablog9ja) on Aug 17, 2019 at 8:54am PDT  Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
