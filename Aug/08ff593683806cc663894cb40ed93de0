Coordinator of Usman Jibrin Campaign Organisation in Lokoja, the Kogi State capital, Alhaji Nagogo Maiyaki has disclosed on Tuesday that some delegates of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have been detained in Kogi State Board of Internal Revenue in Lokoja. He made the disclosure at a political gathering while hosting the gubernatorial aspirant and former Chief of Naval Staff, Jibrin Usman in Lokoja. Maiyaki explained that intimidation and harassment of party executives who were perceived not to be loyal to the governor have been heightened ahead of August 29 primaries. “As I speak, some of our delegates have been detained at the Board of Internal Revenue in Lokoja. “Yesterday, when I was going round to mobilise party executive for this event, I was informed that some of them were tricked to BIR and have been detained there.” In an interview after the event, the party chieftain said, the governor did not want any gubernatorial aspirant to access the APC party Executive before the primaries. He called on security agents to ensure the protection of party delegates and members, adding that it would be a shame for the party to keep losing members simply because they want to exercise their franchise.
