Marcus Rashford and Harry Maguire have condemned the racial abuse aimed at Paul Pogba on social media, after Manchester United’s draw with Wolves. Pogba was targeted after failing to score a penalty in the 1-1 draw at Molineux on Monday. Rashford, who had a seemingly amicable debate with Pogba beforehand over who would take the spot-kick, called on Twitter to take action against the culprits. “Enough now, this needs to stop Twitter. “Manchester United is a family. Paul Pogba is a huge part of that family. You attack him you attack us all,” he tweeted. Maguire also called on Twitter and Instagram to do more to prevent online abuse. “Disgusting. Social media need to do something about it… Every account that is opened should be verified by a passport/driving licence. Stop these pathetic trolls making numerous accounts to abuse people,” Maguire posted. United say they will take the “strongest course of action”, against any person found guilty of racial abuse and discrimination. “Everyone at Manchester United is disgusted by the racial abuse aimed at Paul Pogba last night and we utterly condemn it. “The individuals who expressed these views do not represent the values of our great club and it is encouraging to see the vast majority of our fans condemn this on social media also. “Manchester United has zero tolerance of any form of racism or discrimination and a long-standing commitment to campaigning against it through our #AllRedAllEqual initiative. “We will work to identify the few involved in these incidents and take the strongest course of action available to us. We also encourage social media companies to take action in these cases,” United said in a club statement.
