The Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Uyo has fixed September 10 for the adoption of written addresses by counsels of both the Peoples Democratic Party and the All Progressives Party in the petition filed by the APC Governorship candidate, Mr Nsima Ekere, challenging the re-election of Governor Udom Emmanuel. The tribunal announced this on Tuesday as the first, second and third respondents closed defense. Counsel to the Peoples Democratic Party, Tayo Oyetibo (SAN), after calling 11 witnesses, announced that he had closed his case for the 2nd Respondent. Also, counsel to the third respondent, INEC, Sylva Ogwemoh, (SAN) told the tribunal that having examined the case before the tribunal from the beginning, INEC no longer saw the need for additional witnesses. According to the INEC Counsel, “Based on the facts before tribunal, we have come to conclusion that there is nothing whatsoever to prove again by calling additional witnesses. “We have decided to align with the evidences made by the first and second respondents in this tribunal.” A total of 20 witnesses were called upon by the 1st respondent, while the 2nd respondent called 11 witnesses. In his remarks the Tribunal Chairman, Justice A. M. Yakubu, noted that the three-man panel enjoyed the cooperation of the Counsels, adding that the Tribunal was not surprised by the cooperation because of the capacity of the senior counsels involved. Yakubu said the position taken by the Counsel on final written address is good but for lack of time, he announced five days for filing of written addresses for both Petitioners and Respondents. He added that they have three days to file reply on point of law and adjourned to September 10, 2019 for adoption of the written addresses.
