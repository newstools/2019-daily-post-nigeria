Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has criticised Paul Pogba for playing ‘sloppy’ passes, during their 1-1 draw with Southampton at St Mary’s on Saturday. United took an early lead through Daniel James, but Jannik Vestergaard equalized in the second half. It looked as though Solskjaer’s men would go on to win after Kevin Danso was dismissed with 17 minutes left. But they failed to find anothr goals. Speaking after the game, Solskjaer admitted that Pogba created a few chances, but also acknowledged he wasn’t at his best during the first half. “I think we as a team after about half-an-hour started giving sloppy balls away and Paul was one of them. He wasn’t any different to anyone else. “We as a team didn’t play well but in the last 20 minutes or half-an-hour, he did create loads for us going forward. “Everyone expects everything from him every game, he has to defend, he has to attack, he has to win headers, he has to dribble past people, he has to make passes. “That’s just Paul and he’ll thrive on that,” he said. Pogba completed only 50/62 (81%) of his passes against Southampton, although he also created a match-high four chances.
