Former Super Eagles coach, Samson Siasia, on Saturday appealed for calm over the life ban imposed on him by FIFA. Siasia was banned by the world football governing for life, following a match-fixing probe. Speaking to newsmen in Abuja on Saturday through an associate, Prince Opukiri Jones-Ere, he said the matter was currently being looked into by his lawyer. “We want to please plead with everyone to be calm as the issue has been handed over to a lawyer and he is looking at the case. “So, at this moment, Siasia will be unavailable to speak to the press. “I want to also appeal to you all to be patient with us, considering the fact that he is already going through so much stress with regards to his mother’s kidnap which we are dealing with at the moment. “We appreciate you all for your concerns and solidarity messages which have been received from the onset of this situation. “So, my kind appeal is that you all give us some time for the lawyer to look into the case and as soon as possible, hopefully by next week, we will come up with our position and further action to be taken on the issue. “On behalf of the family of Siasia, we want to once again thank you for your concerns and we pray that this will end well,” he said.
