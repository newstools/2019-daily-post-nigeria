Burnley manager Sean Dyche has blamed officiating for his side’s 2-1 loss to Arsenal ib the Premier League on Saturday. Dyche was also critical of referee Mike Dean’s decision to award handball against Ben Mee in the build-up to Arsenal’s first goal. The defender was penalised for handling outside of the area and from the resulting free-kick, Lacazette worked the opening goal. The Clarets boss lamented Arsenal players diving and the rules surrounding simulation.. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang grabbed the winner in the second half after Ashley Barnes had cancelled out Alexander Lacazette’s opener. Speaking to BT Sports after the game, he said, “I’m really worried about the game of football. People falling on the floor, diving all over the place today has got to go. “I was at a Premier League meeting recently and did you know the maximum you can get is a yellow card? Every single player in the Premier League can cheat at least once. “So, I don’t think it’s going to stop, do you? I doubt it, unlikely I would suggest.” He added, “It’s a big decision, a wrong decision in my book. You can clearly see Ben Mee is trying to get his arm behind his back as far as he can,” Dyche explained after the match. “The lad kicks it up at him and he flinches. For me, that’s an impossible handball. I know there’s a lot of noise about silhouettes but I don’t know where he can put his arm. “That does inevitably lead to the goal. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want to cry about it, we could have cleared it, we had other chances to clear it but it is disappointing when you don’t get those decisions as it allows them another phase of attack.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
