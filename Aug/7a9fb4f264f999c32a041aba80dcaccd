Former Chelsea star, Joe Cole has singled out one player in Blues 3-2 win over Norwich City on Saturday. Nigerian-born Abraham scored twice for Chelsea in Saturday’s 3-2 win at Norwich. Cole tipped Abraham to build upon his first Blues goal. Abraham has come under pressure following three starts without a goal in the Chelsea team. The England U21 star failed to score against Manchester United, Liverpool FC and Leicester City and missed the key penalty in the shootout in the Super Cup. Abraham broke the deadlock within three minutes at Carrow Road before Todd Cantwell levelled for the hosts three minutes later. Chelsea FC restored their lead through Mason Mount but Norwich’s in-form striker, Teemu Pukki netted his fifth goal in three games to level the Premier League clash. Abraham gave Chelsea FC the advantage once more in the 68th minute with a brilliant finish from outside Tim Krul’s penalty area. Cole said that Abraham can hit the ground running after opening his Chelsea FC account. “I’m so pleased for Tammy,” Cole told BT Sport. “We were starting to talk about his goal record. Now he’s off the mark. He’ll be rocking and rolling.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
