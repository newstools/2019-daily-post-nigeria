The 2019 Action Democratic Party, ADP, presidential candidate, Sani Yabagi has berated President Muhammadu Buhari over the prosecutor of Abdullahi Babalele. Babalele, who is the son-in-law to Atiku Abubakar, 2019 presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, is being prosecuted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, for alleged money laundering. The Atiku’s son-inlaw, who was arraigned before a Federal High Court in Lagos State was, however, granted a N20m bail yesterday.  However, Yabagi said the prosecution of Babalele would create an impression that the Presidency was intimidating the opposition. Yabagi anchored his claim on the fact that Atiku was challenging the victory of President Buhari at the 2019 elections before the Presidential Election Petitions Tribunal. Featuring on Channels Television, Yabagi said: “I understand that Atiku’s lawyer and brother-in-law have been put behind bars by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the court. “That is not in tandem with what the political situation in the country is. It has a negative impact because we have not forgotten that Atiku is in court and people will think this is another way of intimidating the opposition. “So I think no matter what the case may be, in terms of what Atiku’s lawyer and the in-law must have done, I will expect that some decorum is exhibited because this is somebody that is in court with you. People will think you are trying to intimidate the opposition.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
