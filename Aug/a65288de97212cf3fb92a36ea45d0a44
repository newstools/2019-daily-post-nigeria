Former England striker, Michael Owen, is backing his former clubs Liverpool and Manchester United, to pick up three points in the Premier League this weekend. United will look to get back to winning ways when they host Crystal Palace on Saturday, while Liverpool clash with Arsenal at Anfield later in the day. Both the Reds and the Gunners have started the season with two wins out of two, but Owen believes Jurgen Klopp’s side will have enough to win. Speaking to BetVictor, Owen said: “United will still be rueing Paul Pogba ’s second-half penalty miss at Molineux on Monday evening, but I am confident Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side will return to winning ways against a Palace side who have yet to score so far this season. “United have genuine pace in their side and I believe they will have too much quality for an Eagles side who have created very little in their two games so far this term. “Something must give at Anfield on Saturday night as the only two sides with unblemished league records go head-to-head. “Despite their winning starts, neither team have been at the very top of their game so far this season, but the Reds have scored 22 goals in their last five home league games against the Gunners and I feel we will see plenty of opportunities at both ends. “Arsenal have not won their opening two league games of the season for a decade and I would be surprised if they were able to land the hat-trick with question marks remaining about the Gunners defensive capabilities. “It promises to be a fabulous game, but it is Liverpool to end the weekend top-of-the-table.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
