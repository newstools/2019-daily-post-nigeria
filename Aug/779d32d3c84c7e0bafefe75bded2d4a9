British boxer, Anthony Joshua, has claimed he lost to Andy Ruiz Jr in June, because of a “lucky punch”. Ruiz handed Joshua the first defeat of his professional career at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The Mexican dropped Joshua four times before the contest was stopped in the seventh round. The rematch is taking place on December 7th, and for the moment the location has been set down for Saudi Arabia. During his interview on AJ, The Untold Truth, Joshua explained how he lost to Ruiz. “By a lucky punch. By a punch sent by the gods. “I don’t know what concussion is, but for sure, after the fight I didn’t know what round (the fight was stopped). So I’m just shocked it took Ruiz Jr another four rounds to get me out. Let me concuss Ruiz Jr – he won’t get back up. “Ruiz Jr got hit by a flash knock-down – he was still raw, he wasn’t well-done, he wasn’t cooked yet. I should have left him a little bit longer. But the instinct in me was: ‘Boom!’ I ended up getting caught with a left hook on the top of the head. He ain’t that skilful. He’s a good fighter,” he said.
