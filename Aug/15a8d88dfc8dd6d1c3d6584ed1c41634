The National Assembly Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, on Friday dismissed the petition filed by the immediate past Senator in Oyo Central District, Monsurat Sunmonu and Chief Bisi Ilaka against the election of Senator Teslim Folarin of the All Progressive Congress (APC). Sunmonu, a former Speaker of the state House of Assembly and candidate of African Democratic Congress (ADC) and Ilaka who contested the election under the banner of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had gone to the Court to challenge Folarin’s emergence over what they termed as irregularities. But, while dismissing the petitions, the election petition panel chaired by D. M. Igyusu, in its judgement read by Sikiru Owodunni, unanimously agreed that both petitions lacked merit. They were of the opinion that none of petitioners was able to substantiate claims of over-voting and electoral malpractices, pleaded against Folarin’s victory. The court awarded cost of N20, 000 against the petitioners, in favour of all respondents, Folarin, Independent National Electoral Commission and the APC. Folarin, who is the Chairman, Senate Committee on Local contents, thanked God for the judgement and particularly thanked the judiciary for being the last hope of the common man. He eulogised members of his constituents for voting massively for him and was delighted that their decision to elect him has been affirmed by the court. He enjoined both petitioners to now respect the wish of the electorate and join hands in moving the district forward. But, counsel to both Sunmonu and Ilaka said they had their clients instructions to proceed on appeal against Folarin’s victory.
