Athletic Bilbao striker, Aritz Aduriz, has said he will always be available to help the club until the last day, after his stunning bicycle kick downed Barcelona 1-0 in the LaLiga opener. Aduriz plans to retire at season’s end, but the 38-year-old showed he still has plenty ability left, after netting an unforgettable 89th-minute winner on Friday. The Spanish striker, who played for the club three separate times throughout his career, has been with Athletic Bilbao since 2012 and has scored 172 goals in 391 games. He’s also featured for Real Valladolid, Mallorca and Valencia while earning 13 caps for Spain. Aduriz’s goal saw him match a Lionel Messi scoring feat, having now scored in 15 consecutive seasons in Spain’s top flight. “The team has been amazing. “There is no better way to start than by adding three points against Barca. “I said I was going to be there to help Athletic until the last day and today I have been able to prove it. “The atmosphere of San Mames is always insurmountable, but it is true that today people have taken this game even more eagerly. “Athletic’s base is young people. You have to give them confidence and go slowly with them. They will help us a lot throughout the year,” Aduriz told reporters.
