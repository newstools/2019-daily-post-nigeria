The United States Embassy in Nigeria has reacted to the decision of the Nigerian government to reduce visa application fee for Americans. In a statement sent to DAILY POST on Friday after an enquiry, the US said it would only act if the reduction was made official. It read: “The US Embassy looks forward to receiving official diplomatic communication regarding a new fee schedule for Americans seeking Nigerian visas. “Until such time, and confirmation of implementation, the reciprocity fees for approved visas to the United States will remain in place.” Nigeria government acted hours after the US said Nigerians will pay more for their visa application. US Consulate had explained that the increased cost was “reciprocating” the extra visa fee by the country. Aregbesola, Minister of Interior, on Wednesday directed the Comptroller-General of Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Muhammad Babandede, to act immediately. A statement by the ministry “acknowledged that there were engagements with the United States Embassy on the issue and in the aftermath, a Committee was set up to conduct due diligence in line with the Ministry’s extant policy on reciprocity of Visa fees “The Committee had concluded its assignment and submitted a Report but the issuance of authorisation for its recommendations was delayed due to transition processes in the Ministry at the policy level. “The Honourable Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola has approved the decrease of Visa charges payable by US citizens in line with reciprocity policy as recommended by the Committee.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
