A yet-to-be identified soldier from Alamala Barracks has just been reportedly killed in a fatal accident at Iyana Mortuary junction in Abeokuta, the Ogun state capital. DAILY POST reports that the soldier, who was riding on a bike, was knocked down by a truck loaded with granite. The driver of the truck was said to be coming from Idi Aba when he reportedly lost control and crossed to the other side, having a head-on collision with the soldier’s motorcycle. A police source told our correspondent that the driver ran away after realising that he had killed a soldier. The remains of the victim, DAILY POST learnt, had been taken away by the police. The truck, with a Lagos number plate, JJJ 833 XW, is still being towed out of the gutter as at the time of filing this report. The area has since been cordoned off by police and other security agents. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
