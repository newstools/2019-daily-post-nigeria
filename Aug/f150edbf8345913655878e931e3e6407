Senator Smart Adeyemi has said the emergence of Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State as the flag bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the November 16 governorship election, is the best option for the party. Adeyemi stated this in Lokoja, after the Governor Abubakar Badaru-election panel declared Bello as winner of Thursday’s primary. He also noted that it was not surprising Bello emerged with such huge margin among other nine aspirants. “Governor Yahaya Bello will win the general governorship elections in the same manner he won the primary. “Winning elections is not an internet affairs but acceptability by the people based on convictions by stakeholders across the political entity. “Governor Bello is a man of covenant with God, such people will not be confronted by men with mere wisdom. “Winning the November poll has become simpler with the governor holding the flag of the party in view of his sterling, first-term performance,” Adeyemi said.
