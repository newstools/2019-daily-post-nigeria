Paul Pogba will most likely not move to Real Madrid this year. ESPN reports that Manchester United will resist any bid for Pogba, during the remaining weeks of the European transfer window. The Red Devils have also received assurances from the player, that he is committed to the club this seeason. There is a possibility that Madrid could still launch a late move for Pogba, with LaLiga’s transfer deadline on September 2. However, United are set to reject any bid for Pogba, even if it surpasses their £180million demand, because there is no possibility of signing a replacement. Following the 4-0 win over Chelsea on Sunday, Pogba said there was still “a question mark” over his future. His latest comments came two months after the 26-year-old said publicly he wants a “new challenge.” Pogba is still keen on a move to Real Madrid, but there is an acceptance it will not happen this summer and he has assured manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer he is fully committed this season.
