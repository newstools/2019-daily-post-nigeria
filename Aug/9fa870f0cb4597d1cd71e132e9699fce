The University of Ibadan has lifted the ban on the activities of its Students’ Union Government, SUG, following a decision reached by the institution’s Senate. During the Senate meeting of August 30 (Friday), Dean of Students Affairs, Prof. I. A. Abiona, made a passionate appeal for the ban to be lifted to allow for the conduct of elections of the student body during the 2018/2019 session. This decision came two years after it was imposed. Recall that the Senate of the institution had in 2017 suspended students’ union activities until further notice following a protest over the delay in the issuance of digitised identity cards. In the proposal to lift the suspension, Abiona stated, “140 persons were tried in connection with the protest by the students’ disciplinary committee with some receiving sanctions while others were acquitted.” “The Student Affairs Division will ensure that a purposeful leadership of students emerges by raising the bar of eligibility, organisation of pre-election workshop and post-election leadership retreat for winners,” he assured.
