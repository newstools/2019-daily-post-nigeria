Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has disclosed that Midfielder Paul Pogba has become ‘stronger’ after he was subjected to racist abuse on social media. DAILY POST had reported that the France World Cup winner suffered racist abuses after missing his spot-kick in Man United’s 1-1 draw with Wolves in the Premier League last Monday at Molineux. Speaking on the development ahead of Man United’s Premier League clash against Crystal Palace on Saturday, Solskjaer told reporters at his pre-match press conference: “Paul’s fine, Paul’s a strong character. He’s a strong character and it makes him stronger. “When you speak to him he’s fine and I just cannot believe we’re still here in 2019 talking about these instances. “Social media is a place where people can hide behind fake identities, it’s not down to me to change it but there are so many Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on Twitter I know it’s not me. “We’ve got to do something about it and the authorities have got to do something about it. You feel sorry for [the abusers], they must have problems themselves.” Solskjaer added: “Sometimes you get annoyed, what can we do about it as Manchester United? We’re not going to ban our players on social media. “We have to spread the good word, we can use it to spread good and have to stop those incidents.” Recall that Man United had strongly condemned the racial abuse aimed at Pogba.
