Marcus Rashford was subjected to racist abuse on social media moments after missing a penalty during Manchester United 2-1 loss to Crystal Palace in the Premier League match on Saturday, according to Four Four Two. Chelsea forward, Tammy Abraham, Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba and Reading’s Yakou Meite have all been racially abused on Twitter in the past week after failing to score from the spot. In the build-up to the latest set of domestic games, Premier League managers put the focus on social media companies to monitor abuses dished out to players online. Representatives of Twitter are planning to meet with officials at Manchester United to discuss the racial abuse aimed at Pogba following his penalty miss against Wolves on Monday night. Anti-discrimination campaigners, Kick It Out and Twitter have been contacted for comment by the PA news agency following Saturday’s latest incident.
