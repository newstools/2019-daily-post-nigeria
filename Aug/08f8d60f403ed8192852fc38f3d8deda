Shehu Sani, immediate past Kaduna Central Senator, has condemned the attack on the former Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, in Nuremberg Germany. Senator Ekweremadu, who was attending the 2nd Annual Igbo Cultural Festival as a speaker and special guest of honour in an event organised by the Ndi-Igbo Germany community, was beaten up and publicly humiliated by suspected members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. Reacting, Sani condemned the attack. The former lawmaker noted that the agenda of those that attacked Ekweremadu cannot be achieved through violence or assault. Sani on his Twitter page wrote: “The attack on Senator Ekweremadu in Germany stands unreservedly condemned. “Whatever is the political or philosophical agenda of the people that attacked him, the strategy of physical assault or violence cannot lead them to success.” Meanwhile, the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB had owned up on the attack on the former Deputy Senate President. IPOB said the attack serves as a warning to Nnia Nwodo, Dave Umahi, Okezie Ikpeazu, Willie Obiano and others to stay away from any public event abroad unless they want to be humiliated.
