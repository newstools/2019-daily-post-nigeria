Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate Esther on Monday consoled Frodd following his nomination for possible eviction this Sunday. DAILY POST had reported that seven BBNaija housemates, including Mike, Seyi, Mercy, Diane , Frodd, Jackie and Gedoni have been selected for possible eviction this week. The housemates were nominated after the ‘Cruistopia team’ were defeated during the arena game challenge. Elozonam, who won the veto power on Sunday saved Venita and replaced him with Frodd from her team, ‘Cruistopia’. Frodd speaking to Esther after the nomination was upset that Elozonam replaced him with Venita. However, Esther consoling Frodd in the garden told him that he would scale through this week eviction and would stay in the house and watch Venita and Elozonam leave. According to her: “You are very strong Frodd, do not be bothered about who saved you or put you up for eviction. “I think Diane and Elozonam talked about his replacement this morning before the nomination challenge but don’t worry about it. “Don’t worry you will be in this house and see Elozonam and Venita leave.” VIDEO:   A post shared by BIG BROTHER NAIJA UPDATES (@bigbrothernaijaupdates_) on Aug 19, 2019 at 3:02pm PDT
