Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, has questioned the prices of goalkeepers and centre backs in today’s transfer market and claims he could be worth around €300million at the moment. Ronaldo became the world’s most expensive player, when he left Old Trafford for Real Madrid for £80m back in 2009. This summer, the Portugal superstar has seen Dutch youngster Matthijs de Ligt join him at Juventus for £67.5million this summer, while Lucas Hernandez switched Atletico Madrid for Bayern Munich for £70m. Virgil van Dijk set the benchmark when he moved to Liverpool for £75m last summer before Maguire broke the record with a £80m move to Manchester United. Liverpool also splashed £56m on Alisson with Chelsea spending over £70m on Kepa Arrizabalaga. Ronaldo feels players can now go for huge fees “even without showing anything”. “It’s difficult to make calculations in modern football. “[Clubs] gamble a lot on potential and the football industry is different. “Leaving the case of Joao Felix to the side, any player can go for 100 million euros, even without showing anything. “There is more money in football. “A centre back and a goalkeeper can go for 70 or 80 million euros. “I don’t agree [with it] but it’s the world that we live in and you have to respect it,” Ronaldo told Portuguese channel TV1. Ronaldo was pushed on how much he believes he would be worth in the current market, having joined Juventus for £88m just last summer. “When I see goalkeepers selling for 75 million euros, a player who does what I do on the pitch and who scores goals is worth three, four times more. easy,” he declared.
