Former Abia State Governor and the Senator representing Abia North district in the upper legislative chamber (Senate), Orji Uzor Kalu, has warned the northern political elites against clamouring an end to rotational presidency, insisting that the Igbo must take their turn in the number one seat (Presidency). Kalu, who is the current Chief Whip of the Nigerian Senate made his position known, Saturday, in Umuahia, while reacting to the call by the Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir el-Rufai, for an end to power shift in the country. The Senator opined that nobody should canvass an end to power shift until the South-East and the North-East geopolitical zones had produced the President of Nigeria. The APC Leader also explained that the agreement at the end of the 1978 national conference was that all the major ethnic groups in Nigeria must produce the President on a rotational basis. Kalu, “Calling for an end to the zoning arrangement now will not bring peace to Nigeria. We have to complete the zoning system. That was the agreement at the earlier constitutional conference. “All the major ethnic groups must produce the President before we would all agree that zoning has ended”.
