Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has said that Sadio Mane’s angry reaction on the bench at Burnley, wasn’t down to the fact that he had just been substituted. Mane was taken off for Divock Origi, shortly after failing to receive a pass from Mohamed Salah when the score was 3-0. When he was taken off, the Senegal forward could be seen walking past Klopp and shouting at a member of Liverpool’s staff on the bench. He was then comforted by fellow goalscorer Roberto Firmino, who had also just been replaced. “Sadio Mane is an emotional guy, we are all individuals. “Something went not like he wanted, it is not the substitution. We will clarify it in the dressing room,” Klopp told Sky Sports. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
