Ex-international, Kanu Nwankwo, on Thursday, met with Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State. Nwankwo told newsmen in Ibadan after the meeting that he visited the Governor to solicit support for 200 patients awaiting surgical operations through the Kanu Heart Foundation, NAN reports. “Nigerian football is not bad, but can do better. I believe football is growing in terms of the league. “There used to be times when people don’t go to the stadium to watch games. “There is still room to improve in every angle. For me, what I did was to go back to the grassroots which is the most important,” he said. Nwankwo said he was in Ibadan to solicit support for 200 patients awaiting surgical operation through his foundation, adding that he could not do it alone. He said his heart foundation had since establishment sponsored 561 surgical operations. “We have 200 on the waiting list and Kanu alone cannot do it. That is why I have been moving from one governor to the other to solicit support. “I pray they respond by coming to our aid. We are also planning to build our hospital in Nigeria because we are tired of taking them out of the country every time. It is all about sacrifice,” he added.
