Former Manchester United defender, Gary Neville has predicted that Midfielder Paul Pogba can still be the Premier League Best Player of the Year this season despite missing a penalty in the Red Devils’ 1-1 draw with Wolves at Molineux on Monday. Anthony Martial’s first-half goal was cancelled out by Ruben Neves after the break. Man United had the chance to take all three points after the referee awarded a penalty. Pogba stepped up after discussing with Rashford and saw his kick saved by Rui Patricio. But Neville now believes that the France World Cup winner has the potential to be the best player in the English top-flight league this term, adding that the former Juventus star has the biggest personality. “I think Pogba could be the player of the year. That sounds like a bold statement,” Neville told Sky Sports. “He has the potential to be the best player in this league. He has the biggest personality in this league. “Manchester United’s season rests a lot on him depending on how well he plays. I think he could be the player of the year, he is the one to watch for me. “A lot of success for United depends on him and whether he can reach his real high standard.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
