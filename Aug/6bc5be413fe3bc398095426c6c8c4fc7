Liverpool are set to land a major windfall, as a result of Philippe Coutinho’s move to Bayern Munich, according to Sport. Coutinho is close to completing a loan switch to the German giants, after Barcelona confirmed a deal has been agreed. The loan move with an option to buy will see Liverpool receive the full €20m (£18m) loan fee. This is as a result of money they are still owed by Barcelona for the purchase of the Brazilian. Coutinho moved to Barca back in January 2018, after five years at Anfield in a deal worth a total of £142million. But it included a number of clauses and it is reported Coutinho’s premature departure from the club after a tough 18 months, will see the Reds land an extra chunk of the fee.
