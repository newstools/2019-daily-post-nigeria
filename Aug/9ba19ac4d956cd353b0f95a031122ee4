Barcelona midfielder, Ivan Rakitic, has been deemed surplus to requirements at the club, AS reports. The 31-year-old was left on the bench for the entire 90 minutes of their 5-2 win over Real Betis on Sunday. Rakitic was limited to just 45 minutes the previous week, when they lost 1-0 at Athletic Bilbao. The Croatia international still has two years left on his contract with the Spanish champions, but Barca have decided they would be willing to let him leave this summer if a bid came in for him. The player has been offered to Paris Saint-Germain, as part of a bid to bring Neymar back. But the French club rejected the offer, as they are looking to squeeze out more cash from any potential buyer.
