The Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Winifred Oyo-Ita, has revealed why she returned to work, after questioning by the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) over an alleged N3bn fraud. The Nation reports that Oyo-Ita informally told staff close to her, that President Muhammadu Buhari asked her to come back to the office. It was earlier speculated that she had resigned from her role, after so much pressure from the EFCC and the Presidency. The rumour was fuelled by her absence at the two-day retreat for the newly inaugurated ministers. However, DAILY POST reports Oyo-Ita was at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, to witness the swearing-in of Ministers-designate on Thursday. Oyo-Ita, who arrived shortly before the commencement of the inauguration of the ministers by the president, was seen heading towards the office of the Chief of Staff to the President, Malam Abba Kyari.
