Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has suggested why the zoning arrangement for the 2023 presidential election may not work in the All Progressives Congress, APC. Ganduje stated that the zoning arrangement for the 2023 presidential election was still in the realm of “realism and idealism”. He said this while reacting to El-Rufai’s call for the abolition of zoning formula for the presidency. Addressing journalists in Abuja yesterday, Ganduje said: “About the zoning issue, which was triggered by the governor of Kaduna State, it is an issue between realism and idealism. Idealism is a situation whereby things should be according to ideal, and, if things are according to ideal, then everybody has equal opportunity, equal chance to contest and then whatever the people decide would triumph. That is idealism. “Now, the issue of realism, Nigeria is multi-tribal and that is why we have geopolitical zones, that is why we have, even during the colonial time, North and South, but now we have states and geopolitical zones. So, in reality, people are yearning for participation from different geopolitical zones: North and South. That is still in our mind. “The reality of the situation is that people are clamouring (over) marginalisation in the leadership of the country but the idealism is that people should participate and be elected based on their capacity and capability. “So, it is not the governor of Kano State that would decide whether it would be idealism or realism. It is the party that would determine which theory should be applied in Nigeria. Politics is a game of numbers. So, the political party should decide which one to follow.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
