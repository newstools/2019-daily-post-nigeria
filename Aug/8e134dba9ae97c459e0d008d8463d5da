Arsenal manager, Unai Emery has said he would make late calls on the fitness of Mesut Ozil and Granit Xhaka, ahead of their trip to Liverpool. The Gunners take on Jurgen Klopp’s men on Saturday with both teams still boasting of a 100 per cent start to the new Premier League season. Ozil has not featured at all this campaign because of security issues. Xhaka missed last weekend’s 2-1 win over Burnley with a back issues. However, both players are back in full training with the rest of the squad. “We will assess them tomorrow. Today they trained but I need tomorrow to have the last training. “I’m positive with some players, but I don’t want to decide today or say to you today because tomorrow things may change,” Emery told the media on Thursday.
