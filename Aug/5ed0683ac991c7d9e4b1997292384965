Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodgers, has said Frank Lampard is the “perfect” manager to take Chelsea forward, despite a rough start that has seen the Blues lost two matches to their Premier League rivals. Lampard has lost his opening two competitive matches in charge of the Blues, going down 4-0 at Manchester United in the Premier League, before Tammy Abraham’s shoot-out miss saw Liverpool edge the UEFA Super Cup. The Blues welcome Leicester City who drew 0-0 with Wolves in their opening outing to Stamford Bridge, in Lampard’s first home match on Sunday. Despite a difficult start, Rodgers believes the former Derby County boss is an ideal fit for Chelsea. “I think Frank has done very well since he has gone in. “This is a team that finished third and won the Europa League. I think Frank is perfect for it. He and Jody [Morris], they understand the fabric of Chelsea, what it’s about. “You go with your gut feeling. He’s been around a long time. He understands the club, the expectancy. “He’s a hero for the supporters. He’ll want to win and succeed as a manager. He’s got great staff around him who also understand Chelsea and then he’ll have that support,” Rodgers, a former Chelsea youth coach, told a news conference on Friday.
