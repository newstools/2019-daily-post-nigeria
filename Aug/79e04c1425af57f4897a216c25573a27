Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona have set the price for Neymar at €170million, ESPN reports. However, the details about payments are holding up the deal. PSG want the entire amount to be paid up front, but Barca are exploring different ways to cover the fee, following a busy summer in which they brought in Antoine Griezmann, Frenkie De Jong, Neto and Junior Firpo for a combined €239million. During a meeting between the two sides on Tuesday, Barcelona offered to pay €40million in 2019, with additional payments of €65million to be made in 2020 and 2021. But the Ligue 1 side rejected that proposal and insisted that they want the entire fee paid up front. The Spanish champions are now looking to include Ousmane Dembele as a makeweight in the deal.

Barcelona technical secretary, Javier Bordas, said after the meetings that the club “felt closer to a deal than in days past.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
