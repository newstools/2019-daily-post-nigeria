Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemates: Esther and Venita, Tuesday morning counseled Mike over his attitude to other housemates. Mike, who seems to be ‘the jolly one’ in the BBNaija show, on Tuesday caused a stir in the house. DAILY POST had reported that an altercation broke out Tuesday morning between Mike and Tacha at the gym. The argument started when Tacha warned Mike to stop cheering her at the gym but he continued. This led to a quarrel with some housemates taking sides and others trying to calm the situation. Tacha, who was upset that Mike refused to listen to her, ‘rained’ insults on him. She said, ”You don’t want to have sense, you carried ‘busy-body’ from secondary school to Big Brother House.I have been saying the same thing every time. Keep your freaking encouragement to yourself, I don’t want it.” But Mike, in reaction, maintained that there was nothing wrong in cheering Tacha. Some housemates found Mike’s action in the house uncomfortable as they warned him against infringing on other people’s opinions and decisions. Esther, while speaking to Mike, said: “You need to respect other people’s decision. You know Tacha does not like people cheering her let her be next time, please.” Likewise, Venita warned Mike to stay off other BBnaija housemates’ lane despite his cheerful attitude of always wanting to uplift others. DAILY POST recalls that Seyi during rehearsal for a challenge given to them by Biggie last week, had an argument with Mike which did not go down well with other housemates. Mike confronted Seyi, urging him to act like a leader and stop being ‘hypersensitive’. They, however, reconciled as Seyi apologized to Mike and his team members for his lackadaisical attitude.
