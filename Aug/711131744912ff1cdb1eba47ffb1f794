Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has blamed his players for their 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace on Saturday in the Premier League. The Norwegian said Man United lost to Crystal Palace because his players were not clinical enough in front of goal. Goals from Jordan Ayew and Patrick van Aanholt gave the visitors all three points against Man United. However, Daniel James did score a goal for Solskjaer’s men as Marcus Rashford missed his spot-kick during the encounter. Solskjaer told Match of the Day: “They scored 2 and we scored only one. “We just were not clinical enough in front of goal and they scored two very easy goals. “I thought we got our act together second half, we just couldn’t hit the target. “We have dominated the game but we have not controlled it.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
