The Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, on Tuesday, reacted to President Muhammadu Buhari’s termination of Rev. Tor Ujah’s appointment as the Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Christian Pilgrim Commission (NCPC). According to the government, Ujah’s sack is in line with the provision of Section 4, Sub-Section 3 of the NCPC Act. In a reaction, CAN’s National Director of Legal and Public Affair, Evangelist Samuel Kwamkur, said in an exclusive chat with DAILY POST in Abuja that the umbrella Christian body had no objection to the decision of the President since he exercised his legal rights as entrenched in the NCPC Act. He, however, urged the President to appoint, as Ujah’s replacement, a substantive Executive Secretary, who would prioritise service while closing the gap between Church and government. Kwamkur said, “We cannot tell the government that it must appoint this person or remove that individual as the NCPC boss. “But we can always give our opinion as to our desire that good people be appointed to lead the Commission; people that are ready to serve because some people see the NCPC as a money making point. “Such people rather than helping the Church to grow and Christians to build their faith as they visit the Holy Land by creating programmes that will bring the Church together or closer to government; they increase the gap so that the church will be far from the government. That’s the unfortunate part we have seen some leaders bin such capacities play.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
