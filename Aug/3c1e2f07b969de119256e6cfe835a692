The priest in charge of St Joseph Catholic Church, Achina, Rev. Fr. Vincent Nwokoye, on Wednesday, led residents of the area to a protest to draw government’s attention over the deplorable condition of roads in most communities in Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State. The priest warned that if nothing urgent was done, the area would be eaten up by erosion. He called for the immediate intervention of the Federal and State governments on roads Achina, Onneh, Agbudu, Umuomaku, Ogboji and Enugwu-Umuonyia communities. He said the roads were on the verge of being pulled down. He said, “The erosion is so much that it is gradually encroaching into the church’s property, including the primary school and the parsonage. Attendance to church services has also reduced drastically following the impassable condition of the road.” One of protesters who spoke to reporters, Otitochi Okeke, “The Achina-Onneh-Agbudu-Ogboji road which was awarded by your administration in 2014 is in a very deplorable state, with gullies developing at various points. “Also, the Ezira-Umuomaku-Enugwu-Umuonyia-Achina road which you flagged off in 2015 is in dire need of attention as no work is ongoing at the site.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
