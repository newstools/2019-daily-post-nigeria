Meanwhile, speaking ahead of the encounter, Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane had described Gareth Bale as an ‘important player’ in his squad. “It seemed Bale was leaving and now he’s here with us. The dynamics and things change, but I will count on him, Zidane was quoted by Real Madrid’s official website as saying on Friday in his pre-match press conference. “He has a good record and is an important player and I hope that all the players want to make it difficult for me to pick the team.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
