Tottenham Hotspur top attacker, Heung-Min Son has reacted to his side’s Premier League 1-0 defeat to Newcastle United on Sunday. Son blamed Mauricio Pochettino’s men for not being clinical enough in front of goal against Newcastle despite having a lot of chances during the encounter. Newcastle’s club record signing, Joelinton scored the only goal of the match in the 27th minute following an assist from Christian Atsu to give the visitors all three points against Mauricio Pochettino’s side “The goals were missing today. We had plenty of chances but we were not clinical enough,” Son was quoted as saying by the BBC Sport after the match. “It’s always hard against teams that play deep, it makes it more difficult. “I think we had chances to score, we should have got something out of this game. “We have only played three games, there is a long way to go. “This was not the best result but we have to stay positive and go again.” Tottenham will now take on Arsenal in their next Premier League fixture on September 1.
