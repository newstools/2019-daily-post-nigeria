Chelsea hero, Glen Johnson has made his Premier League prediction for the top four after a difficult start for new manager Frank Lampard, at Stamford Bridge. The Blues will play their first home match of the season against Leicester City on Sunday.
Johnson backs Frank Lampard-led Chelsea to maintain a place in the top four this season. Johnson, who was part of the first Chelsea team to win the Premier League under Jose Mourinho, expects the Blues to get better and better under Lampard. “It’s been a tough start to life back at Chelsea for my old team-mate Frank Lampard, but I think the heavy defeat at Old Trafford might be what was needed as a wake-up call for him and the team to realise the scale of the job they face,” Johnson told BETDAQ. “Despite not getting the result they wanted, it was a much better performance against Liverpool in the Super Cup. “I don’t think Frank will be too tough on his squad as he knows he must keep them onside and get performances out of them. “I’m confident he can get things right there in the long run. He’s a strong character, and I still fancy them to reach the top four this season which, all things considered, would be an amazing achievement for them. “Frank faces my old boss Brendan Rodgers [Leicester City boss] this weekend and, while I’m backing Chelsea for this one, I expect Brendan to do well for Leicester this season. “Brendan’s training methods and the way he prepares teams for a match is very similar to Jose Mourinho. “Their teams might have a different style of play, but there are still comparisons there. “I’ve heard people say Leicester can break into the top six this season, which will be tough but if anyone can do it then they can.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
