Big Brother Naija housemate, Cindy, on Sunday lamented to Biggie about her fellow housemate, Omashola. Omashola and Cindy were on Saturday paired for their Munch it challenge, which had Mercy and Ike emerge winners. Cindy speaking to Biggie during her diary session, said she would never want to be paired with Omashola because he was authoritative and wanted to be in charge despite his ‘ridiculous ideas’. She added that Omashola was disrespectful to her. “Working with Omashola yesterday was difficult, his ideas are ridiculous. I was trying to correct him but it was not successful. “If I have an opportunity to pick a partner, I would pick another partner.” When asked on her relationship with housemates, Cindy said she is not bothered about comments from housemates about her. According to her, she can only be friends with Khafi outside the house because she has things in common with her. “I’ve not found that person I can connect to except Khafi in the house. Some of them behave somehow sometimes and query my attitude but I’m just being myself. “I and Khafi have a lot of things in common and I can be genuine friends with her outside the house. “I’m not bothered about what housemates say about me in the house,” Cindy added.
