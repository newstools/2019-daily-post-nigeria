The umbrella body of all civil society groups in Nigeria, the Coalition of Civil Society Organizations of Nigeria (COSCON), has called on the federal government to ensure all the soldiers who participated in the gruesome murder of three special police anti-Kidnapping team in Taraba state recently are prosecuted with the Captain that directed them to kill the victims. The Director of Programme of the Coalition, Mr. Edomobi Promise, in a terse statement made available to newsmen, Wednesday, expressed dismay at the incident, noting that it was now clear that many security agents in Nigeria were trained killers of innocent people and collaborators with criminals. He said, “Imagine the killing of Okada man at Aba over One Hundred Naiira bribe, the killing in all parts of Nigeria by security agents over flimsy reasons. Nigerians should rise up and say NO to the Extra-Judicial killings and brutality by security agents in Nigeria. “We warn that the Killer soldiers in Aba should not be shielded nor the kidnapper they
sought to protect. The military deliberately carried out the alleged killings. Our stand is that let justice prevail”. DAILY POST had reported that Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, last week, said that the armed security personnel, who allegedly shot and killed a commercial motorcyclist in a community near Aba, had been arrested. The deceased, Mr Chimaobi Uzoukwa, was reportedly killed for refusing to part with N100 bribe at Ohanze Obingwa military checkpoint.
