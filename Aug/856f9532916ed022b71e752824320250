Leader of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, has refused treatment from those he called unknown doctors put in place to treat him in India. The Shiites leader is insisting that he wants to be treated by those booked to treat him before he and his wife left from Nigeria. A member of the Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) made the disclosure to PRNigeria anonymously on Wednesday. He lamented about the attitude of Indian government. The top official said the country was acting as though El-Zakzaky was a common criminal even when no court in Nigeria had convicted him. The source further disclosed that the Indian government has given El-Zakzaky deadline to leave if he refuses to receive treatment from doctors available to treat him who had been cleared by their government. “I just received a very worrying news from the Indian government that ultimatum has been given to the Leader of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria to leave India if he does not agree to the Doctors specified to treat him. “From the way this is going, he is being treated extremely bad”, the IHRC representative said. “Under the current situation, it seems he has no choice other than to go back to Nigeria. He has been given some hours to respond to their ultimatum. “This is to me is totally, utterly unacceptable by any standard, either international standards or Indian standards or that of humanity”, the IHRC top official said. He further noted that “This is a man that has not been found guilty of anything to the extent that in his own country, the highest court has granted him permission that he should be treated. “The Indian government by their behaviour depicts Sheikh El-Zakzaky as a criminal. This is really outrageous and those who stand for justice should please respond.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
