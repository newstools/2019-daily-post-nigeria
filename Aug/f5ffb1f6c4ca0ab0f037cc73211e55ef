The Enugu State Government has condemned in its entirety, the alleged murder of a woman in a farmland at Nchatancha community in Emene, Enugu East Local Government Area. In a statement by the Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Simon Ortuanya, the government condoled with the family of the deceased and charged the security agencies to commence a full scale investigation into the unfortunate incident with a view to apprehending and prosecuting the culprits. Consequently the state governor, Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, has directed Chairmen of the 17 Local Government Areas, who are yet to mount Vigilante security checkpoints in their respective areas to do so within two weeks, to ensure adequate security operations in their localities. The statement by Prof. Ortuanya added the state government “deeply appreciates the good people of the state for their cooperation and support” and reassured them that “we are winning the war against criminality”. DAILY POST recalls that suspected Fulani herdsmen had struck again in Enugu killing a woman identified as Mrs. Pat Ngwu. A source said the woman was abducted from her farmland in Nchatancha community, Emene, raped and murdered. Her corpse was later found in a nearby river.
