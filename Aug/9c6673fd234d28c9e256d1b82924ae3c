The Imo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has accused the state Governor, Emeka Ihedioha of witch-hunt. Chairman of the state chapter of the party, Daniel Nwafor claimed that the Ihedioha-led government was on a witch-hunt and vendetta mission. In a statement he signed, Nwafor stressed that some of Ihedioha’s actions indicated that he was not prepared for governance, only out for vendetta. According to Nwafor: “All we have seen in the last two months is vindictiveness and a desperate attempt to demonise the previous administration. “It has become obvious that they are not there for the people. Government is a continuous process. they should sustain the achievements of the previous government. trying to erase the legacies of the former administration does not help in anyway. “The PDP administration is confused. what they are doing is the reverse of their campaign promises. Imo is becoming unsafe, workers are complaining, people are scared to invest in the state, the interim government should get to work, while we await the outcome of the court. “This is nearly hundred days in office and there is nothing to point at, except maligning and pursuing after former governor Rochas Okorocha”.
