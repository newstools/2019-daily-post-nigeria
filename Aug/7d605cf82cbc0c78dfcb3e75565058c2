Big Brother Naija housemate, Tacha and Mike on Tuesday morning engaged in war of words. The argument broke out after Tacha warned Mike to stop cheering her at the gym but he continued. This led to a serious argument with some housemates taking sides and others trying to calm the situation. Tacha who was upset that Mike refused to listen to her ‘rained’ insults at him. She said, ”You don’t want to have sense, you carried ‘busy-body’ from secondary school to Big Brother House. ”I have been saying the same thing every time. Keep your freaking encouragement to yourself, I don’t want it,” she added. But, Mike in reaction, maintained that there was nothing wrong in cheering Tacha. According to him, cheering is a way of showing team spirit. DAILY POST had last month reported that following the return of Tacha and Seyi into the house, Mike had lamented Tacha’s attitude. Mike said he never liked Tacha’s energy while she was in the house, adding that other housemates also felt happy when she left. “Tacha, I’m going to keep it hundred with you. “Before you left, I didn’t like your energy, and when you left, I felt elated, even the house could agree,” he said.   Tacha is mad at Mike for Cheering her up during gym sessions,(she doesnt want anyone cheering her up during gym sessions)and that she doesnt want it _________________________ Follow @bbnaija2019gists for latest pepper gists on the ongoing big brother naija 2019 . . . . . . . . . . . . #bbnaija2019 #bbn2019 #pepperdem #instablog9ja #tundeednut #bigbrotherupdates #bigbrothernaijatea #bb9ja #pepperdem #naijaeverything #ijeomadaisy #olorisupergal #teamseyiawolowo #teammike #symplytach #bet9ja #bbnaija2019gists #bbnaija2019hotgists #teamkhafi #gotv #teammercy #teamtacha #airreys #teamOmashola A post shared by  #BBNaija2019 #pepperdem (@bbnaija2019gists) on Aug 20, 2019 at 12:48am PDT  Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
