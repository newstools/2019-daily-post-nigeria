Political parties under the umbrella of Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) on Friday staged a walkout on a function organized by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) allaying the fear that they no longer have confidence in the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Prof. James Apam ahead of the November 16th governorship election in Kogi State. Speaking on behalf of IPAC at the INEC headquarter in Lokoja, Comrade Ibrahim Itodo alleged that the present REC has been dancing to the tune of the APC government in Kogi State. He further alleged that the REC while doing the bidding of the State government made the Kogi State Government House his second home. Itodo who could not hide his displeasure on the REC accused him of fraudulent engagement. ” We have lost confidence in the present REC and we will no longer take on the processes of the election in the State until the REC is removed. We, the political parties because of the loss of confidence will not have any engagement forthwith on the November 16th governorship election.” This is a signal to professor Mamood Yakubu to effect a change because he is not the only one. The issues against the REC are fraudulent engagement and romance with the government. “He sleeps in the Government House and does not have regards to the question that are raised by stakeholders. When issues are raised before the REC, he will respond by saying go and produce your evidence. That is not the way to handle political parties who are critical stakeholders during election,” he added. When contacted, the embattled Resident Electoral Commissioner in Kogi State, Prof James Apam told DAILY POST that he won’t comment on the matter
saying, ” I remain unshaken in doing my work in the State.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
