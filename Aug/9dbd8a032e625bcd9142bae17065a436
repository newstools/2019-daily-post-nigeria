JESUS!! JESUS!!!” and with a speed of about 100km/H or there about, we rammed right into the back of this truck. ”God being so merciful and wonderful, we got off with very minor injuries. ”How the tail of the truck was stopped from causing major damage on us is just God’s doing. ”God, I thank you for life, I thank You for Your Mercies , I thank You for Your Grace and for your love on sinners like us. ” your name be glorified forever in Jesus Mighty Name!!!
