Liverpool have allowed defender Dejan Lovren to move to Roma in a £23million deal, according to Calcio Mercato. Lovren is close to completing the deal that will see him leave Anfield after being demoted to the Reds’ fourth choice centre-back. Jurgen Klopp has placed Virgil van Dijk, Joe Gomez and Joel Matip firmly ahead of Lovren in his pecking order at Anfield. According to the Italian publication, the two clubs have almost concluded an agreement worth up to £23m when add-ons are included. The Croatian international has made 170 appearances for Liverpool having joined in a £20m move from Southampton in 2014. Injuries and the strong performances of Matip, Van Dijk and Gomez saw the Croatian limited to just 18 appearances in all competitions last season. He is yet to make a first-team appearance this season for the Reds after being left out of Klopp’s squad for the league opener against Norwich and Wednesday’s UEFA Super Cup.
