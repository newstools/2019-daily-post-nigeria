A cross section of Nigerians have reacted to the passionate kiss shared between Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemates, Frodd and Esther. This is as Esther on Wednesday night suddenly kissed Frodd. Esther, who had severally turned down Frodd, kissed him during their presentation on Wednesday. DAILY POST recalls that Esther had earlier turned down Frodd’s proposal which pushed him to tears. Big Brother had also warned Frodd for attempting to touch Esther against her will on Saturday night. Esther’s kiss has since stirred reactions from Nigerians on social media, who took her move towards Frodd as a strategy to gain votes from viewers to avoid eviction on Sunday.
