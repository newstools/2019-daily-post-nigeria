Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp has said that Arsenal can challenge for the Premier League title this season after signing ‘amazing’ players. Nicolas Pepe, Dani Ceballos, Kieran Tierney and David Luiz all arrived at the Emirates this summer following a season in which the Gunners finished fifth, 27 points behind runners-up, Liverpool. Arsenal are one of only two teams to boast of a perfect start to the 2019-20 campaign and face fellow unbeaten Liverpool at Anfield. Speaking in Liverpool’s official matchday programme ahead of the clash, Klopp said of Arsenal: “They have recruited amazing talent this summer. “It’s one of the reasons why I haven’t liked the ‘external’ focus in pre-season being on just a couple of clubs contesting for honours this season. “To me this made no sense at all. It’s a complete nonsense if you don’t view this Arsenal, with this manager, as being one of the best teams in the country. “They have everything required to go the distance and I think it’s why we are in for such an exciting season in the Premier League. “The good news for me and the staff here at Liverpool is that our players do not need reminding today that they face a world-class opponent.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
