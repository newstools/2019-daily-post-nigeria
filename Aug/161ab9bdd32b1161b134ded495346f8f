Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard has confirmed that N’Golo Kante, Toni Rudiger and Pedro will miss the Blues’ Premier League clash against Sheffield United at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. According to him, Kante and Pedro are not fit, while Rudiger will feature for Chelsea’s Under 23 squad tonight. “N’Golo Kante is not fit. It’s a continuation of his ankle problem. He won’t be traveling with the French squad either,” Lampard told Chelsea’s official website on Friday. “I had a conversation with Didier Deschamps and we both agreed it was the best thing for him, so let’s try and get him fit over the break. “Of course it’s a setback, but my focus is on making sure Kante is okay. He’s had four years of constant football at an incredibly high level, energy level, output level. We certainly have to get it right. “We have a strong squad with strong numbers in midfield. The midfield performance last week was very good. We have a strong squad and we have to show it. “Pedro is not fit. Hopefully he should be fit the other side of the international break as well. “Rudiger is going to play for the Under-23s tonight, hopefully for the final time in terms of getting proper match fitness. Then he is in serious contention to play after the break.” Chelsea head to the game following 3-2 victory over Norwich City last weekend. The kick-off time for the match is 3 pm.
