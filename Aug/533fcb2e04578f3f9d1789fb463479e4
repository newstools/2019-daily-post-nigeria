Spanish side, CD Leganes have confirmed the signing of Super Eagles defender Chidozie Awaziem. Awaziem joined the La Liga side on a season-long loan from Porto.

The versatile player joined Porto in the 2014-15 season from local club Junior Elkanemi and has played 15 games for their first team, scoring one goal. The 22-year-old signed for Leganes after a recent loan spell at Turkish side, çaykur Rizespor, for whom he made 16 appearances in the second half of the 2018-2019 campaign. He made his Champions League debut for Porto in a 3-2 win at Galatasaray in December 2018. Awaziem will wear the number 12 jersey in LaLiga this season. He is the second Nigeria international defender to join Leganes in the summer transfer window after Kenneth Omeruo.
