The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB, has disclosed the result cancellation of another candidate of the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, UTME. JAMB said the candidate, Kingsley Unekwe’s result was canceled because he altered his score. Addressing reporters on Friday in Abuja, JAMB Registrar, Prof. Is-haq Oloyede said 18-year-old Unekwe was caught inflating his original UTME score from 201 to 269. Oloyede said the discovery was made when Unekwe and his mother appeared before some officials of the board in Abuja. The JAMB Registrar also disclosed that the boy would be handed over to security agencies for prosecution. According to Oloyede: “Anybody who does post-result infraction will have their results withdrawn by the board. “You are the fifth person. Two of them are already being prosecuted because we showed them clearly that they forged their results to deceive their parents who are desperate like your parents are to study medicine. “We will prosecute you for attempting to damage the image of the board. We told your father that we have all the facts, if we find out that the facts are not correct you will be prosecuted.” The 18-year-old becomes the fifth person whose UTME result was withdrawn and canceled by the board. Oloyede said the boy edited the original score allocated to him by the board and presented it to his parents as the original result, adding that Unekwe’s parent had called the board, alleging irregularities in their son’s result.
