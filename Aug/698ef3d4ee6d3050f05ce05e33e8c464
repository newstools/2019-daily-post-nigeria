Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has identified Nicolas Pepe and Granit Xhaka as the two key players Arsenal boss, Unai will start against his side when both teams clash in Saturday’s Premier League clash at Anfield. Klopp expects Emery to play Pepe alongside Xhaka against the UEFA Champions League winners. “Arsenal will probably change two key positions, probably Pepe will start, which will not make them weaker, and Xhaka probably,’ Klopp said in his press conference on Friday. “I can’t see many other changes. “What has happened a lot to us in the last few months or maybe years, when you’re analysing [the opposition], especially in the early stages, then they play completely different, playing build-up against everybody but not against us. “I’m not saying Arsenal do this but it makes life analysing quite tricky, especially in the early stages of the season. “I have no idea how [they will play against us], I know what they did in their first two games, I know what they did against us last year. “But I don’t know more, so we have to make a couple of decisions that makes us kind of independent of what they do.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
