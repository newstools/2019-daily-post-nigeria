Real Madrid have changed their stance on the future of James Rodriguez, according to Deportes COPE. A few European clubs were keen on taking the Colombian playmaker this summer, but his “situation at Real Madrid has changed”. It was believed Zidane wanted Rodriguez and Gareth Bale to leave the club, so he could bring in Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba. However, Rodriguez has now been taken off the market. The 28-year-old provided seven goals and six assists on loan at Bayern Munich last season, lifting the German Cup and Bundesliga trophy. He will now stay with the Spanish giants ahead of the new LaLiga season. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
