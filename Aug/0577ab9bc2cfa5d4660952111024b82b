Arsenal manager, Unai Emery has hinted that Nacho Monreal will leave the club in the coming days. Monreal started for the Gunners as they lost 3-1 to Liverpool in Saturday’s late kick-off in the Premier League. However, he might be gone by the time Emery picks his squad for next week’s North London Derby at the Emirates. “He made a very big match, he’s a big professional for us. We need to speak in the next days. “In Europe, the transfer window isn’t finished. “We are going to speak about all the possibilities,” Emery told reporters after the game at Anfield. Monreal has been linked with a return to Spain to sign for Real Sociedad. It is believed that he will sign a two-year contract with the option of a third season with the Spanish club.
