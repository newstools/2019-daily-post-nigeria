Following the unfortunate death of Mrs. Regina Mba of Nchatancha Nike in Enugu East Local Government Area, the Enugu State Government has directed the Management of ESUT Teaching Hospital Parklane, Enugu, to immediately carry out an autopsy on the deceased. In a statement by the Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Simon Uchenna Ortuanya, the medical exercise is to assist the security agencies in their ongoing investigations. DAILY POST reports that the deceased was allegedly killed by suspected Fulani herdsmen in Emene area of the State. In a related development, the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Chief Nnia Nwodo, has called for thorough investigation into her death. In a release by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Chief Emeka Attamah, the President General said that though the Executive of Ohanaeze Ndigbo in Enugu State had visited the home of the victim, it was still necessary for him to add his voice to the condemnation of the dastardly and inhuman act. Nwodo decried the growing tendency of some detractors of the state government who are out to destabilise the peace and tranquility in Enugu State that earned it the sobriquet of the most peaceful state in the country. The President General enjoined the state government not to be distracted by enemies of progress, but to continue to carry out measures it has put in place to secure lives and property in the state. He called on security agencies to unravel the conspiracy and tendency of hoodlums who are making the state insecure through incessant kidnappings and killings which hitherto were absent. He commiserated with the family of the deceased and urged them to bear the loss with fortitude. Nwodo called for general vigilance and precautions among the people to nip these acts in the bud.
