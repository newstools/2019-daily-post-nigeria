Former Manchester United star, Eric Djemba-Djemba has defended Midfielder Paul Pogba by comparing him with Arsenal playmaker, Mesut Ozil. Pogba has sometimes been criticised by football pundits over his playing style and perceived lack of effort on the pitch during Man United’s games. The France World Cup winner also suffered racist abuses after missing his spot-kick in Man United’s 1-1 draw with Wolves in the Premier League last Monday. But Djemba-Djemba now believes that it is “crazy” to suggest that the former Juventus star is not trying for United, adding that the 26-year-old’s plight is like that of Ozil at Arsenal. “Pogba has his style and he can’t do anything about that, he has always played like that since he played back in Italy,” Djemba-Djemba told American Gambler. “But English football is different; you need to work hard, tackle and more. Italian football is more tactical, but you need to be box-to-box in England, tackle and work hard. “If you watched [Wayne] Rooney playing as a striker, he would still come back and tackle hard. “Pogba has his style and he is a very good player. When you put Paul Pogba in the right position and he has the confidence, he is absolutely amazing. “It’s like Arsenal fans with Mesut Ozil. They think he is not trying but of course he is trying. It’s crazy!” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
