The Non-Academic Staff Union of Universities (NASU) and the Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Universities (SSANU) have commenced a five-day industrial action. DAILY POST gathered that members in the University of Lagos, Lagos State University, among others complied on Monday. The directive by the Joint Action Committee of NASU and SSANU was issued to all branch chairmen of the unions across the country on Friday. It explained that the action was as a result of the expiration of the 14-day ultimatum given to the Federal Government. The workers accused the government of failing to show firm commitment towards resolving the issues raised by the unions, including the payment of earned allowances to members. Others are the status of the university staff schools’ matter and the renegotiation of 2009 Agreements.
