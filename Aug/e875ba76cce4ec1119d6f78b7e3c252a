Nigerian rapper, Iceberg Slim, who broke up with popular Ghanaian actress, Juliet Ibrahim, after accusing her of being a toxic person took to his Instagram page on Tuesday to render a public apology to her, saying he has failed the ”screen goddess.” DAILY POST had reported the rapper’s outburst that led to their separation. Earlier on, Ibrahim had stated during an interview that she exited the relationship on mutual understanding. She equally refused to state clearly if cheating was the reason her relationship with the rapper ended. When asked if cheating was the reason for their split, she added, “I don’t know because they say and I hear all sorts of things but people close to me know what happened. I wouldn’t say because no matter what, I respect the people that I have been with. We broke up on a mutual term. However, Iceberg took to his Instagram page after one year of their breakup to apologize, stating that he cheated, lied, and took her love for granted. He wrote: ”Dear@Juliet Ibrahim thank you for everything. “You loved me unconditionally, even at my lowest points and only wanted loyalty and honesty in return. “Unfortunately, I have failed you with everyone else that has seen our relationship and wished us well. “Despite the pain and heartache i have caused you, you still found a way to rise and smile again. “ I lied, I cheated, I took your love for granted and in turn brought ridicule and shame to you.
“From the bottom of my heart, I apologize. Why now? You may ask.
“In life sometimes you have to reveal in other to heal, and as I have revealed the true reason for our break up healing comes next.
“As we continue on our separate paths I pray for God’s guidance.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
