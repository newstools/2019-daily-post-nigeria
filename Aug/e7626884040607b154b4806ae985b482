Chelsea striker, Tammy Abraham is delighted to have scored a brace in his side’s Premier League 3-2 victory over Norwich City on Saturday. Two goals from Tammy Abraham and a strike from Mason Mount gave Frank Lampard’s men all three points against Norwich. However, Norwich’s in-form striker, Teemu Pukki, did score for the host. ”It is something I have always dreamed about doing. To score for my childhood club. To get into the first team and to start scoring goals. I am just happy I can help my team,” Abraham was quoted by BBC Sport as saying. ”We knew coming here was never going to be easy, it’s always tough. We started off on the front foot, we knew we had to. We conceded but we came in to dressing room and knew there would be more chances. ”I wouldn’t say it’s a relief but we knew we had to win. The first two games of the season were tough. We came here knowing we needed the three points.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
