Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has said the club’s two-window transfer ban, makes the challenge of competing in this season’s Champions League harder. However, Lampard insisted he and his squad intend to go as far as they can, with what they have at their disposal. The Blues will learn their European fate for this season on Thursday, when UEFA hold the draw for the group stages. Chelsea find themselves in Pot 1 for the draw, meaning they can avoid various league champions, while they also cannot draw another English side. “It’s a big challenge for us as a team. “We know that with the difficulties of the ban and where we’re at. But it shouldn’t take away from the great challenge that it is to try to do well in [the Champions League]. “I think the Premier League is so strong and that is clear when you have two teams [like Man City and Liverpool]. Manchester City are clearly absolutely a top team in world football. “I think the English teams are strong at the moment and I hope that continues because I think that’s great for us in England and the Premier League. “It’s important for us, it’s where we want to be. “It gets tougher every year, coming third last year and winning the Europa League gets them that [elite] status. It is where we want to be. “I had some great nights in it, great moments and great memories. Talking about the players, they want to play in it and show what we are about. “It is nice that we are there. It means that we need to keep our league performances up now to be there next year and tackle it head on. “It is the greatest club competition in football and I was lucky enough to win it once. I’m looking forward to working in it as a manager,” Lampard told reporters ahead of the draw.
