The Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN) has written a letter to the Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) to stop posting graduates without education degrees to teach in schools. TRCN Registrar, Professor Segun Ajiboye, made this disclosure while speaking with journalists on Monday in Ibadan, the Oyo state capital. Ajiboye lamented that most of those posted to teach in the mandatory one-year scheme do not have the requisite qualification to teach. He noted that education system get bastardized when unqualified persons without requisite professional skills are deployed to teach. Ajiboye however admitted that there are challenges of having qualified teachers in some states of the federation. He stressed that majority of those teaching in private nursery and primary schools nationwide do not have the qualification to teach. Ajiboye also emphasised that those qualified must still be registered and professionally certified and licensed by the Council. According to him, only qualified and well-trained and re-trained teachers can bring about a transformed education that the Nigerian youth can benefit from. “We have written a letter to the NYSC Director-general that only those who read Education should be posted to schools during their service year. This will ensure that only round pegs are deployed to round holes. “Why are Doctors not posted to teach? Why are Education graduates not deployed to hospitals to operate the sick? If you cannot allow a teacher to treat you in the hospital why should you allow a fake teacher to teach your children and destroy their future. We should not debase teaching profession. “State governors must also ensure that they train and re-train those in their schools. Human capital development must be taken seriously to transform our education system,” he said.
