Two policemen attached to the Chief Medical Director of the Irrua Specialist Hospital, Prof. Sylvanus Okogbenin, have been killed by gunmen suspected to be kidnappers. Other persons in the convoy, whose identities are yet to be ascertained were also shot in their legs. Sources said the gunmen abducted Prof. Okogbenin after killing the policemen at Oregbene community by Ramat park junction in Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area while the CMD was coming to Benin. According to eyewitness, who spoke to DAILY POST, “we were very surprised when they used another vehicle to block the CMD. “The doors of the vehicle did not open normally but they have to break the glasses to penetrate, having shot repeatedly at the SUV, which we believe is a bullet-proof. “They shot two police officers, one died instantly and the man that rushed the other one to the hospital just came back now telling us that, he is also dead.” Police spokesmen, Chidi Uwanbuzor told our reporter that he was yet to get full details of the incident. It was gathered that two Assistant Directors of the hospital were abducted last week and were released after payment of ransom. Chairman of Senior Staff Association of Universities Teaching Hospital Research Institute and Associated Institutions of Nigeria, Irrua branch, Comrade Emmanuel Igiechi, said the union would protest against insecurity in the area. Comrade Igiechi said the abduction showed that staff of the hospital were being monitored. “This tells us how serious the security situation has become. It is a very dire situation we are in. The security agencies should strengthen their presence in Irrua and environs.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
