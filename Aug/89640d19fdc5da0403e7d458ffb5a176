Arsenal boss, Unai Emery has said that his team could not keep possession of the ball in their 3-1 loss to Liverpool in the Premier League on Saturday. Today was another difficult afternoon for Arsenal at the hands of the Reds. Arsenal have suffered in recent seasons against Jurgen Klopp’s side and today’s clash at Arsenal was not different. Egypt’s Mohamed Salah was the Liverpool hero in the second half, scoring two goals after Joel Matip had scored opener in the first half. “Yes we are disappointed we lost 3-1 but watching some players we can be optimistic, ” Emery told a post-match press conference. “We need to improve in possession and countering the pressure but Liverpool is the best team with this. “We have to be realistic but we can fight closer to them. For me today, without the result there were some good periods we showed.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
