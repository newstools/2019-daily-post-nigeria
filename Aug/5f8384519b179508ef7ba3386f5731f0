Ikechukwu Nwanyaku, a businessman, on Tuesday appeared before a Magistrates’ Court in Ajegunle, Lagos, over an alleged theft of 5,000 U.S. dollars equivalent to N1,800,000 from a trader. The 57-year-old defendant resides in Ojo area of Lagos. He is charged with three counts of assault with intent to steal, causing grievous hurt and theft but pleaded not guilty. The Prosecution Counsel, Insp. Babatope Julius said at the court sitting, “The defendant committed the alleged offence at 6.20pm on Aug. 21, at Onirike extension, opposite Ojo Military Cantonment, Lagos. “He punched the complainant, Mr Paul Okoye, who was on his way home from his shop in his left eye and used a metal rod to injure him on the right hand. “Nwanyaku stole 5,000 U.S. dollars (about N1.8million) and N52,000 from the complainant’s pocket and pushed him into the gutter.” The prosecutor added that the complainant said he was badly injured and was taken to the hospital for treatment. The offence, he said, contravened the provisions of sections 175, 246 and 280 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Section 175 stipulates a three-year jail term for assault with intent to steal while Section 287 stipulates three years imprisonment for the offence of stealing. Magistrate R.E. Ojudun admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N50,000 with two sureties in like sum. Ojudun ordered that the sureties must be gainfully employed and have evidence of three years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. He adjourned the case until October 17 for mention.
