The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi has disclosed that President Muhammadu Buhari assured him of retaining his position as Minister during the dissolution of the former cabinet. Amaechi made this disclosure during a reception after his swearing-in on Wednesday. The former Governor of Rivers State was among Ministers inaugurated yesterday by Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Speaking during the reception in his honour, Amaechi said: “The President told me the same week cabinet was dissolved that I will return you to cabinet. “I kept it a secret but I could have announced to you. So all those who were running helter-skelter, we knew that God would not allow them to have their way.” Amaechi, who appreciated God for his reappointment, said he would ensure that the ministry performs optimally to please the President and Nigerians at large. “We are grateful to God for the opportunity to serve again. I know how many of you were frightened that we would not get the appointment,” he said.
