Tottenham Hotspur boss, Mauricio Pochettino, has admitted that Christian Eriksen could still leave the club, before the European transfer window closes. Eriksen made his desire to leave clear and was linked with a big-money move to Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid or Manchester United. But neither Madrid club appear interested and United can no longer sign players after the close of the Premier League window. Eriken was dropped for Spurs’ season-opener against Aston Villa, but was introduced with just over an hour played at 1-0 down, helping his side overturn the deficit to win 3-1. But despite his performance, Pochettino has left the door open for the playmaker to leave. “You know more than me, things can still happen. “It is not in my hands if something happens or not. “Still we need to wait until September 2 and hope there are not too many changes or not too many problems for us. “We need to assess the circumstances. We will see what happens between now and September 2. Like we can change our minds, a player can change his, so until September 2 it is difficult to tell you if this will be the bravest group of players. “The team is still not settled how I expected it to be. We are still working in trying to make sure it is finished come September 2. That will be the moment to have a big conversation with the whole squad and settle the principle,” Pochettino told a press conference on Friday.
