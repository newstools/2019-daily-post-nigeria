Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, Housemate Seyi on Thursday disclosed his opinions about the brewing relationship between Frodd and Esther. Seyi speaking to Big Brother during his diary session on Thursday, said he felt Frodd and Esther were not a good love pair. According to him, “Frodd and Esther’s relationship is toxic and unhealthy. I don’t think they make a good pair.” DAILY POST recalls that Frodd at several occasions had proposed his love to Esther. However, Esther who seemed not to be interested in Frodd and has turned him down severally Also, Frodd almost got disqualified from BBNaija sometime last week after he was seen on Esther’s bed without underwear, while trying to touch and caress Esther’s body. Esther hesitated and warned Frodd to wear his boxers back on several times but he refused. This attracted Biggie’s attention as he called Frodd to an emergency diary session. After the diary session, Frodd who was earlier on Esther’s bed, returned suddenly to his own bed. It is not sure what Biggie told him at the diary session as it was not aired to the BBNaija fans but there is the possibility that Frodd may be issued a strike or be disqualified for harassment.
