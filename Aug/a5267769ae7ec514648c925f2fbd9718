Liverpool legend, Xabi Alonso, has backed Jurgen Klopp’s side to win the 2019/2020 Premier League title ahead of Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City this season. According to him, there is no reason why the UEFA Champions League and Super Cup winners cannot win the Premier League title ahead of Guardiola’s men this season. Guardiola’s City amassed 98 points during the 2018/2019 campaign but won the league on the final day of the season by just one point ahead of Liverpool. Speaking to BBC Sport, he said: “I am a Liverpool fan. “Last season it was phenomenal, the race that both teams [Liverpool and Man City] had. What Liverpool did, it’s going to be tough to repeat but they have the project that is stable, they know what they want but the Premier League is tough. It’s still early days, but why not? Alonso added: “Jordan Henderson has become a figure in the changing room. I think he’s so respected, so important for his team-mates – that’s the sense I get from watching in the stands. For the way they play it’s very important, the energy he has. “He’s able to take that step forwards, not backwards to make that pressure a bit higher. The way he connects with the three players up front, they play very direct and the way Liverpool is playing is the Jurgen way – the way they played at Dortmund with him and the way they play at Liverpool now.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
