Shehu Sani, immediate past Kaduna Central Senator, has reacted to the list of 80 Nigerians arrested by the United States government for fraud-related crimes. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in a press statement released in Los Angeles, California on Thursday by US attorney Nick Hanna, announced the arrest of “many Nigerians” in an ongoing investigation related to fraud cases. DAILY POST had reported that FBI named Valentine Iro, 31, and Chukwudi Christogunus Igbokwe, 38, both Nigerian citizens as lead suspects, adding that the duo allegedly coordinated with others to launder the funds from victims. The arrest of ‘80 Nigerians’ has stirred diverse reactions from Nigerians on social media even as some described the list of Nigerians as partial and tribalistic. Reacting, Shehu Sani on Twitter said the FBI charges should be a wake up call to the country. He wrote, “We must embrace the reality that the image of our country is seriously damaged by the fraudulent activities of our countrymen abroad. “The @FBI charges against Nigerians must be seen as a wake up call to do something now. Their acts stains us all and criminalize our country,” he added. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
