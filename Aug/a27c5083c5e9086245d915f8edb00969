Barcelona superstar, Lionel Messi, has said that French star, Ousmane Dembele, has learned his lesson and is now ready to focus on his game. Messi also promised to help the young star focus on his football, adding that the Frenchman can be one of the best in the world. Barcelona were all set to sell the young World Cup winner last summer due to his lack of concentration and injuries. But, speaking about the player in an interview, Messi said, “Ousmane can be one of the best. He’s a young guy who is adapting to the city and the club,” according to Eurosoccer. “He has already realized his mistakes and has rectified them. We are going to help him focus on football.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
