Minister of Police Affairs, Alhaji Muhammadu Dingyadi, says the All Progressives Congress (APC) will soon control Sokoto State. NAN reports that Dingyadi spoke on Thursday in Sokoto, when he met the state, zonal and local chieftains of the party. He expressed optimism that the party will soon take over the helms of affairs of Sokoto state and reverse “the current obnoxious trend of underdevelopment and neglect.” According to him, President Muhammadu Buhari would fulfil his key campaign promises of tackling the myriad of security challenges, improving the economy, as well as sustaining the ongoing anti corruption fight. The minister, however, solicited the support of all well meaning Nigerians to enable the government succeed. He stressed that all Nigerians were equal stakeholders in the Nigeria project and should collectively work towards moving the nation to the next level. He lauded President Buhari, APC leaders in the state, Sen. Aliyu Wamakko, as well as the party, for reposing tremendous confidence in him and pledged to live above board in the discharge of his responsibilities. Speaking earlier, Alhaji Sadiq Achida, state APC Chairman, said the visit was to felicitate with Dingyadi on his well deserved appointment.
