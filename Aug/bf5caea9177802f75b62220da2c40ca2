Liverpool defender, Trent Alexander-Arnold, has revealed how manager Jurgen Klopp inspired them to a 3-1 win over Arsenal on Saturday. Joel Matip’s 41st-minute header gave Klopp’s men the lead at half time. Mohammed Salah then netted two quick goals in the second, before Lucas Torreira pulled one back in the dying minutes. Alexander-Arnold has revealed how Klopp influenced the game at half-time. “The gaffer showed us a bit of [footage] at half-time and we could stretch them, with Mo, Bobby and Sadio [Mane], and get it into feet. “They probably set up knowing that we were going to cross it, they were ready. “[Against] other teams we try to create the yard and cross it from in front. The gaffer said to us at half-time, if we get a runner down we can get the ball down the outside. “[For Salah’s first], Hendo takes the ball out the way and I’m able to play it into Bobby and we got the pen. “That was the idea, to drag a centre-half out and not allow them to stay in and head the ball away,” Alexander-Arnold said.
