An Ikeja Magistrates’ court on Monday remanded a welder named Sesan Olaloye, over an alleged theft of machines worth N12 million. The 25-year-old is a resident of Ojokoro, Lagos. He is charged with two counts of conspiracy and stealing for which he pleaded not guilty. The Prosecutor, ASP Ezekiel Ayorinde told the court that Olaloye committed the offences in July at Ojokoro, Lagos. He, however, said that the defendant and others still at large, stole the machines belonging to Mrs Modinat Eketunde at night. “The defendant and others stole four colour printing machines, two side sealing machines, two folding machines and one sliding machine, all valued at N12 million. “Weeks later, the defendant came again to steal more machines, but luck was against him as he was apprehended by neighbours while his accomplices escaped. “He was handed over to the police,” the prosecutor told the court. “The alleged offences contravened sections 287(5) and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.” The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that section 287(5) carries seven years imprisonment for stealing while section 411 attracts two years for conspiracy. The Magistrate, Mrs B.O Osunsanmi granted the defendant bail of N1 million with two sureties as part of the bail condition. Osunsanmi said that the sureties should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case was adjourned till Sept. 30 for mention.
