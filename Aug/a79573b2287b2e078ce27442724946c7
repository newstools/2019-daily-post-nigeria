The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Friday urged it’s members in Japan to arrest President Muhammadu Buhari when he arrives the country. IPOB said its members should arrest Buhari and hand him over to security operatives because he his an impostor. Buhari will depart Abuja on Sunday for Japan to participate in the Seventh Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD7) holding in the City of Yokohama, August 28-30, 2019. Reacting to the trip, IPOB insisted that Buhari was Jibril Al-Sudan masquerading himself as Nigerian President. A statement signed by IPOB’s spokesperson, Emma Powerful, on Friday reads: “The formidable IPOB family in Japan is hereby placed on direct order to ensure the impostor Jubril Al-Sudani, masquerading as the late dictator Muhammadu Buhari, is arrested and handed over to the authorities when he sets foot on Japanese soil. “He is not only a fake president, he is wanted for mass murder and crimes against humanity for his role in previous and ongoing genocide in Biafraland. “Under Japanese law an impostor is a common criminal and subject to citizens arrest. International diplomatic protocol as it relates to visiting heads of state is not applicable in this instance because whoever Abba Kyari is sending to Japan is not the real Buhari. We must make sure he is apprehended and handed over to the police in Japan. “Any legal fall-out emanating from any confrontation will end up in a Japanese court where we will be able to establish before the world that Jubril is indeed a fake Buhari.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
