Rodrygo is likely to leave Real Madrid on loan, if Neymar arrives before the end of the transfer window, reports Marca. Neymar would require a non-EU player slot on Madrid’s roster and the LaLiga club currently has none remaining. Since the 18-year-old isn’t part of the plans this season and is training with club’s second team, he could depart on loan to clear up a non-EU spot. Madrid are still in the race to sign Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain, before the European transfer window closes on September 2. Zinedine Zidane is ready to offer €100million and three players for the Brazilian, who is also being courted by Barcelona and Juventus.
