Chelsea are ready to offer striker Tammy Abraham a new contract, that will more than double his wages, according to the Telegraph. Abraham netted his first two Premier League goals in the Blues’ 3-2 win over Norwich City last Saturday. With the Nigerian-born striker a firm favourite with manager Frank Lampard, the club wants to tie him down to a long-term deal. The new contract would see his wages bumped up to around £100,000-per-week. The deal would also allow Chelsea extend Abraham for an additional two years, with his current contract set to expire in 2022. Abraham has been at Stamford Bridge since joining the club as a youngster in 2004. He spent 12 years in the club’s youth set-up, before being promoted to the senior side in 2016.
