Nacho Monreal is on the verge of leaving Arsenal after agreeing a deal with Real Sociedad, according to Marca. The 33-year-old has spent just over six years with the Gunners but could fall down the pecking order this season following the signing of Kieran Tierney from Celtic. Unai Emery has already confirmed that Arsenal are open to selling Mohamed Elneny and Shkodran Mustafi before the transfer window closes across Europe. But they could also offload Monreal before September 2. It is claimed that Monreal will sign a two-year contract with the option of a third season with the Spanish club. Real Sociedad are confident that the transfer will be completed next week. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
