There was tension in Ilasamaja, Isolo Local Council Development Area (LCDA) of Lagos State on Saturday when residents of the community arrested four suspected kidnappers who have been terrorising the area for a few months now, and handed them to Ilasamaja police command. The four suspected kidnappers who confessed to the crime after questioning from men of the Nigeria Police Force, Ilasamaja command, revealed they were up to fifty in number since they started the crime business in the area. The kidnappers who confessed to the crime after series of investigations and torture disclosed to the community police station that other members of the gang had run away. One of the residents, Michael Ogunmoye who spoke to DAILY POST asserted that the suspects had carried out their nefarious activities in the community for a month before they were caught on Saturday. He said: “The kidnappers who deceive 3-5 (1 female, 4male) years old children with money, soft drinks, before they were charmed were napped by angry boys in the community who had been accused on several occasions of doing the job.” He explained that the four suspects were almost beaten to death by the boys before they were handed over to the police. Meanwhile, the DPO, Ilasha Police Station, CSP Ochogwu A.Ogbeh said the police would ensure the remaining 46 of the kidnapping gang members are arrested.
