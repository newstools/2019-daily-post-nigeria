Liverpool captain, Jordan Henderson has blamed himself for the goal scored by Arsenal in Reds 3-1 win over the Gunners on Saturday. He said there is still room for improvement despite Liverpool’s convincing win over Unai Emery’s side. Jurgen Klopp’s men kept up their 100 per cent record this season but the Reds captain identified a flaw in their performance. At this moment, Liverpool is the only side in the Premier League to maintain a perfect record after earning their third win from three this season. Two goals from Mohamed Salah and one from Joel Matip put the game beyond doubt before the Reds conceded a late consolation. Lucas Torreira pounced after his first effort was blocked to pull one back for Arsenal and ensure the Reds went another game without keeping a clean sheet. Herderson was not pleased with the goal. He told Livepool’s official website, “We knew if we did the right things, played to our strengths, defended really well and were clinical in front of goal, then we’d hurt them. “We managed to do that, so overall it was a really good performance. “If we want to be really critical, we’re disappointed with the goal. I should have cleared it on the edge of the box. “But we’ve got to be delighted with the three points, it’s tough in the Premier League. Another great performance.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
