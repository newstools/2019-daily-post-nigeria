The Governor of Ebonyi State, Chief David Umahi, on Monday sacked his Commissioner for Information and State Orientation in the state, Mr Ken Uhuo, over an alleged lack of commitment to duty. The Secretary to the State Government, Dr Kenneth Igbala, announced Uhuo’s sack on Tuesday on the radio. This is coming 24 hours after the Governor suspended his Special Assistant on Projects Monitoring ( Ebonyi South), Hon Felix Otta, over alleged lack of seriousness. Also, three weeks ago, the governor equally suspended another of his Special Assistant on Projects Documentation, Mr Francis Nweze for an alleged unseriousness to his duty. A source, who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity, said the sacked Commissioner was removed because he didn’t approach his job as information commissioner with propaganda, adding that everyone that understood the current state’s government modus operandi knew he was not going to last long with it. DAILY POST further gathered that the sack may be unconnected with the alleged failure of the commissioner to launch a counter attack on the members of Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, who have been attacking the governor on the social media. Ugbala, had during his announcement of the Commissioner’s sack on Tuesday, said “The Commissioner for Information and State Orientation, Ken Ohuo, has been removed from his office with immediate effect. “He has been removed for lack of commitment to the responsibilities of his office. It is a fact, that he is a quiet, good person; but he does not fit into the responsibility of the office. The State Government thank him so much and will in no time, re-screen him and find a suitable office for him,” he stated.
