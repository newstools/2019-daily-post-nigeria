The Anambra State Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, Sir Norbert Obi, has assured that the party was ready to move Anambra governorship position to the southern zone of the state in 2021. Obi said the party would field a candidate from the southern senatorial zone of the state, and was assured of victory. He said the party was founded in 2002 to champion the principles of justice, equity and fairness, and that moving the governorship position of the state to the southern zone was part of it. The state chairman, who spoke with newsmen at the party’s Secretariat in Awka said, “This is the reason why the party is uncompromising in its belief in true federalism in the country. “Anambra, which is controlled by APGA’s leader and board of trustees Chairman, Governor Willie Obiano is the first state government to host the first ever Summit on the Restructuring of the Nigerian-Nation through Ohaneze Ndigbo in Awka. “We believe in equity and justice, and it is under this strongholds that the party was founded.” Obi also observed that his party has made zoning and rotation of the governorship seat of the State one of its principles and reiterated that Governor Obiano’s successor in 2022 will emerge from Anambra South Senatorial district. The Anambra State APGA Chairman recalled that the final decision on zoning and rotation was reached under the supervision and approval of the supreme leader of the party, late Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu, during a crucial meeting of Anambra stakeholders at Nteje in Oyi local government area. He assured that the party will continue to encourage the present Anambra State government to remain focused in the task of delivering enduring democracy dividends to the people, as it was also part of the belief of APGA.
