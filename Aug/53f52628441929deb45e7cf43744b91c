Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, Housemate Cindy on Friday night kissed fellow housemate Sir Dee. DAILY POST recalls that Cindy was introduced to the house during BBNaija twist as one of the five new housemates alongside Enkay, Venita,Joe and Elozonam Cindy, since her entrance into the reality show, has been criticised and described by some BBNaija fans as â€˜localâ€™ and not posh like other housemates. However, Leo had defended Cindy, describing her as a representation of every average Nigerian lady who is not ashamed of her background. Cindy who has never been caught up in an intimate relationship on Friday night kissed Sir Dee during a game in the garden. Cindy kissed Sir Dee from his legs upwards to his waist and played with his nipples which caused a rousing moment in the house. It is not certain if Cindy has interest in Sir dee as she chose him over Omashola. Recall thag Omashola was days ago caught kissing Venita just few days after Biggie introduced new housemates.
