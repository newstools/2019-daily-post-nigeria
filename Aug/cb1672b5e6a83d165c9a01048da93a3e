Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has disclosed that forward, Eden Hazard cannot play for Belgium ‘legally’. According to him, it is for the good of everyone that the former Chelsea star does not play for his country’s Euro 2020 qualifiers against San Marino and Scotland on September 6 and 9 respectively. Hazard, who will miss Real Madrid’s La Liga clash against Villarreal on Sunday, suffered a muscular injury before the start of the season. But Zidane has now said that he does not want to see the 28-year-old feature for Belgium against San Marino or Scotland. “Legally he [Hazard] can travel with Belgium but at the moment he cannot play,” Zidane was quoted by Sportmole as saying at his pre-match press conference ahead of Villarreal clash on Sunday. “He knows that, we do too and I hope he doesn’t play, for the good of everyone, including Belgium.” Hazard on Friday won 2018/19 UEFA Europa League Player of the Season. He will hope to feature for Real Mardi when they take on Levante on September 14 at the Santiago Bernabeu. .
