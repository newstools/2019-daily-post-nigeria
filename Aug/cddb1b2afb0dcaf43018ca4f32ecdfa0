Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has put faith in Marcus Rashford to take the team’s next penalty, after his miss against Crystal Palace on Saturday, the UK Independent reports. The 21-year-old made no mistake from 12 yards against Chelsea on the opening weekend. And when United were awarded a penalty during their 1-1 draw with Wolves last Monday, he was expected to assume responsibility. But Paul Pogba stepped up and saw his kick saved by Rui Patricio. When United were awarded another penalty against Palace on Saturday, Rashford grabbed the ball, only to see his effort come crashing off the post. Consecutive failures to convert from the spot have cost Manchester United points in their previous two games, but Solskjaer is not concerned about the issue and has told Rashford to continue taking penalties.
