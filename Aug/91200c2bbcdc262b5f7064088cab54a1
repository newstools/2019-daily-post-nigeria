Nollywood Actress, Uche Jombo has condemned the recent ban pronounced by the world football governing body, FIFA, on Nigerian former player and coach, Samson Siasia. DAILY POST had reported earlier that that the former Super Eagles gaffer has been banned for life by FIFA over match fixing related issues. The former Nigerian attacker has since denied receiving any notification of the ban from FIFA. Reacting, Jombo described FIFA’s ban on Siasia as a bad reputation for Nigerian football. She said this in a post on her Twitter page. Jombo wrote: “This Samson Siasia matter is bad for Nigerian football; handed a life ban by FIFA and fined $50k for “accepting” to take bribes to manipulate games. “ Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
