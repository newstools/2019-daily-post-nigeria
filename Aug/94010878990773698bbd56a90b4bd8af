Barcelona defender, Gerard Pique, has admitted they deserve to lose to Athletic Bilbao, after beginning their LaLiga defence with a 1-0 defeat at San Mames on Friday. Aritz Aduriz netted a stunning overhead kick in the 89th minute, to snatch all three points for the hosts. The result is likely to see pressure again begin to mount on manager Ernesto Valverde, who came under fire at the end of last season for Barca’s Champions League capitulation against Liverpool, as well as the Copa del Rey final loss to Valencia. Speaking to reporters after the match, Pique said: “San Mames is always very difficult and today the competition put us in our place,” he told Movistar. “We weren’t ourselves. From the start, they pressed us a lot and physically they were better, although in the second half they dropped off a little. “In the end, winning or losing comes down to details, and we leave with a defeat that will be good for us, because it’s better to lose now than at the end of the season. “We came from pre-season, there are new people… sometimes, you prepare for a game in one way and it doesn’t happen as you expected. “In the first half, they had one clear chance, [Inaki] Williams’ one, and we had Luis hit the post. “We played more in our own half, but that’s what you expect at San Mames. In the second half, we played more in their half, but details are details and one killed us in the end.” Barcelona’s next match will come at home to Real Betis, before they travel to Osasuna.
