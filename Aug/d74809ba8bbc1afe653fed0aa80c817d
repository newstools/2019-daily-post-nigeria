The Election Tribunal sitting in Kaduna on Saturday dismissed the petition filed by People’s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Lawal Adamu Usman, against Uba Sani of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Sani won the February senatorial election for Kaduna Central. Delivering the judgment, Chairman of the Tribunal, Justice A.H. Suleiman said the petitioner could not sustain his petition as the evidence adduced were based on hearsay. He held that the PDP candidate failed to prove any of his allegations of corrupt practices, over voting and election violence. Reacting, Usman, through a statement by his spokesman, Abdulazeez Sulaiman, said: “We are today more convinced of the beauty of democracy which provides judicial avenues for seeking redress. “As thoroughbred democrats, we never doubt the impartiality of the judiciary even though as humans, judges too, do have their individual set of biases. “The justice system involves several steps and we shall explore all available windows to the final stage.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
