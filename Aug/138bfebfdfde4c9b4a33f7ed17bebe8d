Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba held his hands up and apologised to his teammates after missing a penalty against Wolves in his side’s Premier League 1-1 draw on Monday night. DAILY POST had reported that the France international, who was awarded the penalty, stepped up after discussing with Rashford but saw his kick saved by Rui Patricio at the Molineux. According to The Sun, Pogba was enormously upset after the match and told his Man United teammates he was sorry for missing the penalty against Wolves, in the Molineux dressing room afterwards. The former Juventus star has now missed four of his last nine penalties. The 26-year-old has one of the worst spot-kick records in Premier League history of players to take at least 10. Meanwhile, Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has now designated Marcus Rashford as the team’s permanent penalty taker ahead of Pogba. Man United will take on Crystal Palace in their next Premier League fixture this weekend.
