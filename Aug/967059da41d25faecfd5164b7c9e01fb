Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, wanted to sign Steven Nzonzi instead of Lucas Torreira last summer, according to The Athletic. Torreira joined the club from Sampdoria in a deal worth around £22million and became a popular figure during an impressive debut campaign at the Emirates. But it is understood that Emery had concerns about his height, frame and physical capabilities. Instead, he wanted to sign Nzonzi, as he had worked with him at Sevilla and was positive that the Frenchman’s previous experience in the Premier League would help him settle quicker. However, Nzonzi is seven years older than Torreira and the Frenchman would have had little sell-on value. So Arsenal’s recruitment team convinced Emery to sign the Uruguay international instead.
