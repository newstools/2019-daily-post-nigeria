LA Galaxy striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, believes he is still good enough to play in the Premier League and joked Manchester United know where he is if they want to re-sign him. The 37-year-old scored twice in the El Trafico Derby, as his LA Galaxy team drew 3-3 with rivals Los Angeles FC in a pulsating MLS clash. Those two goals took him to 22 strikes in as many league matches this season, including six in the last three games. Ibrahimovic believes his current form, shows he could comfortably compete in England’s top-flight again. “I could play easy in the Premier League, so if United needs me, I’m here. “But Galaxy has me, so I’m sorry. “Nah, I did my job in Europe. I enjoyed it, I have 33 trophies that I brought with me here and hopefully I can get something here. And then we will see where that adventure finishes,” Ibrahimovic told reporters. Ibrahimovic spent two season at Old Trafford between 2016 and 2018, scoring 29 times in 53 matches.
