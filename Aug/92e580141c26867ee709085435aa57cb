South-South Consultative Forum, SSCOF, has called on the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, and Minister of State for Niger Delta Affairs, Festus Keyamo, to set up a think-tank that will come out with a blueprint in synergy with governors of the South-South for sustainable development of the zone. President of the Forum, Mr Moses Mugidi, made the call on Thursday while briefing journalists after an enlarged meeting of the group in Effurun, Delta State. He said, “As we celebrate your appointment (Keyamo) and elevation (Omo-Agege), only credible development can cause you to win and keep the people’s support towards a better South-South as well as build on your current political portfolio. “I implore you to carry everyone along in the South-South, those you know can contribute to the development of the region irrespective of political affiliation.” While calling on youths at home and abroad to exercise caution when venting their anger on matters that border on issues affecting the country, he warned political leader of a repeat attack on former Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, in Germany, if they fail in their responsibility. He said: “The political leaders should know that each passing day opens up a new thinking and action plan in the minds of angry Nigeria youths who feel cheated and abandoned in their own country. “Political leaders need to redouble their efforts to justify the confidence reposed on them to represent their people at whatever position they find themselves. “It is time indeed to justify their positions in office or be treated like what happened (to Ekweremadu) in Germany.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
