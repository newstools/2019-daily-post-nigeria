Chairman, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Screening Committee for Bayelsa and governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde, says the party has no preferred aspirant for its primary election in Bayelsa. Makinde said this while speaking at the screening of PDP aspirants for Bayelsa on Monday at Wadata Plaza, Abuja. Makinde noted that the committee would be fair to all governorship aspirants from the state to ensure that the party went into proper election strong and united. “We don’t want a situation whereby our party will go into the election with a divided house”, NAN quoted him as saying. “We want to go into the election as one big family that we are, with a view to retaining the state,” Makinde said. He expressed optimism that PDP would continue to remain a strong and united party, even after the primaries. Makinde appealed to all aspirants to cooperate with the committee to make the exercise easy.
