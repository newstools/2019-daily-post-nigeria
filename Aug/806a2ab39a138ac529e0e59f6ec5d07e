Liverpool forward, Sadio Mane, has said “sorry” for helping to lead the team to a 2-1 win over Southampton on Saturday. Mane broke the deadlock on his latest return to St Mary’s. The Senegal international then laid the assist for Roberto Firmino to make it 2-0. Mane left Southampton for Merseyside back in 2016, but still holds fond memories of his time with Southampton. He told BBC Sport: “I’m sorry it is against my old team and sorry I have to score but I’m wearing a Liverpool shirt now. “Southampton was a very good step for me, I have big respect for this club. “It is an amazing place. I learned a lot here and they are very nice people. But it is part of football and you have to deal with it.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
