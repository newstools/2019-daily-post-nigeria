Manchester United, Paul Pogba, is now regretting his decision not to force a move away from the club this summer,according to AS. The France midfielder admitted in June, that he wanted “a fresh challenge”. Pogba has been heavily linked with Real Madrid and Juventus ever since. United were adamant the player would not be sold for under £180m and although there are a few days remaining in the transfer window, the Pogba now looks set to remain at Old Trafford. Real boss, Zinedine Zidane, is a big fan of the midfielder and made no secret of his wish to take him to the Bernabeu. But it is understood he expected Pogba to push for the move and his failure to do so, has all but ended Real’s hopes of signing him.
