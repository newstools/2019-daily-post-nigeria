Popular Nigerian comedian, Francis Agoda, popularly known as ‘I Go Die’, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to release co-convener of the RevolutionNow movement, Omoyele Sowore. Sowore, who was the 2019 presidential candidate of the African Action Congress, AAC, was arrested by the Department of State Services, DSS, over alleged plot to overthrow President Buhari earlier this month. Reacting to Sowore’s continued detention, I Go Die called on Buhari to release the pro-democracy activist because the President once overthrew the government of Shehu Shagari. In a post on his Instagram page, the comedian wrote: “President Muhammadu Buhari, you were 41 years old in 1983 when you overthrew Shehu Shagari, the first democratically elected President of Nigeria on December 31, 1983, and truncated our democracy at the time. “We cannot totally agree that all is well when more than 10 per cent of our population has left the country in search of greener pastures. What then is the hope of those left in the country? “The conscience of man is better than the laws of the white man. Please kindly treat Sowore as one of your sons whose ultimate goal is to have a better society. “I am human and I feel the pains of millions of Nigerians who sleep every day without a meal, blinded by a hopeless situation. “Please sir, on behalf of the voiceless, listen to the voice of reason, #FreeSowore and make Nigeria better than you met it.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
