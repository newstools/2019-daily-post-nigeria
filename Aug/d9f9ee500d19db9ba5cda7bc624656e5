Former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Timi Frank, on Friday described the tribunal judgment sacking Dino Melaye as Senator representing Kogi West as a “distraction from his governorship ambition.” Frank claimed that Melaye was sacked because APC was afraid that the lawmaker would win the forthcoming governorship election in the state. DAILY POST had reported the election of Melaye was nullified by the Kogi State National Assembly/State Assembly Election Petition Tribunal on Friday. The tribunal also ordered a fresh election in Kogi West Senatorial District. Reacting to the ruling, Frank expressed optimism that the Appeal Court will do justice to the case. In a statement, he signed and forwarded to DAILY POST, Frank urged Melaye’s constituents to be resolute and be rest assured that the outspoken Senator truly won his election. Frank, while commending the chairman of the panel “for standing by the truth,” added that “all efforts by the desperate All Progressives Congress to remove the best performing Senator from the red chamber will fail woefully at the Appeal Court. “Lies may succeed for a while but the truth will surely prevail. I urge the vibrant Senator Melaye not to lose focus, believe in God of justice and surely bear in mind that all his enemies will be put to shame.” Frank, who also called on Melaye’s constituents to stand by him and not allow “evil to prevail on their worthy representative,” added that the lawmaker’s governorship ambition should not be threatened by the tribunal judgment which he described as “distraction.” He revealed that the ruling APC elements were behind the ‘miscarriage of justice’ at the tribunal “because they are afraid that if Senator Dino Melaye finally secure the governorship ticket of the PDP, he will certainly win the election and uproot APC in Kogi State.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
