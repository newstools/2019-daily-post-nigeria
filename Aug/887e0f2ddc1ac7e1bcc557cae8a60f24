A Minna Magistrates’ Court on Friday, ordered that a herdsman, Mohammed Bello, be remanded in prison custody for allegedly killing a farmer, pending legal advice. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Magistrate, Mariam Kings declined his plea on grounds that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Kings directed the police to forward the case file to the State Director of Public Prosecution for legal advice. She adjourned the matter until Sept. 26 for further mention. The Prosecution Counsel, Insp. Aliyu Yakubu, in the charge sheet, charged Bello with three counts of criminal trespass, mischief and culpable homicide, contrary to sections 348, 327 and 222 of the Penal Code law. Yakubu alleged that the accused person was arrested in Rubochi village in Lapai Local Government Area on Aug. 2. He said that the accused person deliberately led his cattle into the farm of one Haruna Mohammed and destroyed his crops. According to him, when Bello was cautioned, he removed his cutlass and slashed Mohammed and he bled to his death.
