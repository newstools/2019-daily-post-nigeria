Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, the newly appointed Minister of Interior, has admitted that he knows little or nothing about how the ministry operates. The former Osun state Governor stated this after resuming office at the ministry, shortly after his inauguration and assignment of portfolio by President Muhammadu Buhari. Addressing the staff and newsmen at the ministry, Aregbesola confessed that apart from reports about the ministry he read in newspapers, he had no idea of its policies and operations. “My relationship with the ministry is distant. What I know about the ministry is what I read in the Newspapers,” he said. Aregbesola, however, directed the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Georgina Ehuriah, to continue running the ministry until Monday when he will formally take over. “I will come to take over on Monday. I give the Permanent Secretary the grace to run the ministry till then. “We will be ready by Monday to take on the huge assignment. “I promise you a realistic, reasonable and commendable leadership. The staff of this ministry should be ready for more work because I will be demanding much more from you,” he added.
