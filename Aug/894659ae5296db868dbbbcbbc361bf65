Former Arsenal star, Ray Parlour has said the club is “a million miles away” from winning the Premier League. The Gunners have begun the new season with a 100 per cent record after wins against Newcastle and Burnley. Unai Emery’s men finished fifth last season, 28 points off Pep Guardiola’s title winners Manchester City, and Parlour thinks any talk of them seriously challenging for the famous trophy is premature. “I heard a few shows yesterday saying we can challenge for the league, but they’re a million miles away from Man City and Liverpool at the moment, if I‘m honest. “How many Arsenal players would get into the Liverpool team? “The most important think is getting back into the Champions League. Maybe they could push a bit higher, but if they get fourth place this season I’d be delighted. “A lot of fans gave their season tickets back this summer. There were no signings and if you want to get in that top four you need to get players in to give them a chance of competing. “At one stage it looked like Arsenal weren’t going to get anybody, it was a bit worrying. “In the end it was a decent transfer window for Arsenal and a lot of fans are excited about going into the new season. “But they are so far behind Manchester City and Liverpool at the moment. “They’ve started well with a good away win at Newcastle and they got the job done at the weekend against Burnley, but really they are two games they were expected to win, so I’m not getting carried away,” Parlour told TalkSport.
