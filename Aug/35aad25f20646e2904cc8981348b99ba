Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate, Esther, was at the early hours of Thursday pranked by fellow housemates; Sir Dee and Frodd. It all started at the garden when Frodd approached Sir Dee all of a sudden for speaking ill about him to other housemates and hurled insults at him This resulted into a serious argument between both housemates for some minutes l, which attracted Esther and other housemates to the garden to separate them. While Tacha and Omashola tried to calm down Sir Dee, Mercy and other housemates were pacifying Frodd. However, when Esther got into the garden trying to separate the fight between Frodd and Sir Dee she was thrown to one corner as Frodd shouted happy birthday to her. He later sang a birthday song for her alongside Sir Dee and other housemates, adding that the supposed fight between him and Sir Dee was fake and intended to bring Esther to the garden to celebrate her birthday. Esther in reaction buried her head in between her laps as she hugged all housemates in excitement. Frodd and Sir Dee’s action earned them reactions and approval from Nigerians and BBNaija fans on social media.
