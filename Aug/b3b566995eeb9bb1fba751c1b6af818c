Hamisu Bala, a notorious billionaire kidnap kingpin, also known as Wadume, has confessed that men of the Nigeria Army actually helped him escape on August 6 after he was arrested by the police. Two police officers attached to the special anti-kidnap squad of the Inspector General of Police and a civilian were killed when soldiers opened fire on them. DAILY POST had reported that the Force Public Relations Officer, DCP Frank Mba, had earlier issued a statement that the Police Operatives, led by ASP Felix Adolije of the Intelligence Response Team (IRT) reportedly came under sudden attack by soldiers along Ibi–Jalingo Road. In reaction, the army accepted responsibility for the killings. It, however, explained that the killings were done in error following a distress call that some suspected kidnappers who happened to be the police were on the run with their victim. The incident generated a public row between the police and soldiers, with Nigerians completely appalled. The suspected kidnapper, who has since been re-arrested by police detectives in a hideout in Kano, confessed in a video obtained by the Nation during police interrogation that soldiers assisted him to escape. Wadume, who spoke in Hausa, said, “I am Hamisu Bala also known as Wadume. The police came to Ibi and arrested me. “After arresting me, they were taking away when soldiers went after them and opened fire and some policemen were killed. “From there the soldiers took me to their headquarters and cut off the handcuffs on my hands and I ran away. “Since I ran away, I have been hiding until now that the police arrested me.” Video:  Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
