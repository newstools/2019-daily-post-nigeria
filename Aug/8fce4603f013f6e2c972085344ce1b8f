Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate, Diane on Monday night told the winner of this week’s veto power card, Elozonam that she knew he was not going to save her from this Sunday’s live eviction. DAILY POST had reported that seven BBNaija housemates, including Mike, Seyi, Mercy, Diane, Frodd, Jackie and Gedoni have been selected for possible eviction this week. The housemates were nominated after the ‘Cruistopia team’ were defeated during the arena game challenge. Elozonam, who won the veto power on Sunday, saved Venita and replaced her with Frodd from her team, ‘Cruistopia’. “I saw it coming that you weren’t going to save me,” Diane told Elozonam while they were in the Garden. “What’s the difference between my action and the one you made last week?” Elozonam replied. After making Diane see things from his own view together with her encouragement that she wasn’t upset about the situation, they both ended the night on Elozonam’s bed where they held hands for a while before she put him to bed. Meanwhile, speaking after the nomination challenge, Elozanam said he saved Venita because Frodd would most likely be saved by the viewers. Elozanam said, ”I know why I saved you, you see Frodd was saved last week, he has fans but look at us, we just came in two weeks ago. We don’t know our faith yet.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
