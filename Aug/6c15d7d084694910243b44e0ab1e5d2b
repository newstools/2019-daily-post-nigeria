Boxing promoter, Eddie Hearn, has said that Anthony Joshua will not consider retiring if he loses his rematch against Andy Ruiz Jr. Joshua will attempt to reclaim the WBO, WBA and IBF world titles he lost to Ruiz Jnr, when he meets him for a second time in Saudi Arabia this December. The Brit suffered the first defeat of his professional career when he was stopped in seven rounds by the Mexican. There are concerns if Joshua, who recently admitted he had become disillusioned with the sport, were to lose to Ruiz again that he would walk away from boxing. However, his promoter, Hearn has insisted that is not the case. “It would be a hard defeat to take. People say “Do you think he’s finished?”, but Joshua’s only 29. “He’s a competitor and he will want to go and rebuild again. How you lose is a different story, but I think he will win the fight. “I also know that it’s a dangerous fight, he’s got a lot mentally to overcome. It’s going to be epic,” Hearn told The Sportsman.
