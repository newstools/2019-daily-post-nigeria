Leicester City boss, Brendan Rodgers has taken the blame for the error that led to Chelsea’s goal in their 1-1 draw in the Premier League yesterday. Mason Mount dispossessed Wilfried Ndidi of the ball right at the edge of the Leicester City area to score for Chelsea. Ndidi, then blasted home a staggered finish less than ten minutes into the game to give Rodgers’ men the equaliser. Leicester boss absolved Ndidi of any blame, and claimed the fault was all his. “It is my fault, the mistake [that led to Chelsea’s goal], because I ask my players to build in the game. But it was a brilliant response,” Brendan Rodgers told Match of the Day. “We were outstanding in the second half but didn’t win the game. We came out with a positive mindset and had chances to put it to bed. “The most important thing is getting the players into those positions. It’s still very early in the season. In the second half, I thought we were very good. We will look for three points next week.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
