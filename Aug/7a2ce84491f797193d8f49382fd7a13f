The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has threatened to humiliate President Muhammadu Buhari anytime he travels outside the country. The group also issued a similar threat against Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, Nigeria’s Chief of Army Staff. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the IPOB, issued the threat during a Sunday live broadcast on Radio Biafra. He lampooned the two leaders for launching ‘Operation Python Dance’ against “armless” Biafran agitators in the South East, during which many IPOB members were reportedly killed. “Any day you see Jubril a.k.a Buhari or Buratai anywhere outside Nigeria, they will understand the meaning of anger”, Kanu stated in his live broadcast. Similarly, IPOB spokesman, Emma Powerful, who confirmed Kanu’s position in an exclusive chat with DAILY POST on Monday, urged other Nigerian tribes to begin the process of holding their political leaders responsible for alleged misgovernance. “We are calling on other tribes in Nigeria to start the process of holding their politicians and elites to account because IPOB and its leadership have started their own,” he said. DAILY POST had earlier reported that the IPOB placed a N1 million bounty on four governors in the South East region. The affected governors include Dave Umahi (Ebonyi), Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu), Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia) and Willie Obiano (Anambra). The announcement comes barely 24 hours after Senator Ike Ekweremadu, immediate past Deputy Senate President, was attacked by members of IPOB in Germany, on Saturday. Kanu had earlier praised the act of his members, while sending a strong note of warning to the governors and Chief Nnia Nwodo, President-p of Ohanaeze Ndigbo.
