Former Arsenal defender, Nigerl Winterburn has said the club missing out on a deal to bring Philippe Coutinho back to the Premier League, should not be seen as a blow. There were speculations that the Gunners tried to bring the former Liverpool playmaker in on a loan deal. Barca were eager to part with Coutinho but no agreement was reached. “I don’t consider Arsenal missing out on Coutinho as a blow because I don’t think that it was ever realistic. “Some of the figures that were bandied about, I’ve read that the deal could be worth up to £40 million, would have been an incredible investment from Arsenal for a loan deal and something that just cannot happen. “He’s a terrific player, I think he would enhance most squads, but I don’t see it as a missed opportunity, because I was never convinced it was an option,” Winterburn told Sportingbet.
