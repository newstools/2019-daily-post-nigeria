Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has said Matteo Guendouzi must improve physically and mentally. The 20-year-old was signed from Lorient last summer, but has forced himself into Emery’s midfield. Guendouzi has started both of Arsenal’s Premier League matches so far and is reportedly on the verge of signing a new lucrative £70,000-a-week contract extension. Despite his status as an established first team star, Emery is conscious that Guendouzi still has areas to work on. “We have a lot of young players who can develop a lot. We are going to push them and also we are going to push them. “Matteo is very young but he has talent, his talent is to adapt to what we need. “We are working tactically and individually, a lot on videos and a lot on the pitch. It’s a big challenge for me and him to achieve a big level here. “Last year his process was very good but we miss a lot with him to achieve big moments. “Really, really I am very optimistic with him because he has this talent. We can improve other things, physically – we are working in the gym – his mentality. “He has potential right now to help us achieve the best performance,” Emery told the media on Thursday, ahead of the Gunners’ trip to Liverpool this weekend.
