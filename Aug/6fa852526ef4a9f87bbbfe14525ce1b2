Norwich and Crystal Palace have been dumped out of this season’s Carabao Cup on Tuesday night. Daniel Farke made 11 changes for their trip to Crawley and were stunned 1-0 by the League Two outfit. Bez Lubula’s deflected effort sealed victory for Crawley. Palace named a much stronger side, but couldn’t find their way through against another League Two side in Colchester. The game went to penalties and Andros Townsend saw his effort saved, as Colchester came through 5-4. In other fixtures, Southampton beat Fulham 1-0, Aston Villa hammered Crewe Alexandra 6-1, West Ham saw off New Port County 2-0 and Watford thrashed Coventry City 3-0.
