Super Eagles midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi has been criticised by ex-Chelsea star, Andy Townsend, following his error in the first half of their 1-1 draw with the Blues. Ndidi was caught in possession for Chelsea’s goal, with Mason Mount pouncing to make it 1-0. The Nigerian, however, made amends when he headed in the equaliser after the break. Townsend, while speaking on Sky Sports, described Ndidi as “closed” and “unaware”. He said: “He got the team in front and it was a much deserved lead because it was such an important start, such a great opening. It was a really, really good finish. “He does ever so well to rob Ndidi, who is a little bit closed and a little bit short of and not really aware. That’s a brilliant goal.” Liverpool legend, Graeme Souness also blamed Ndidi for his poor control in the build-up to the goal. “His first touch could be better and he ends up on his feet. He’s in the clear, he’s still under the feet with his first touch – he should be a wee-bit stronger. “Give credit to Mason Mount who went after him. With Ndidi, if you accept the ball in that situation, you’ve got to assume that the worst-case scenario is that someone’s coming at you and he didn’t,” Souness said.
