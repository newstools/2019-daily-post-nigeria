Liverpool initially planned to sell three Nigerian players in the summer but ended up loaning the trio in the summer transfer window, according to Liverpool Echo. The newspaper reported that despite the club’s desire to sell, Ejaria and Awoniyi only left the club on loan while a permanent move also could not be found for Ojo. While Ojo is spending the whole of this season at Rangers, Awoniyi and Ejaria have moved to Mainz 05 and Reading FC respectively on loan. Ojo has been in blistering form since his move to Scotland, scoring 4 goals in 7 appearances across all competitions, and Ejaria has caught the eye in his last two games for the Royals. Nigeria U23 international, Awoniyi made his Bundesliga debut on the opening day of the season against SC Freiburg after coming off the bench in the 86th minute. Both Ojo and Ejaria have made competitive appearances for Liverpool’s first team.
