The Chairman of the Ekiti State Chapter of the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, Mr Kolapo Olatunde, announced on Monday that the Federal Government would commence payment of the long-awaited new wage from next month. Olatunde made the known in an interview with the Labour Correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ado-Ekiti on Monday. He said, “I speak to you as a right source that nothing will stop the implementation of the N30, 000 minimum wage next month. “Government will pay the new minimum wage in the first week of September. “After the National Executive Council meeting of the NLC in Kano, we have streamlined everything that can cause any further delay of the payment. “Now, we are waiting for the outcome,’’ Olatunde stated. He said that the issue of consequential adjustment raised by labour, to properly harmonise payment of the new wage had delayed the payment. The labour chief said the payment could start from early week of September when he was asked to state the exact date workers should expect the payment. He noted that the reappointed Minister of Labour and Employment, Sen. Chris Ngige, had taken it as his priority to ensure that the minimum wage issue was finally resolved. Organised Labour and the Federal Government have been locked in an endless bickering on the modalities for the payment of the new minimum wage which was approved by government earlier this year.
