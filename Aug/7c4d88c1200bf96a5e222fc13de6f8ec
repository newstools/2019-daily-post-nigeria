In continuation of the 2019 prison tour, the Chief Judge of Kogi State, Justice Nasir Ajanah, has discharged nine inmates awaiting trial in Okene Prison. The inmates, whom he released unconditionally, were; Ige Kekere, Onipe Ojo, Balegi Agbaje, Danjuma Eguru, Adamu Audu, Samuel Emmanuel and Uzochi Ebuka, who he termed a psychiatric case and declared unfit to undergo trial. Others which the Chief Judge released on bail were: Onimisi Fatai Sadiq and Shaibu Yusuf. Ajanah, who freed the inmates on Wednesday in Okene, said the exercise was in line with the powers bestowed on him by the law. He explained that the visit to prisons was aimed at decongesting the prisons and aiding in the smooth transition from Nigeria Prison Service to Nigeria Correctional Facility. While reviewing the cases of the inmates, who were remanded on offences bordering on criminal conspiracy, armed robbery, theft, criminal intimidation, rape, and attempt to commit murder, Ajanah said incarceration of an inmate for more than 4 years without progressive trial was unconstitutional no matter how justified an offence is. He appealed to the released inmates to be of good behavior so that they do not return to the prison. Earlier, the Comptroller in charge of Okene Prison, said there were 68 prisoners out of which 38 of them were convicted and 28 awaiting trial including 1 female each.
