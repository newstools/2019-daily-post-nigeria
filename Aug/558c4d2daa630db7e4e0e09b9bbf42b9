Manchester United defender, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, has revealed that Paul Pogba advised him to “play without fear”, when he signed for the club in June. The 21-year-old, who joined from Premier League rivals Crystal Palace, was one of the new faces Ole Gunnar Solskjaer brought in this summer. Speaking to United’s pre-match programme ahead of the Premier League clash against Crystal Palace, Wan-Bissaka reflected on how he had been welcomed into the squad by existing members. “Paul Pogba has advised me a lot. “That first game in Perth, he was telling me the same thing everyone has: you’re here for a reason, play your game, play without fear, get up and down – that’s what I put into my head,” Wan-Bissaka said. Wan-Bissaka further revealed that he felt he was improving his game from exposure to United’s attack in training, adding: “I’m up against Anthony [Martial] a lot. It’s tough, but you take the positives. It helps both of us. “Playing against someone with quick feet like him, you can’t not learn. Our attackers have all got a lot of pace, so you just have to be concentrated and focused for their next move all the time.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
