Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, invited three promising Nigerian teenagers to train with the first team on Wednesday, according to Jeorge Bird. Bukayo Saka, Folarin Balogun and James Olayinka took part in the session, as the Gunners prepare for their trip to Merseyside to face Liverpool in the Premier League. Of the aforementioned Nigeria-eligible players, only Saka has games under his belt for the first team. However, he has not been included in a match day squad yet, in the new season. Midfielder Olayinka traveled with the first team for their pre-season tour of the United States and featured in the friendlies against Colorado Rapids and Fiorentina. Balogun, 18, has been promoted to first team training on the back of his fine form for the Gunners U23 squad, where he netted three goals in his first two games in the Premier League 2.
