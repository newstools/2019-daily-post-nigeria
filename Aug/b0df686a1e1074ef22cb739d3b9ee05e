Anambra indigenes living in India have expressed worry over the rising number of Nigerian girls brought into the country for prostitution, saying that the anomaly has reached its height. Mr Ikenna Aniagboso, a member Anambra Association in New Delhi, India, stated this in a recent radio interview, monitored by DAILY POST. Aniagboso, who spoke on Anambra Broadcasting Service, ABS, said most young girls of between 14 and 18 years were being trafficked into India under the guise of giving them jobs, but they end up as prostitutes. He said, “This new trend is giving Anambra people living in India a cause for concern. Almost on a daily basis, young girls are rescued and taken to the Nigerian Embassy in New Delhi. “That is why we decided to come home to enlighten our people not to fall for scams by some human traffickers who promise parents job for their daughters, only to take them to India for prostitution. “Indians like black women, and you know that especially here in Anambra, our women have full shapes that excite Indians. The new trend among Indians is that once they bring a black girl home, they call their friends to come and join them. This is so humiliating for we who live and work genuinely there.” Aniagboso said that in most cases, the trafficked girls are made to keep working until the person that brought them to the country has recovered their expenses made on them and also made profit of a million Naira, before the girl is allowed to work for themselves. He called on the state governnent to also intervene, while calling for strict interrogation by parents before accepting to give away their mature daughters to be take abroad.
