Councillors of Girei Local Government Council in Adamawa State have summoned the Chairman of the Council to react on allegations of gross misconduct levelled against him. The Chairman, Bello Wudini, who is on a temporary appointment as head of the Transition Committee of the Girei Local Government Area, is to appear before the councillors today. Wudini is alleged to have been executing capital projects without approval from the councillors as provided for in the guidelines for their operations. Governor Ahmadu Fintiri had only in July inaugurated the Girei Transition Committee, along with transition committees for each of the other 20 LGAs of the state, to hold forth pending council elections, now scheduled for November. The councillors alleged that the Girei transitional chairman violated outright some points of the interim operational guidelines as handed down to them by Gov Fintiri. They alleged that he had severally abused point 16 of the guidelines stipulating that the Chairman can approve the sum of N250,000.00, beyond which he should refer to council for consideration. They claimed that he had been operating as if he is above the law, and that he embarked on rehabilitation of road projects in Dakri, Jobbore and then Hayin Gada-Labondo road without informing the council, let alone seeking their approval. Leader of the council and Councillor representing Damare Ward, Yoila Azizi, confirmed that he formally communicated with the transitional chairman over the call for his appearance to address the allegations.
