Leicester City striker, Jamie Vardy has described Chelsea midfielder, N’Golo Kante as an ‘adorable’ person to play alongside. Vardy, a former teammate with Kante at Leicester, also revealed that the Foxes squad once had to convince the France 2018 World Cup winner not to run to training. The England star stated this ahead of Leicester City’s Premier League clash against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday. “What a pleasure it was to play alongside N’Golo!” Vardy told L’Equipe. “He is an adorable guy alongside being a fantastic footballer: when we lost the ball, wherever that happened on the pitch, boom, he would appear and win it back for us. “In training, it was so easy for him that I was convinced that he intentionally gave the ball away sometimes just to enjoy winning it back again. “One day he said to us that he was seriously considering running to the training centre each day, which came from the fact that he would always add a little running session for himself. “In the moment, we were all a bit taken aback and convinced him not to. In any case, each time that we saw him arrive at training with his Mini Cooper, we were reassured. “Last month, after our match at Stamford Bridge, he came to say hello to us in the dressing room,” Vardy added. “The first thing that I asked him was: ‘Are you still driving your Mini Cooper, mate?’ He said to me that he had sent the model that he had at Leicester back to France but that he had bought a new Mini Cooper in the meantime!” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
