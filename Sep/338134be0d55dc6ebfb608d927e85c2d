Inter Milan manager, Antonio Conte has warned his players against letting the hype about them being favourites for Serie A glory this season make them lose focus. Having overcome Udinese 1-0 , the Nerazzurri have now won three out of three games in the league and moved to the top of the table, where they sit two points ahead of Juventus. Conte, however, warned his players to block out premature thoughts of a Series A glory as they seek to end the hegemony of the Juve and clinch their first Scudetto since 2010. “We are growing and I’m happy about our maturation,” Conte told Goal.com “But I also know that now you talk about us so you can beat us when something goes wrong. “Today we talk about Inter as Juventus’ main rivals. I know the game and it is what it is. “But we have to keep our feet on the ground. Let others talk, we must shut up and work.” While Inter secured victory on Saturday, Juventus could only pick up a point against Fiorentina and Conte’s counterpart Maurizio Sarri was unhappy with having to play in the afternoon.
