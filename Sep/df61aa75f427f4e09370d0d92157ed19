Police escorting Borno State Governor, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum Friday repelled an ambush staged by suspected Boko Haram insurgents at about 6:30pm between Bama and Konduga Local Government Areas in the northeast region. According to some police escort, they successfully repelled the ambush and there was no casualty on their side. ” They could not get the governor, ” one of the security escorts said, “It was the last police vehicle that was attacked after the governor passed. But we dealt with them and dispersed and cleared the road before joining the convoy in Konduga.” Government officials and politicians who were part of the convoy told DAILY POST that, they arrived Maiduguri at about 9:00 pm on Thursday owing to the failed ambush by Boko Haram. “The governor decided to visit the Southern Borno area to check on some of the ongoing projects to ensure their completion and to be able to present something to the good people of Borno State in his 100 days in office. “So, we went round to some of the local government and on our way coming, we left Bama and heading to Konduga when the Boko Haram tried to stop us,” one of the politicians, who did not want his name mentioned said. According to him, the governor did not want such news to be escalated as it would encourage the insurgents to continue with such evil ways. The government is yet to make a statement to the effect. It could be recalled that Boko Haram fighters earlier attacked military locations at Gajiram at about 4:30 pm, Mafa-Dikwa road at about 1:40pm, Banki in Bama local government area and Konduga at about 12:30 am of late Wednesday and early morning of Thursday. Although the military is yet to also make any statement to that effect, reports from locals said the insurgents carted away some military vehicles during the attacks.
