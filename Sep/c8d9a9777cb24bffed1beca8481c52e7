Chelsea left-back, Emerson Palmieri, limped off after just seven minutes of Italy’s Euro 2020 qualifier at Finland on Sunday night. The 25-year-old, who has been in good form for Frank Lampard’s side so far this season, started alongside Blues team-mate Jorginho. But he was replaced by Roma’s Alessandro Florenzi with the game in its early stages. This news will come as a blow to Blues boss Frank Lampard, as Emerson has been in superb form for the Premier League side. His fine performances have seen him open talks over a new contract at Stamford Bridge. Emerson will likely be replaced in Chelsea’s starting XI by 28-year-old Marcos Alonso, who has dropped down the pecking order this season.
