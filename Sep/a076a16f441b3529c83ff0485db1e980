Chief Mimi Orubibi, APC candidate, who lost the Benue North-East senatorial election to her PDP rival, Sen. Gabriel Suswam, has vowed to challenge the election tribunal’s verdict that affirmed Suswam’s victory. Orubibi, in a statement on Friday in Makurdi, however, said that she was bound by the judgment “as a democrat and a law abiding citizen”. “I am bound by the judgment, but I will appeal against it. The judiciary will surely give me justice at the end of the day. My supporters should remain calm as we continue the battle. “I remain committed to the recovery of our stolen mandate and will take every legitimate and democratic pathway to do that. “It is not over until it is over. I urge all my supporters to remain law abiding and responsible citizens of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” she said. Orubibi also commended the Election Petitions Tribunal for delivering judgment within the prescribed time, NAN reports. “Considering the quality and volume of experts, oral and documentary evidences competently and professionally placed before the Tribunal, we commend it for delivering judgment within the prescribed period. “I have requested my lawyers to peruse the text of the judgment so as to determine our next step which could include the possibility of lodging an appeal against the judgment. “In view of the challenges confronting our country, especially Benue, this democratic imperative is commendable. Those who aspire to democratic leadership must conduct themselves within the democratic milieu,” she said.
