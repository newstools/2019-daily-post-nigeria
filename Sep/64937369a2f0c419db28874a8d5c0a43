AliBaba, on his Instagram page wondered what Buhari can do in such a situation when issue of killings within Nigeria was yet to be solved. He cited a past occurrence where Nigeria sanctioned MTN and it resulted in a Presidential visit from the president. Ali Baba wrote: “Most times, some people just read the news hear the news, and do not know the undercurrents of the news. Many do not know the interconnections of the nexus of any news they hear. “Shebi they say I’m a comedian… Ok. Let our president pull some strings, that South African President, who has not been able to stop the xenophobic craze, will be made by those who own the big South African businesses in Nigeria, to come down, in less than 2 weeks. “But when we have a President that cannot take decisive action when people are being killed like flies in his country, what will he say when it happens outside Nigeria? “If we have a good country what would we be doing in another man’s country to warrant xenophobic attacks? Fix Nigeria.” Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed “deep concern,” over the attacks on Nigerian citizens and property in South Africa A statement by Buhari’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina said Buhari has despatched special envoy to his South African counterpart, President Cyril Ramaphosa. “The Special Envoy is expected to arrive in Pretoria latest Thursday, September 5, 2019.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
