Former Newcastle striker, Alan Shearer, has praised ‘warrior’ Matteo Guendouzi, after the midfielder inspired a second-half turnaround in Arsenal’s win over Aston Villa. Shearer also praised the Gunners’ substitutions, after 10-man Arsenal twice came from behind to beat Aston Villa 3-2 at the Emirates on Sunday. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a late winner after the Gunners twice had to equalise, with Villa strikes from John McGinn and Wesley cancelled out by a Nicolas Pepe penalty and a goal from substitute Calum Chambers. “The change in their attitude was incredible in the second half. “Saka came off and Chambers on, they committed men forward and played with more pace. The intent was really there. “It started from Guendouzi, he was magnificent. “They needed a warrior and he stood up. “We have questioned Arsenal’s character so we have to give them praise when they do well. “Unai Emery’s substitutions worked perfectly,” Shearer said on BBC’s Match of the Day.
