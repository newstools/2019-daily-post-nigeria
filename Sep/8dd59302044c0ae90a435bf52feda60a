Dauda Birmah, a former Minister of Education in late Gen. Sani Abacha’s regime and a former presidential candidate, has kicked against plans by certain political forces to retain power in the North when the tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari expires. DAILY POST reported recently that some Northern leaders such as the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, argued that zoning should be jettisoned in 2023. Birmah said power should shift to the South in the spirit of equity and fairness and that the region should be allowed to decide by themselves which zone produces the next President. “Nigeria as it stands today and with the sharp differences, we should maintain the rotational presidency, ” he was quoted by Sun. “I am not in favour of micro zoning either in the South or in the North. If we zone it to the South, Northerners should keep quiet and allow the people to decide for themselves and the same thing for the North. “There is a dangerous tendency of people advocating for the principle of entitlement. Entitlement stops at North-South dichotomy. “If you say you’re going to get involved and go for micro zoning, you will be encouraging laziness and some form of entitlement. “The rotational arrangements between the two regions should be encouraged. For now, there is this deep suspicion. “I am from the North East and I am one of those saying that we have not had a president since the time of Tafawa Balewa. “This argument should be made within the context of zoning power to the North. When we make this argument, we should shut out the South. “The North should talk to itself and the South should talk to itself too. When it’s time to pick another Northerner after the South may have served out its term, “we will talk to ourselves. We explain to North West and Central why we deserve to produce the next president.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
