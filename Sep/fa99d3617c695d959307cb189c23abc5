PSG manager, Thomas Tuchel, is hoping Kylian Mbappe and Neymar can forge a deadly partnership this season. Speaking at a news conference on Friday, Tuchel confirmed both Mbappe and loanee Mauro Icardi, are available again after recent injuries. The PSG boss is all too aware that if Mbappe and Neymar can combine consistently, the reigning Ligue 1 champions will take some stopping. “The relationship between the two is the key for us, they can bring us a lot of possibilities. “Mbappe has been hurt for weeks, we have to be patient, and tomorrow it’s impossible for Kylian to play 90 minutes. “We have to adapt to the situation and the opponent. Tomorrow, we will be able to play Mbappe and Icardi,” Tuchel said. Wednesday’s 2-0 loss to Reims was PSG’s first home defeat in Ligue 1 since May 2018, before Tuchel took charge. The loss leaves the Parisians clinging to top spot, only ahead of Angers on goal difference, with Tuchel eager for his side to set things right on Saturday against Bordeaux. “It’s a good thing to play quickly after the loss. “It’s always hard to find a good mood after a setback – it’s the challenge tomorrow against a good team from Bordeaux, to start winning again. “It was a lack of intensity. It was a surprise for me because I made some changes to have intensity. “I hate to lose, it was super hard. We can do better and we’ll improve,” he added.
