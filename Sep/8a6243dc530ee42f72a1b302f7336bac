Members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) otherwise known as Shi’ites on Thursday buried four of their members that were allegedly killed by the police on Tuesday in Bauchi State capital during the ‘Ashura’ procession.
DAILY POST gathered that the procession was disrupted following a clash between the police and the sect members as police hurled teargas and shot some of the Shi’ites. Speaking shortly after the funeral prayer for the deceased held at Kobi football field, Bauchi, State leader of the sect Malam Ahmad Yusuf Yashi represented by his disciple Malam Zilkallaini Aliyu revealed that the slain members were; Uzaifa Adamu, Hussaini Haruna, Uzaifa Sunusi and Ahmed (surname withheld). He said their members were staging peaceful rally when police allegedly attacked them shooting and stabbing the demonstrators around Bauchi Central market which resulted to the death of four persons aged 16 to 20 years. Yashi lamented that if other Muslims sects and faithfuls of other religions could be allowed to practice their faiths without hindrance, shi’ites should also not be persecuted. According to him, they have been conducting rallies for over 20 years without violence saying the attack on the members was uncalled for.
