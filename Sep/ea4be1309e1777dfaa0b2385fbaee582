Arsenal have struck an agreement with Spanish second division side, Huesca, which will see them given the first option to re-sign Kelechi Nwakali. Nwakali signed a three-year deal with Huesca on transfer deadline day, after failing to feature for the Gunenrs since he joined them in 2016. The Super Eagles midfielder has had loan spells with MVV Maastricht, VVV Venlo and Porto B team. “Arsenal is my dream club. I have joined Huesca so as to get enough playing time and be back on track (with my career). “And one thing is sure, it’s not over yet for me at Arsenal because there’s a buy-back option in my contract as well. “At the end of the contract, it will be whether I’m going back to Arsenal or moving on from there,” the 21-year-old told journalists in Asaba, ahead of the U-23 team’s Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match second leg clash against Sudan.
