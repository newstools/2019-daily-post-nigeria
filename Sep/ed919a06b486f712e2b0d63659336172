Kieran Tierney finally played a game in an Arsenal shirt, as he turned out for the U-23 team on Friday. The Scottish defender joined the Gunners in a £25m deal from Celtic, but has been in rehabilitation, after undergoing surgery last season. Tierney played an hour, as the Gunners’ youngsters faced off against their Wolves counterparts. He was joined in the Arsenal starting line-up by Hector Bellerin, who has been out of action since January. The right-back suffered a serious knee injury against Chelsea, but has stepped up his comeback. Both players got an hour on the pitch, with Bellerin looking the more comfortable of the pair. Manager Unai Emery confirmed Tierney and Bellerin would play for the U-23s, following his side’s victory over Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League.
