Manchester United may likely be without defender, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, when they tackle Leicester City in the Premier League fixture on September 14 at Old Trafford. According to Metro UK, Wan-Bissaka was withdrawn from England’s squad for Euro 2020 qualifiers against Bulgaria and Kosovo on September 7 and 10 respectively after sustaining a back injury. Wan-Bissaka received his first call-up to Gareth Southgate’s squad for the games against Bulgaria and Kosovo following an impressive start to his Manchester United career. He will now be replaced by Trent Alexander-Arnold or Kieran Trippier at England’s right-back position. The 21-year-old has started all four of Manchester United’s games so far this campaign.
