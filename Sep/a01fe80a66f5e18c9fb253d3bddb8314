The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Imo West has rejected the ruling of the election petition tribunal on the March 9, 2019 senatorial election in the area. The party described the ruling as unacceptable, miscarriage of justice and a rape on democracy. DAILY POST reports that the tribunal sitting in Abuja had sustained the declaration of the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Okorocha, as the winner of the poll. Speaking to newsmen in Owerri yesterday, Imo West PDP chairman, Chief Alloy Igwe, insisted that the election was marred by violence and irregularities and as such should not have stood. He said the party would stand behind its candidate, Jones Onyeriri, to seek a better judgement at the Court of Appeal that would represent the true mandate of the people. “We feel very bad over the judgement. We look at it as one that has deprived people of their right of participation in politics. It is a rape of people’s representation,” he said.
