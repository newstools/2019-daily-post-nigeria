A driver, Abiodun Makinde, who the police said is “a member of ‘one chance’ robbery syndicate, terrorising commuters along Sango/Owode/Idiroko road”, has been arrested. The Ogun State Police Command said the suspect was arrested on September 13, following a distress call made by two of his victims, Gloria Edoh and Saidat Akinola, who complained that they both boarded a cab from Owode to Sango in Ogun. But on getting to Olokopupo area of Atan Ota, two men they met in the car suddenly brought out knives and other dangerous weapons with which they forced them to surrender their belongings. The sum of N37,000 and N480,000 was collected from each of them, as well as their Tecno phones, after which they were pushed out of the moving vehicle, consequent upon which they sustained various degrees of injuries, DAILY POST learnt from the police. The Spokesperson of Ogun Police, Abimbola Oyeyemi said the victims “subsequently found their way to a nearby hospital for treatment. But while coming from the hospital, they sighted and identified Abiodun Makinde as one of the hoodlums who robbed them, hence they raised alarm. “The alarm they raised attracted the DPO Atan Ota, SP Abiodun Salau, who was on routine patrol of the area with his men and they raced to the scene where the suspect was arrested with the help of members of the public.” Oyeyemi said, “On getting to the station, one woman (name withheld), who had earlier complained of similar incident also identified the suspect as one of the hoodlums who robbed and raped her on the 12th of September and made away with her pants.” The suspect, it was gathered, had confessed to participating in the two robbery incidents. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, Bashir Makama, had ordered the transfer of the suspect to the Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS) for discreet investigation.
