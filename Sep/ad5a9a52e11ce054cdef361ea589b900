Super Eagles midfielder, John Ogu, has urged Chelsea striker, Tammy Abraham to represent Nigeria over England because of the array of talents in the national team. Abraham’s international future remains a subject of discussion among pundits and coaches due to his eligibility to represent either Nigeria or England.  Abraham has featured in two friendly matches for England against Germany and Brazil in 2017 but he is still eligible to represent the Super Eagles of Nigeria in the future. But Ogu now wants Abraham, who scored a hat-trick in Chelsea’s 5-2 victory over Wolves in the Premier League on Saturday, to play for his fatherland ahead of his birth country, England. According to him, Abraham will form a formidable partnership with Lille’s Victor Osimhen in the Super Eagles’ attack line. “With the bunch of talents we have in the Super Eagles, Tammy Abraham or every Nigerian-born player outside will want to represent their fatherland,” Ogu wrote on Twitter. “Imagine Super Eagles go 4-4-2 with Victor Osimhen and Tammy Abraham upfront.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
