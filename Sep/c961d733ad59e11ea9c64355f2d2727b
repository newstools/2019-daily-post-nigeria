Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper, Hugo Lloris, has admitted they don’t have a chance of winning the Premier League title this season, because something is “missing” from the team. Mauricio Pochettino’s team finished fourth last campaign and reached the final of the Champions League, where they were beaten 2-0 by Liverpool. But they were a staggering 27 points behind Manchester City, who won the title and 26 points behind Liverpool, who finished runners up. Lloris, speaking with Sky Sports, predicted Tottenham will once again finish way short of the duo. “Liverpool and Man City have the experience and they are really competitive. “I think, at the moment, there’s something missing from us. We will see later in the season because things turn very quickly in football. “The most important thing is we focus on ourselves, to get points, to get consistency in the league. And we will see where we are in the table in April, in March. “That is the moment when you can win or lose European places or trophies. At the moment, we don’t want to lose focus with that type of question,” Lloris said.
