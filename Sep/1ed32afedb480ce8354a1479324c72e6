The Nigerian Government on Thursday said it was not aware that the South African foreign missions in Nigeria has been shutdown. The South African Foreign Affairs Minister, Naledi Pandor was reported to have said that the country had temporarily closed its embassy in Nigeria, adding that there was no plan by her country to pay compensation to those affected by the attacks. She said South Africa was in constant touch with Nigerian authorities to try to restore calm. However, briefing State House correspondents on Thursday, Foreign Affairs Minister, Geoffrey Onyeama said, “We are not aware that the South African government has closed down its High Commission here in Abuja or its Consulate in Lagos.” The Minister insisted that the President Muhammadu Buhari administration must go ahead to press for compensation on the attacks and destruction of the businesses of Nigerians in South Africa. He explained that “inviting Nigeria’s High Commissioner to South Africa would help the Nigerian government get the necessary information on the recent attacks on Nigerians in South Africa.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
