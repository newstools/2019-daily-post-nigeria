Mavin Producer, Don Jazzy and fans of the Big brother Naija reality show on Sunday reacted as housemate, Frood emerged winner of the Ultimate veto power game of chance. DAILY POST recalls that Frodd emerged winner after he picked four random pictures, one of which matched the exact duplicate inside the veto power box. Biggie had said the housemate that picked the exact duplicate with the one inside the box would emerge winner. Ebuka also added that the winner will nominate five housemates for possible eviction on Monday. This means five housemates will be up for eviction next week. Reacting, some Nigerians described Frodd as a child of grace. Here are some comments DAILY POST gathered: @Donjazzy, “Frodd has grace sha.” Zaddy_nomso, “The Night Frodd was to go there was fake eviction which made them evict just one person, he escaped severally & became stronger week by week & he has now won the Ultimate Veto Power.
