Gunmen have allegedly killed Rev. Alhamdu Mangadus, a resident pastor of Nasara Baptist Church, Asso Community in Jema’a Local Government area of Kaduna State. The pastor, according to a source, was killed today (Wednesday) afternoon while in his farm. The source said the gunmen alleged to be Fulani militias were said to have opened fire on the pastor while he was working in the farm at around 1pm. Efforts to get the council chairman, Jema’a local government area, Mr Peter Danjuma Averik, to comment on the incident proved abortive as he did not respond to phone calls put to him at the time of filing this report.
