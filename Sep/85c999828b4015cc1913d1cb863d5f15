Former BBN housemate, Uti Uwachukwu, has given reason Nigerians should vote for BBNaija housemate, Mike. Four housemates: Khafi, Tacha, Mike and Seyi have been nominated for possible eviction this week. Omashola, who was nominated but had the veto power card, replaced himself with Seyi. At least one of the aforementioned housemates will be evicted on Sunday during live BBNaija eviction show. Uti, speaking on nominated housemates for eviction, urged Nigerians to vote for Mike in order to promote hope and progress. According to him, housemate like Mike needs to stay back in the reality show to serve as role models to influence and inspire Nigerian youths. On his Twitter page, Uti wrote: “At times like these when manners and integrity are endangered amongst our youth. We need great role models for Nigeria. “Positive role models with substance that will influence and inspire our youth. “Someone that promotes hope and progress mixed with success. Vote Mike.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
