The presiding pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ Gospel Church, Adewale Giwa has accused the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari of turning the nation’s democracy into a tool of oppression. He said this in a statement Friday night in reaction to the continued detention of Mr. Omoyele Sowore by the Department of State Services, DSS. According to him, the “cabal” was yet to give the DSS permission to free the journalist. Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja had ruled that the previous order issued to detain Sowore for 45 days, had elapsed and ordered his release. Giwa said: “To me, I am not surprised that Sowore has not been released. When I read that the court had set him free, I knew that Sowore won’t be released until they get the directive from ‘cabal’ who determine the nation’s fate currently. “Since 2015 till date, this government has turned Nigeria’s democracy into an oligarchy. A small group of people are the ones controlling the affairs of this nation. I have said it that Nigerians would have reasons to glorify God after the exit of Buhari. “No amount of protests can change the mind of this government led by president Buhari; all we need to do now is to endure, and the Lord will have mercy on this nation soonest,” Giwa stated.
