Paris Saint-Germain manager, Thomas Tuchel, has insisted that forward, Neymar, did everything possible to leave the club before the European transfer window closed. PSG have retained the Brazil superstar despite strong speculation he would leave, two years after joining from Barca for a world-record €222million fee. Neymar heavily linked with Barcelona and their LaLiga rivals Real Madrid, amid rumours the player offered up to €20million of his own money, to facilitate a transfer back to the Spanish champions. There has long been speculation Neymar regretted his decision to leave Barca in 2017 and Tuchel has now confirmed it was a relief for Neymar even though it was against his wishes. “You could feel that, and I can understand if the fans are angry, even permanently,” Tuchel told DAZN ahead of PSG’s UEFA Champions League clash against Real Madrid on Wednesday. “Nevertheless, there is also a side between me as a coach and him [Neymar] as a player. There was never a break or a discrepancy. That’s why it was very easy for me to let him play. He has always trained professionally. “I feel that the decision was a relief to him, even though it was against his wishes. “Then, one is automatically focused on the task. As an athlete there is not much else you can think about. You have to give your all. He is hungry and a competitive guy who always wants to win. “He has to withstand it [the boos and whistles from the fans] now, that’s the reality. He has to go through it, and we all have to go through it in the home games. The best thing is to come to terms with it.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
