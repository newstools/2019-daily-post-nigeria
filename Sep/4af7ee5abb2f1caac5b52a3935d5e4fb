Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate Mercy has bought her way to the semi finals of the reality show. Big Brother on Monday night gave the housemates first opportunity to make purchase with the coins they received in the reality show. Diane booked a spa session with Elozonam, while Mercy begged for more coins from Mike and bought immunity from eviction next week. This means that Mercy will not be nominated for possible eviction next week. DAILY POST recalls that the organisers of BBNaija on Sunday announced a new twist to the game. Official host of BBNaija, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu during eviction show on Sunday, announced that eviction has been cancelled for this week.
