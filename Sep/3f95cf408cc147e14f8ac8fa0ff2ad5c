Liverpool face being disqualified from the Carabao Cup, as the EFL has opened an investigation into the eligibility of one of the players, they fielded against MK Dons on Wednesday. Jurgen Klopp fielded a much-changed starting XI in midweek, as the Reds beat the League Two side 2-0 in their third round tie. However, one of those included, 22-year-old Pedro Chirivella, may not have met the registration criteria, which is related to an International Transfer Certificate issue. The EFL has the authority to fine or eject the club from the competition altogether. Liverpool have issued an official statement on the matter. “The club are aware of a potential administrative issue pertaining to one of our players. “We are working with the relevant authorities in order to establish the facts of the matter and will be making no further comment until this process is complete,” it said.
