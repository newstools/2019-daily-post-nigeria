Obinna Onwubuariri (of the Peoples Democratic Party – PDP), a member of the House of Representatives, has been sacked. This is as the National Assembly Elections Petitions Tribunal in Owerri on Wednesday ordered the withdrawal of his certificate of return. Onwubuariri is representing Isiala Mbano/Onuimo/Okigwe federal constituency of Imo State. The Tribunal chairman, R. Harriman, also directed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct a fresh poll in the constituency within 90 days. He held that the petitioner, Princess Miriam Onuoha, of the All Progressives Congress (PDP) was able to prove her grounds which included over-voting, mutilation of figures, and the reduction of her votes.
