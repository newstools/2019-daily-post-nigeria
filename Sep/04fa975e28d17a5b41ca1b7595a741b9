Strong indications emerged last night that pressures were beginning to mount on some of the aspirants of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), for the 2019 party’s primaries, to step down for Governor Dickson’s preferred candidate. The first to throw the shocker was the immediate past Chief of staff to the current governor, Hon. Talford Ongolo, who stepped down after series of meeting with his kinsmen in his own town in Oporoma, Southern Ijaw Local government area, of Bayelsa state. DAILY POST gathered from a source that the Ex-chief of staff had negotiations with Dickson for a reappointment, reimbursement for monies spent on his campaign and a possible replacement as the Senator for Bayelsa central if his preferred candidate becomes the governor. Another source, revealed that Ongolo stepped down out of the governorship race because of his open rejection by his kinsmen during his visit to canvass for the votes of delegates from the area. Other indications of the new development that became visible after the state governor’s orders to stakeholders of his restoration camp in all the eight local government areas of the state was the gale of endorsement on the current Senator representing Bayelsa central senatorial district, Hon. Douye Diri. DAILY POST, also learnt that there’s total rejection to the choice of Dickson’s preferred candidate within the fold of the party, other stakeholders and majority of their supporters who have vowed to either decamp or work against the party if his(Dickson’s) wish prevailed. Other political pundits, and commentators are of the opinion that over fifteen other aspirants allegedly sponsored by the governor will also step down for Senator Douye Diri.
