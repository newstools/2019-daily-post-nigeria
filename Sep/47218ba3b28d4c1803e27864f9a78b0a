Arsenal managing director, Vinai Venkatesham, has publicly supported manager, Unai Emery, as pressure increases on the Spaniard, following a string of poor performances. The Gunners were held to a 2-2 draw against Watford and were lucky to leave Vicarage Road with a point, having given away a two-goal lead. But Venkatesham has insisted that the club’s hierarchy remain satisfied with job done by Emery. “Absolutely, we are very comfortable with him and his coaching staff. “We think he is doing an excellent job, so we are very happy,” he told The Straits Times. Venkatesham went on to explain the qualities they were looking out for before Emery was hired. “We want a coach who was willing, able and had a track record of playing young players, because that is an important part of Arsenal Football Club. “First, it is financially efficient. The more players you have coming from the academy, the more funds you can then use to invest in the transfer window because you then have a budget that is being stretched among fewer players. “More important than that is we want players in the dressing room who really understand what it means to play for Arsenal, players who have grown up with the club,” he added.
