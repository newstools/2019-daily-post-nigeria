Sunday who lives in Muslim-Odinjo area in Ibadan said he cannot live with his wife anymore because her mother, was solidly behind her daughter’s immorality and arrogance. He said, “I have pleaded with Fumito to change her adulterous lifestyle, disobedience and arrogance, but she has gotten worse. ”She told me that she was bored with me. She said I can go out and look for any woman I want. She starves me of sex. ”I caught her in a compromising position with another man.” However, Fumito, prayed the court not to grant her husband’s prayer for divorce. She said ”My husband is the adulterer. He has slept with four of my apprentices. Sunday is also abusive.” Chief Henry Agbaje, the court’s President, said that there was need for the couple to produce their relatives and three children in court. He adjourned the case until Sept. 17, for them to provide more proofs to substantiate their arguments.
