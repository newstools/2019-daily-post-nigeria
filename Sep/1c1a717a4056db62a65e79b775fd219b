England boss, Gareth Southgate, has advised Tammy Abraham to reject the overtures of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) and stick with his country of birth. Abraham was first approached by the Super Eagles in 2017, but insisted he was waiting for his chance with the Three Lions. However, it is a big challenge for the Chelsea striker, to get into the present England squad as he is behind Harry Kane, Marcus Rashford and Callum Wilson in the pecking order. But Southgate has hinted that he is up for consideration for their upcoming matches. “Tammy is a young player that we’ve always liked, we know he’ll score goals. “We felt it was a bit early this time to call him up, but we really can see that he can offer us something moving forward. “We gave him a cap back in November of 2017. “For sure, we need to make certain that he feels that the opportunity is going to be there. I’m pretty sure he does, he knows us well enough,” Southgate was quoted as saying by Daily Express.
