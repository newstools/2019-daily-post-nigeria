Prophet T.B. Joshua, founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations, SCOAN, has reacted to the renewed xenophobic attack on Nigerians in South Africa. Speaking during Sunday’s service at the church’s headquarters in Lagos State, Joshua urged Africans to be united. T.B. Joshua, who shed tears during the service said: “If we cannot understand ourselves as Africans, how will other continents understand us. “Dear Africans, we should not let fellow Africans feel unwelcomed in our countries. “The world should know that every country has their challenges. The wound of one should be the wound of all. “Africa unite, we have a common enemy. Let’s us come together and fight the one enemy that has camouflage itself.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
