Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has called on his team to embark on a winning run, so they can overtake their top-four rivals. United host Leicester on Saturday, after picking up just two points from their last three games. Crystal Palace, West Ham and Everton are all above them in the table, as are Leicester. Solskjaer has not been helped by a major injury crisis, with Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial, Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot all out, while Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Jesse Lingard are doubts. The Norwegian is however adamant that the Red Devils, are heading in the right direction under him. “There’s always pressure when you’re here, but of course I’m ­confident in what we’re doing. “We’ve got a plan and the performances haven’t told me that we need to change direction. Results, that’s a different matter, but when you concede three goals from four chances, there’s not a lot you can control. “They’re games we should have won. We know that, but that’s ­another matter. We can control how we play, how we practise and how we prepare. “We’ve lost one game since July 1 and it sounds like we’re really struggling, but that’s just the way it is at United and you have to handle it,” Solskjaer went on. “We want to get the results we feel we deserve and now is the time to get them. We’re coming into a busy period now and we don’t want to be behind Tottenham, Chelsea or Arsenal (in the race for the top four). “There’s Leicester and Everton too. There are loads of teams who want to get in there. We need to make sure we get on a winning streak and get the results,” Solskjaer told the media ahead of Saturday’s game against Leicester.
