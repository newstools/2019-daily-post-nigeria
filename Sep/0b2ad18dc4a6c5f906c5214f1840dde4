The Senate Committee on the Diaspora and Non-Governmental Organisations has decided to invite the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to seek an end to the xenophobic attacks against Nigerians by South Africans. Chairman of the committee, Senator Ajibola Basiru, in a statement on Friday, said: “it has become very urgent to take decisive action in putting an end to brazen and fatal attacks on Nigerians in all parts of the world.” Basiru, representing Osun Central Senatorial District, warned that “the incessant bloodshed could snowball into a conflagration with dire consequences for the two countries if the Nigerian and South African governments do not take prompt and urgent steps to end.” He further said that there was the need for the Federal Government to take, “decisive actions to ease the tension of Nigerians at home and relieve the suffering of those in South Africa in the hands of local miscreants and hoodlums parading themselves as patriots to annihilate Nigerians.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
