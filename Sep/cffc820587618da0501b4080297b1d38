Manchester United midfielder, Juan Mata has identified Leicester City striker, Jamie Vardy as the dangerous player that could hurt Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men when they tackle the Foxes in the Premier League this weekend at Old Trafford. The Spaniard believes that Vardy will be the player Man United will need to be wary of on Saturday. Man United head to the game after playing a 1-1 draw with Southampton in their last Premier League encounter. “Since Leicester won the Premier League, they have been adding and losing players, but always keeping that level, so they will be dangerous,” Mata was quoted by Man United’s official website as saying on Friday. “I think Vardy is mostly the danger,” he added. “There are a few players doing very well under this new manager, but he’s the one that stands out.“ The kick-off time for the match is 3pm.
