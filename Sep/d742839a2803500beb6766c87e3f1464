Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, was delighted with Rob Holding’s “perfect” return, as they reached the Carabao Cup last-16, with a comprehensive 5-0 victory over Nottingham Forest. Returning duo Holding and Bellerin impressed on a memorable night at the Emirates, alongside summer signing Kieran Tierney. Gabriel Martinelli scored a brace, while Reiss Nelson, Joe Willock and Holding also got on the scoresheet. Asked about Holding’s return, Emery told reporters after the game: “It is perfect to have more options at centre back. “His spirit, his positive minutes. Every day in training he helps us to have more performances like a team. “He needed to take minutes and confidence. It was a perfect match. He was a little tired at the end, he’s happy.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
