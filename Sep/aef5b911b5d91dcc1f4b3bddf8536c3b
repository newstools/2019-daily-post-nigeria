The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide has described President Muhammadu Buhari’s victory at the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal as a reaffirmation of the mandate given to him by Nigerians on February 23rd, 2019. This was contained in a statement signed by Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, its President-General on Thursday. The group urged the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar to accept the outcome of the petition, “even though he has the constitutional rights to appeal the decision of the Presidential tribunal at the Supreme Court.” He noted that the validation of President Buhari’s mandate “is the shortest route to have an Igbo man as President in 2023. “It’s historic that during 2003 Presidential campaign when the then General Muhammadu Buhari was the flag bearer of ANPP with late Senator Chuba Okadigbo in Umuahia, during the 2003 ANPP gubernatorial flag-off campaign of Chief Enyinnaya Abaribe, Buhari had said ‘I’m destined to be the man that will hand over to an Igbo man as President’, 20 years later, by 2023, the prophecy is sure to be accomplished.” Isiguzoro, however, called on President Buhari to give massive projects and empowerment to the South East as a prompt response to those who believe that “he’s tribalistic, and hates Igbos. “He should reward the South East with projects and we urge Igbos to work towards getting Nigeria President of Igbo stock in 2023 by being less critical of him; it is time to genuinely build bridges ahead of 2023.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
