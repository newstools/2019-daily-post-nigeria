A former spiritual leader of Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo, founder of Commonwealth of Zion Assembly, COZA, Reverend Emmanuel Oset, has revealed why he ended his relationship with the controversial clergyman. Oset, who is the Senior Pastor of Canan Ministry in Ilorin, Kwara State disclosed that he ended his relationship with Fatoyinbo due to allegations of adultery leveled against the COZA pastor by his former church member Ese Walters in 2013. He made the revelation while reacting to the rape allegation against Fatoyinbo by wife of popular singer, Timi Dakolo, Busola Dakolo. Speaking on Arise Television yesterday, Oset disclosed that he became Fatoyinbo’s spiritual mentor after the COZA pastor reached out to him to pray for him and he became his spiritual father. According to Oset: “I had been Fatoyinbo’s spiritual mentor for years and have had to wade in when similar allegations were made against him. “I investigated and the evidence against him was overwhelming but at the end, he promised that he would change. “I had to cut off from him after a member of his church accused him in 2013 of having an extramarital affair. “When that incident happened, I called him and told him that I wanted us to talk, but he kept avoiding me for many months. “From August 2013 to April 2014, I kept putting pressure on him to come so we could discuss the issue but he avoided me. So I had to write him a letter telling him that I was no longer interested in being his mentor.” Watch video:  Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
