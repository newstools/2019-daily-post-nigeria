The All Progressives Congress (APC) has appealed to Nigerians to be careful of persons scheming division in the country. The ruling party said this in its message on the country’s 59th Independence Anniversary. Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, APC National Publicity Secretary, in a statement on Monday, hailed Nigeria’s founding fathers who fought for independence as well as members of the Armed Forces, who have paid the supreme sacrifice to defend the country’s territorial integrity and unity. He said: “As a nation, we are better together than we are apart. Hence, we must be wary of those who hide under religion, politics, tribe and sundry groupings to turn us against one another. Despite our perceived differences, our strength and progress depends on our ability to harness our rich diversity. “In spite of the inherited and our current challenges, President Muhammadu Buhari administration has made commendable strides on so many fronts, most significantly the fight against graft, diversifying and revamping the economy, curbing insurgency and emerging crimes, promoting positive values in our national life, strengthening our democratic institutions and processes and achieving a respectable international standing. “Finally, we admonish well meaning Nigerians to engage in acts that would heal our fault lines by promoting ethnic and religious tolerance and peaceful coexistence, which would engender Nigeria’s growth and development. “As Africa’s most populous nation, we can do much better, given our natural resources and potential. The President Buhari administration is committed to building on and affirming our Giant of Africa status.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
