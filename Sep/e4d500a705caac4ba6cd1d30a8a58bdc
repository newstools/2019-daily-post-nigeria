Abubakar Saadu, who allegedly collected $15,000 in bitcoin as a ransom to release a kidnapped victim, Aisha Ardo, has not been arrested by security agencies. Sources at both the Police and the Department of State Services (DSS), told PRNigeria on Tuesday that investigation was ongoing. The daughter of Dr. Umar Ardo, who is a cousin to former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, was kidnapped last Saturday at a supermarket in Asokoro, Abuja. Her father had confirmed that he paid $15,000 to secure her release on Sunday night after she had spent about 30 hours with the kidnappers at a forest close to Gwarinpa District in Abuja. The security sources said images on social media claiming that the recipient of the ransom through bitcoin transaction had been arrested in Kano was false. Meanwhile, the Inspector-General of Police, IGP M.A Adamu, on Monday declared that the Federal Capital Territory is safe, secure and not under any form of siege. He said: “This assertion comes against the backdrop of recent speculations in some sections of the media, particularly the Social Media, of an upsurge in crime rate within and around the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. “Like other climes across the World, the country has its security challenges. “A comprehensive analysis of crime statistics on major cities across the world would reveal that Abuja has one of the lowest crime rates and remains indisputably one of the safest capital cities in the world. “The Federal Capital Territory Police Command has a robust anti-crime architecture which is continually rejigged to effectively tackle prevailing and emerging crimes. “I enjoin all law-abiding citizens and visitors alike to go about their lawful endeavours without any fear or apprehension”.
