Constitutional lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, has commended the ruling of an Abuja Federal High Court ordering the release of convener of RevolutionNow protest, Omoyele Sowore.
Ozekhome appealed to the Attorney-General General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, to invoke his powers under Section 174 of Nigeria’s constitution to discontinue and terminate the trial of Sowore. Recall that Sowore had called for a revolution over the alleged failure of the current Federal Government. Following the call for revolution, the Department of State Services, DSS, had arrested the former Presidential candidate of AAC and was arraigned before an Abuja Federal High Court. Despite Sowore’s arrest, the protest was held in pockets of locations.
However, the Justice Taiwo Taiwo-led Federal High Court yesterday granted Sowore bail. Reacting to the ruling, the constitutional lawyer urged the Nigerian Government to save itself from public ridicule and embarrassment by closing its case against Sowore. In a statement, he said: “My advice to the government is that they should honourably discontinue this case forthwith. “The Attorney-General of the Federation under Section 174 of the constitution can l, take up, charge and terminate any criminal proceedings against any person. “He can use his powers at this point to discontinue the case and allow Sowore to go home. “It is good that the court-ordered Sowore to be released forthwith to his lawyer. “This is how it should be so that whenever the government is desirous of arraigning Sowore, it can go ahead and arraign him.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
