Barcelona midfielder, Arda Turan, on loan with Turkish club Basaksehir, has been handed a suspended prison sentence, for firing a gun to cause fear and panic, illegal possession of weapons and intentional injury. The court sentenced Turan to two years and eight months in prison. But he will not serve that term, unless he commits a crime in the next five years. Turan was involved in a fight with Turkish singer, Berkay Sahin, in an Istanbul nightclub late last year, leaving the singer with a broken nose. The player later arrived at the hospital with a gun, which he fired at the ground, causing panic. Basaksehir said they had fined the 31-year-old 2.5 million Turkish lira over the incident.
