In a statement exclusively made available to our correspondent in Calabar, the Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Health, Dr Joseph Bassey thanked DAILY POST for exposing the evils in the health sectors. “Thanks for this investigative report. Please be assured that we are doing all we can under the circumstances. “While it is true that the state health sector is experiencing acute staff shortage in all cadres of health care, the Govt of Sir Ben Ayade as a very humane government is seriously concerned and is putting in place modalities to mitigate the effects of this on the health workforce and service delivery as a whole. “We are hopeful that soon the state health sector will experience a massive turnaround of its perceived declining fortunes” Dr Bassey stated.
