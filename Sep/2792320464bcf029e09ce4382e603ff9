Real Madrid midfielder, Casemiro has said that his side have no excuses after their humiliating Champions League 3-0 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday. According to him, the La Liga giants played below their best against Thomas Tuchel’s side in France. Two goals from Angel Di Maria and a late strike from Thomas Meunier ensured PSG defeated Zinedine Zidane’s men at Parc des Princes. “We have not played well, they [PSG] have had control of the game and we know that it is difficult to play here,” the Brazilian told Movistar. “They are very strong, they have great players. There are no excuses, we have not played well, but there is still time for many things, to keep working. “There are many things ahead.” “We always try to be aggressive, but of course when the result is 3-0 we know that things are more noticeable,” he added. “We know that if we don’t make an almost perfect match here, you don’t win. There’s a lot of time to change this.” Casemiro will hope to lead Real Madrid to victory when they take on Sevila in the La Liga this weekend.
