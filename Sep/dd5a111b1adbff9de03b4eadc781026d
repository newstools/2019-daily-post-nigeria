Italy star, Jorginho’s agent, Joao Santos has revealed how many years his client will stay at Chelsea. According to Santos, the midfielder has five years left on his current contract with Chelsea and would like to stay at Stamford Bridge for at least another four years. Jorginho has scored three goals in 59 appearances so far for Chelsea since joining the club from Napoli last year. The 27-year-old has formed a strong partnership with fellow teammate, N’Golo Kante in Chelsea midfield. “We have a mid-to-long-term project with Chelsea,” Santos told Radio Kiss Kiss Napoli. “There are five years left on his contract and let’s say he’d like to stay for at least another four years.” Jorginho will hope to lead Chelsea to victory when they take on Wolves this Saturday in the Premier League fixture.
