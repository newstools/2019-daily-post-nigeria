Reactions have continued to trail Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Cindy’s selection of Mike as companion to share the luxury room. Cindy on Monday won this week’s Head of House, HoH, challenge for the ‘Pepper Dem’ edition of the reality TV show. The position of HoH is usually assumed by the winner of the weekly task as instructed by Biggie. Cindy decided to share the luxury of the Head of House bedroom with fellow housemate and married man, Mike. Her decision has since stirred reactions from Nigerians on social media, querying Cindy’s reason for picking a married man as a companion in her luxury room. Here are some reactions gathered by DAILY POST from Twitter: @Cockt6 “Cindy chose Mike because she knows he will not honor the invitation. She wants the HOH room to herself. She’s smart.” @Maryamdolce “We the second wives association of Mike Olayemi are okay with him sharing a room with Cindy, we are learning positivity from the Queen herself aka Perri aka Mrs. Olayemi.” @Princeadekola_ “Another week for Cindy in the house. I trust Mike, nothing will happen.” @Nenyechelsea “So Cindy chose Mike to share the HOH room with her. Only if Venita wasn’t evicted yesterday, she would have gone for her instead of being that they are good friends.” @Babyfaze “Mike is a gentleman, Cindy would be in safe hands this week.” @Aderireadeoti ” This BBNaija season is the most competitive yet. Everyone has a chance. I love Cindy’s picking Mike she is giving pepper strategically.” @Queen18dion “So Cindy has been quietly eyeing Mike.. hmmm.” @Benny_0009 “Please what was Cindy thinking? She chose Mike of all people to share the HOH bedroom with her? He is married sis , Away with you! @Ewura_knaa “Cindy I’m not surprised she chose Mike. They like working with each other. I Stan.” @Mikebbnaija “Cindy is smart, she sees through all the bullsh*t and she is right.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
