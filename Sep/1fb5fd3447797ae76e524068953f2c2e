Barcelona have been fined just €300 by the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), for their actions in signing Antoine Griezmann from Atletico Madrid. Atletico claim that Barcelona reached an agreement to sign Griezmann, when his release clause stood at €200million (£178m/$221m). The France forward ended up completing a €120m (£107m/$134m) move to Camp Nou on July 12, with his buy-out clause reduced at the start of the same month. Barca have now been sanctioned by the RFEF on Thursday, for a breach of rules. “It is evident that the amount of economic sanction does not bear any proportion to the importance of the facts that have given rise to this file. “Taking into account the economic capacity of the club and the amount of the economic operation, this committee is aware that the payment of €300, beyond its merely symbolic nature (the fine is imposed because the issued club has been considered the author of a disciplinary infraction), will not contribute to the sanctioned club in particular and, probably, other clubs that may be in the same situation in the future, adapt their behaviour to what is required by regulation. “However, this is not a sufficient reason for this committee to opt for the imposition of a sanction – the closing of the stadium by a party – which, as stated, seems to be intended for infractions of another nature.” the RFEF said in an official statement.
