I’m tired of being the bigger person in this relationship. “Mercy wants me to go out of this house, she gives me trouble. Don’t try to finesse me and think you are in control. We are all adults in this house “I don’t know how to be in a relationship and she’s making it very difficult, if it was not in this house what you would see would be a different thing,” he said.
