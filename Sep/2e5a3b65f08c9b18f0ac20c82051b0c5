Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has provided the latest team news update on Antonio Rudiger, Christian Pulisic, Andreas Christensen, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Emerson Palmieri and Olivier Giroud ahead of the Blues’ Premier League clash against Brighton on Saturday at Stamford Bridge. Lampard’s men head to the game following a 2-1 defeat to Liverpool in their last Premier League encounter. “Toni has got a recurring injury in his groin area, not the original knee injury,” Lampard was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as telling reporters at Cobham on Friday. “We are trying to find a solution because he has still got some pain. We’re hopeful it won’t be long but I haven’t got an end date for you. It’s an injury that is ongoing.’ “Andreas should be okay. He trained with us today. He has missed most of the week. “He still has a tiny bit of pain but it’s hopefully not a risk. He will be in the squad. “It’s been a difficult week for Giroud because it was a strong illness that left him pretty weak. He’s been getting a bit of strength back this week and it’ll be touch and go to see if he is involved tomorrow. “Emerson now is going to be the other side of the international break with a hamstring injury. “Ruben we can’t give a date, but he’s outside jogging slowly. That’s a positive move for this week, it’s good to see him outside. We will see how that goes over the next weeks.” Lampard added: “I have four wingers to choose from now they are all fit. Pulisic we forget is 21 because of the price-tag. “It is normal to have an adaptation period. He has shown some good moments this season and in pre-season but he must do it daily. “He needs time to adapt but we support him on that. His time will come.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
