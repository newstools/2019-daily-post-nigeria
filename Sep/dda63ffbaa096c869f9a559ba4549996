A statement by his Spokesman, Femi Adesina said that President Buhari commended the Afenifere leader for consistently projecting the noble and progressive ideas of Chief Obafemi Awolowo. The statement added that, “President Buhari joins family, friends, professional and political associates of the pharmacist, who joined politics to serve the nation at a young age, and has demonstrated his love for the country by working for the welfare of the poor and underprivileged, and holding leaders to account on their promise of good governance. “As a legislator, who served in the House of Representatives and Senate, the President believes Pa Fasanmi’s focus on people has shaped his life philosophy and politics, noting that government can only remain relevant when it caters for the needs of the vulnerable and voiceless. “President Buhari extols Pa Fasanmi’s courage in standing for democratic governance and fighting for democratic ideals and values, praying that the Almighty God will grant him longer life, good health and strength to keep serving the nation.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
