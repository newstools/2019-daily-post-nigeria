I enroled them but he pulled them out, saying that I want to change their belief from his school of thoughts. “For nine months now they have not been to school. “The house we live in is dilapidated. It is infested by rats, He gives me only N300 to feed his seven children. “Sometimes I go out to do menial jobs to assist the family but he accuses me of prostitution. I can’t continue living with him. I want a divorce,” she said. The defendant, Sulaiman, denied the allegations made by his wife. ”When I left my wife was pregnant. When I came back, she told me that she had an abortion because she does not want to bear any child,” he said.
