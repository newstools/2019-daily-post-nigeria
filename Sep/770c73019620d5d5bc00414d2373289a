Real Madrid stars, Eden Hazard and Thibaut Courtois have backed Chelsea midfielder, N’Golo Kante to join the Los Blancos in the future. According to The Atheltic, Hazard and Courtois believe the 2018 World Cup winner is the type of player missing in Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane’s current squad. The newspaper reports that the duo have also confided in friends that Kante should be Zidane’s top priority target to sign. Hazard and Courtois were former teammates with Kante during their time at Stamford before they left Chelsea for Real Madrid. Kante, who is widely considered as one of the world’s best defensive midfielders, signed a new five-year contract with Chelsea last November. The 28-year-old is currently Chelsea’s highest-earning player on £290,000-a-week. The France international has missed Chelsea’s last two Premier League matches due to an ankle injury. The former Leicester City star is expected to feature for Frank Lampard’s men this weekend when they take on Wolves in the Premier League.
