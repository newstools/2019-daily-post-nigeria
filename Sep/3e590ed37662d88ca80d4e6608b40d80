Juventus have left striker Mario Mandzukic and midfielder Emre Can out of their squad for the Champions League. Mandzukic and Can have paid the price, for the club’s failure to trim their squad down this summer. New manager, Maurizio Sarri, has had to select a squad of 22 from a pool of 26 first-team players. Captain Giorgio Chiellini is also left out of the squad, though his absence was expected, after the 35-year-old was ruled out for six months after undergoing surgery on an anterior cruciate ligament injury. Summer signings Matthijs de Ligt, Danilo, Merih Demiral, Adrien Rabiot, Aaron Ramsey and Gianluigi Buffon are included, as is Gonzalo Higuain following his return to the side after loan spells at Milan and Chelsea last season. Juventus are in Group D alongside Atletico Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen and Lokomotiv Moscow. They begin their European campaign against Atletico at the Wanda Metropolitano on September 18. Juventus Champions League squad:
Wojciech Szczesny, Mattia De Sciglio, Matthijs de Ligt, Miralem Pjanic, Sami Khedira, Cristiano Ronaldo, Aaron Ramsey, Paulo Dybala, Douglas Costa, Alex Sandro, Danilo, Blaise Matuidi, Juan Cuadrado, Leonardo Bonucci, Gonzalo Higuain, Daniele Rugani, Merih Demiral, Adrien Rabiot, Rodrigo Bentancur, Carlo Pinsoglio, Federico Bernardeschi, Gianluigi Buffon.
