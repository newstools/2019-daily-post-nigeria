Details of Cristiano Ronaldo’s endorsement deal with Nike has been revealed. Football Leaks (via Der Spiegel) have published information regarding Ronaldo’s latest deal with the sportswear giant Nike in their latest book. The Portugal captain was reportedly the subject of a major battle between Nike and rivals Adidas, before he signed a 10-year extension with Nike in 2016. Ronaldo’s deal is worth a remarkable €162million (£146.8m), paying him an annual fee of €16.2million (£14.68m). Thanks to bonuses, he was paid €20.2m (£18.3m) in 2016 and 2017. Ronaldo is also said to have a €4m bonus clause in the deal, activated whenever he wins a global accolade such as the Ballon d’Or or FIFA Best Player.
