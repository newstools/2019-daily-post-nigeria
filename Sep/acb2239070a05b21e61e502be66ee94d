Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has explained why he took the decision to hand the captain’s armband to Axel Tuanzebe on Wednesday, not Paul Pogba. Tuanzebe was given the honour in Wednesday’s Carabao Cup third-round clash at home against Rochdale. The 21-year-old defender has admitted his surprise at being passed the armband, with the likes of World Cup winner Pogba in the same starting XI, but Solskjaer wanted to mix things up. Solskjaer told talkSPORT: “Axel is a captain in the making, he’s a leader – why not give to young kids? “We know we can give it to Sergio [Romero] and we can give it to Paul, that’s no problem and they’ve been captains before. “But it was Axel today and how does he handle it? He was absolutely fine, he enjoyed it. “It’s just a way of telling him that we trust him.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
