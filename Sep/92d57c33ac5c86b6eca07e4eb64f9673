Former Super Eagles captain, Joseph Yobo, has said Everton can win their first English Premier League title under manager Marco Silva. Having finished eighth last season under the Portuguese manager, the Toffees reinforced their squad with the addition of Jonas Lossl, Djibril Sidibe, Andre Gomes, Fabian Delph, Jean-Philippe Gbamin, Moise Kean and Alex Iwobi. With two wins, one draw and one defeat, Everton are in sixth position with seven points after four games. Asked if Everton can end their quest for the English top-flight under Silva, Yobo told Goal: “Why not? When I was at Everton, we qualified for the 2006 Champions League ahead of Liverpool. “Everton is a family club and also a cultural club – they have a way that they play and the fans are always behind them. “This season, they’ve got players coming in and when you sign a lot of new players under a new manager, it sometimes affects the team. The players coming in need to be integrated into the squad. “But obviously as from next season, I think they will have that solidity and togetherness and the team can perform better. “You can never say never, nothing is impossible in football. Now that the club is growing bigger and with the money they are spending, I’m sure they will attract more quality players and add to the ones they already have and that will aid their Premier League ambition. “So, the future looks very bright because for football clubs, finances say a lot and Everton have that spending power now.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
