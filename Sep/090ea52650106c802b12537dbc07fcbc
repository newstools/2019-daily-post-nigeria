Paul Pogba will refuse to sign a new deal with Manchester United, after seeing a move to Real Madrid fail to materialize this summer, the UK Mirror reports. The Frenchman pushed for a transfer to Spain this summer, even publicly expressing his desire to leave. But United blocked his attempts to force a move and put a stunning £180million asking price on him. Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer confirmed after his side’s draw 2-2 with Southampton on Saturday, that Pogba would be staying at Old Trafford this season. United would like Pogba to sign a new long-term deal, with two years left on his current contract. The Red Devils can activate a further 12 months on that deal, but were hopeful they could convince Pogba to put pen to paper on fresh terms once the transfer speculation subsided. But the player will resist attempts from United to negotiate a new contract, as he believes his future is with Real.
