Paul Ibe, media aide to Atiku Abubakar, 2019 Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, has hinted on likely winner of the Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, show. Ibe said BBNaija ‘Pepper Dem’ edition finalist, Mercy may emerge winner of the reality show. In a tweet, Ibe wrote: “After the penultimate @BBNaija eviction, it is looking probable we may be at the #MercyOfMercy for the ultimate winner. #BBNaija2019.” Recall that Biggie had evicted both Ike and Elozonam, leaving Mercy, Diane, Mike, Seyi, Frodd and Omashola as finalists. Similarly, Mercy had escaped disqualification after her quarrel with ex-BBNaija housemate Tacha. Big Brother had on Friday disqualified Tacha over act of provocation and violence. Tacha was sent out following her face-off with Mercy which saw both housemates hurl insults at each other.
