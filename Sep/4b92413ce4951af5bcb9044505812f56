Former Manchester United defender, Gary Neville, has claimed that the current Manchester City squad is “not good enough” to win the Champions League or Premier League and Pep Guardiola knows it. Guardiola has been left with depleted options in defence, after Vincent Kompany moved to Anderlecht while Aymeric Laporte and John Stones have been injured. It has forced the Spaniard to start defensive midfielder Fernandinho alongside Nicolas Otamendi at the back. Guardiola has also said that City could not afford reinforcements in January. “You have to think that City will spend in January,” Neville told Sky Sports. “I saw this morning that Guardiola said they didn’t have any money. Well, they’ve got more than everybody else. “They bought Aymeric Laporte in January a year and a half ago, and I feel that they’re going to have to do the same again. “This won’t be good enough for the Champions League or the Premier League. Guardiola will know it – he knows the standard more than anybody.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
