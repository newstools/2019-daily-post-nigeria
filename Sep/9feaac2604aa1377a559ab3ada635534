Also to prevent that South African stores in the state are not attacked, policemen took over the Akure Shopping Mall, which houses Shoprite and PEP stores. The shopping mall located on Oda road in the state capital had its main gate shut as workers with other stores within the mall were thoroughly screened through a narrow gate by security agents. Some of the staff were seen showing their identity cards to the policemen at the narrow entrance meant those on foot as they move in and out of the facility. The policemen, who mounted patrol vans around the mall, turned back customers who were stunned with the heavy security presence as well as the closure of the stores.
