Again, Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ Gospel Church, Adewale Giwa, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to release the founder of SaharaReporters, Omoyele Sowore and other political detainees. He said Buhari should not misuse power and remember how God saved him during his long medical absence in the United Kingdom. Justice Taiwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja had ruled that the previous order that permitted the Department of State Security (DSS) to detain Sowore for 45 days, had elapsed and ordered his release. In a statement on Sunday, Giwa said: “We make plans, but the Lord determines our steps, according to Proverbs 16:9. Nobody is greater than Almighty God who created us, and everything is temporary, nothing is permanent. ‘I don’t know whether Christians and Muslims are serving the same God, if we do, president Buhari should think about the God that saved him from illness in the UK and listen to the cries of Nigerians. “As a true Christian, the Lord’s prayer in which Jesus taught about forgiveness, is one of the most important prayers in Christianity. For we brought nothing into this world, and we will take nothing out of it. “Since 1999, Nigeria has produced three presidents before president Muhammadu Buhari, and none of them is currently there as a sitting president. Your time shall go, and another person shall come in. “Out of the three past presidents, Nigerians today can talk about who did well or not. The most important philosophical question to ask ourselves is that; what can somebody say after you?. Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap, according to Galathians 6:7-7,”.
