Liverpool legend, Jamie Carragher has named the Reds star, Fabinho as the best defensive midfielder in the Premier League. According to him, the 25-year-old is currently the best player in that position in the English top-flight league ahead of Manchester City’s Fernandinho. Carragher said this following Liverpool’s Premier League 3-0 victory over Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday. “I actually think Fabinho is the best in the Premier League now in that position,” Carragher told Sky Sports. “Fernandinho looks like he’s fading out of the City team and Rodri is just coming in but I think since Christmas when he came in [to the team] you could argue he was Liverpool’s best player last season. “Right now I think he’s the best in that position. I think Liverpool paid between £40-50m, it was a few quid, he had a difficult start but that’s where Liverpool have improved this season. “If you think of the start of last season how well they were playing but they didn’t have Fabinho.” Fabinho joined Liverpool in a £43.7 million deal from Monaco in the summer of 2018.
