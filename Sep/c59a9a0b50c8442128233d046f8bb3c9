Dr. Folashade Yemi–Esan, on Thursday, resumed as Ag. Head of Civil Service of the Federation. In her remarks after resumption, Yemi–Esan acknowledged Oyo-Ita’s hard work and dedication and promised to build on her achievements. In a statement signed by Director of Information, Olawunmi Ogunmosunle, the Ag. HCSF was quoted as saying, “there is no reinventing the wheel. I will only build on the sound foundation and structure which she has left behind because government is a continuum.” Yemi–Esan also appealed that the cooperation and support given to the outgoing HCSF be extended to her. Earlier in her handing over speech, Oyo-Ita said her almost four years as the HCSF had been interesting and eventful. She said the 153 paged handing-over note with annexures, is a clear indication of the depth of work in the Office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation.
