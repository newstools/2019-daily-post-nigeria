The Super Eagles threw away a two-goal lead in incredible fashion, to draw 2-2 with Ukraine in an international friendly on Tuesday in Dnipro. Nigeria took immediate control of the game, with an early goal. Joel Aribo finished off a fine team move in the third minute to make it 1-0. Gernot Rohr’s men went into the break 2-0 up, after Victor Osimhen fired in a penalty. However, they conceded two goals in as many minutes in the second half. First, Oleksandr Zinchenko dribbled his way through to pull one back, before Roman Yaremchuk bundled in the equalizer.
