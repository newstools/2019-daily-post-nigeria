A Federal High Court, sitting in Abuja, Wednesday, convicted Ojo Ayomide for internet fraud and sentenced him to three months imprisonment. Ayomide’s road to jail began when the operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, investigated his alleged involvement in internet fraud. The anti-graft spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren disclosed this in a statement, in Abuja. Uwujaren affirmed that the 22-year-old accounting undergraduate of the Ekiti State University, Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, was charged with one-count bordering on cybercrime. The charge reads: “That you, Ojo Olarewaju Ayomide, sometime in 2019 at Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State impersonates Scot, a Civil Engineer based in Miami, Florida, USA with intent to gain advantage for himself and thereby committed on offence contrary to section 22(2)(b)(ii)of the Cybercrimes Prohibition (Prevention) Act 2015 and punishable under section 22 (2)(b)(iv)of the same law.” He pleaded guilty to the charge when it was read to him. On this premise, Counsel for the EFCC, Maryam Hayatudeen reportedly informed the court of a plea bargain agreement with the defence, and urged the trial court to adopt same. Also, Defence counsel, Charles Abalaka, raised no objections, and pleaded with the court to temper justice with mercy. Abalaka said, “He will not repeat the offence and, will not go back to any crime”. In his ruling, the trial judge, Justice N.E. Maha gave him an option of fine of N200,000 and, ordered him to depose to an affidavit of undertaking to be of good behaviour. He also added that all items recovered from him, including a Samsung Galaxy S9 should be forfeited to the Federal Government.
