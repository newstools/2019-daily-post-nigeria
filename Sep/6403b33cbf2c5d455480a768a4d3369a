Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has admitted that he is not happy with his players, despite a 1-0 win at Sheffield United on Saturday, which kept their 100% start to the Premier League season alive. Dean Henderson allowed Gini Wijnaldum’s 70th minute effort to squirm through his legs and trickle into the net, to hand the Reds a 16th straight league win and a seventh this season. Klopp’s men were continually tested by the hosts, who came close to scoring through Oli McBurnie, Callum Robinson, Oliver Norwood and Leon Clarke. “For us it was important to win, we had unbelievably big chances, in the first half we had two big chances and in the second one which we scored from. “These games, they are not all beauties and you have to work hard for the results. “You have to respect the opponent, we had good moments and it was one of these games you have to win but not think too much about it. One team deserved to win, which was us, but all respect to Sheffield United, they were tough. “I was frustrated, and at half-time we spoke about it. We started well, but you have to do the same things again and again. “It’s about body language, it starts with the centre halves, it’s the little things. They threw everything at us, they worked incredibly hard, they were a real threat. “I am fine with the game, not overly happy but it happens. We were concentrated at set pieces for 95 minutes the boys were spot on. We didn’t play our best football but there we are,” Klopp told BT Sport after the match.
