Super Eagles winger, Samuel Chukwueze, has revealed that Juventus are his favorite club, apart from Villarreal who he currently plays for. It was speculated that Juve and Arsenal, had explored the possibility of signing Chukwueze this summer, before he agreed terms with the Yellow Submarine. Chukwueze has now told Goal that loves Juventus and idolizes Brazil international winger, Douglas Costa. “When I play FIFA on the PlayStation, if I don’t play as Villarreal, I play as Juve. “I know I am going in the right direction. I am happy just to be playing football and to see where that takes me. I always try to see the bigger picture, and to stay patient. “I am not one who wants everything immediately. I am happy to take smaller steps on the way to the bigger goals,” he said. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
