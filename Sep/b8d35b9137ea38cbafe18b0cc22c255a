Following the death of 36 cows which were struck by lightning at Ijare community in Ifedore Local Government Area of Ondo State, traditional rites are set to be performed at the scene of the incident. According to a member of Olujare-in-Council, the Agbaajo of Ijare, High Chief Idowu Awe, who disclosed this on Monday, under the Yoruba tradition, nobody could touch any human or animal killed by thunder. He noted that after three days of the incident, the ritual rites would commence. DAILY POST had reported how the cows were struck to death by lightning on the community’s sacred mountain known as Oke-Owa (Owa Mountain) when the herdsmen led the cows to the mountain top for grazing. Speaking on the issue, a 77-year-old woman, Mrs. Kosemani Akinro warned that more cows might still die mysteriously if they failed to vacate sacred places in the town. Meanwhile, the Chairman of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders in Ondo State Alhaji Kayode Ibrahim, described the incident as an act of God, praying Allah to grant the herdsmen faith to bear the loss.
