Big Brother on Saturday issued strike to Diane, Cindy and Elozonam for flouting Big Brother Naija rules. DAILY POST recalls that Diane had left the Veto power box at the arena games after Nigerian music legend, Tuface Idibia performed for the housemates. Biggie had on Monday given the housemates a red box to protect throughout the week. He warned that housemates will serve punishment if the red box is missing. But, Diane, Elozonam and Cindy who were in charge of the veto power box on Thursday left it behind at the arena. However, speaking to housemates on Saturday, Biggie issued a strike to Cindy, Elozonam and Diane. He said they were found guilty of breaking his rules. He also gave them punishment for the act, adding that all housemates will also be punished for negligence on Monday morning.   #Tacha must be very happy now aa #Biggie issues #Diane, #Elo and #Cindy strikes.  #bbnaija #bigbronaija #bbnaija2019 #BNxBBNaija4 #BBNaija4 #Bet9ja #Bet9jaBBN #BigBrotherNaija #BigBrother9ja #BellaNaija #Bet9jaBBNEviction #bbnaijapepperdem #Nigerian #nigeriawedding #nigerians #nigeria #Tacha #mike #jeff #sirdee #seyi #ike #mercy #frodd A post shared by  nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen) on Sep 21, 2019 at 7:32am PDT  Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
