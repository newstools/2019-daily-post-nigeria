The recent commotion that occurred at the Bauchi State governorship election petition tribunal in Bauchi State
has continued to elicit barrage of reactions from politicians in the state. The uproar was during its last sitting on August 2nd 2019 when governor Bala Mohammed went to open his defense in a suit filed by the former Governor Mohammed Abubakar. During the last court’s sitting, police personal had to hurled tear gas to disperse the rampaging youths suspected to be supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party and the All Progressives Congress to avoid violent clash. In a reaction through a press release signed by the Secretary General, Malam Nasiru Cigari, the APC youths Parliament condemned the negative development, alleging that the perpetrators were hired by the PDP and the governor. Cigari claimed that the incident had unleashed fear on the APC lawyers, calling on the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Mohammed Tanko to relocate the governorship election petition tribunal to Abuja for the safety of their lawyers and the panel of judges. “The unfortunate incident resulted in the serious emotional instability and instilled fear on our lawyers and teeming supporters of APC in the state. “Consequently, the Parliament urges the Chief Justice of Nigeria to as a matter of urgency, transfer the proceedings of Bauchi Governorship tribunal to Abuja for the safety of lives and properties that may easily be lost in the future,” he pleaded. However, the state publicity secretary of the PDP, Alhaji Yayanuwa Zainabari denied the claim that there was security threats in the state, opining that even if the state was not safe, it was the duty of the security agencies to recommend the relocation not APC.
