Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate, Diane, has given the real reason she nominated Omashola and Venita for possible eviction next week. BBNaija 2019 housemates, on Monday, nominated five housemates for possible eviction next week. Biggie, unlike previous weeks, changed the nomination process from being in groups to individual nomination process. Seyi, who won the veto power card, saved and replaced himself with Khafi. So, the housemates up for possible eviction are Frodd, Khafi, Omashola, Venita and Elozonam. Speaking on the nomination process, Diane in a diary session with Biggie said she nominated Venita and Omashola for eviction this week because they are strong competitors. “Venita and Omashola are strong and very competitive. “I nominated Venita because I feel like she is a threat. Right now it is all about the game and I’m ready for whatever comes and indifferent about nominations so I have no regrets,” Diane said.
