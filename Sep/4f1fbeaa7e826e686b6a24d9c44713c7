Liverpool defender, Virgil van Dijk, has revealed that Jurgen Klopp’s men must be ready to fight in every game in order to retain the UEFA Champions League title this season. He also warned his teammates that every team in the Champions League this term want to beat the Reds because they are the defending champions. Liverpool won the Europe top-flight competition last season after beating Premier League rival, Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 in the final in Madrid. “Overall in the Champions League anything can happen and obviously, everyone wants to beat us now that we are defending champions,” Van Dijk was quoted by Liverpool Echo as saying ahead of Liverpool’s Champions League opener against Napoli on Tuesday. “We have to be ready. We have to fight for every game and we are ready to do that. “Tuesday will be a tough game. Napoli are an outstanding team and they beat us in the pre-season game in Edinburgh and although pre-season doesn’t always say too much, we know how good a team they are.” He added: “I think the main thing is to put into your head that we all start from the bottom. “We may have won the Champions League last year but that doesn’t count for anything this year. “We are all starting from the bottom this year, that’s how it is because it is the reality. If we all keep that in our minds then we should be fine.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
