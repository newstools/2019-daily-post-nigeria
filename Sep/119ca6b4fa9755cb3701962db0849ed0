The National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has named 3-member Appeal Committees for the Party’s recently conducted Primaries for the Kogi and Bayelsa Governorship elections. This was contained in a statement on Thursday by Lanre Issa-Onilu, APC National Publicity Secretary. For the Kogi Indirect Primary Appeal Committee: Senator Abdulahi Umar Yandoma is Chairman, Hajia Amina Muhammed (Secretary) and Tony McFoy (Member). The Bayelsa Direct Primary Appeal Committee has Barrister Shuaibu Aruwa as Chairman), Edith Newman Amadi (Secretary) and Hon. Abdul Malik El-Yakub (member). It would be recalled that Governor Yahaya Bello won the Kogi ticket while David Lyon emerged the party’s flagbearer in Bayelsa. Meanwhile, former Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri, has rejected the outcome of the primary election in Bayelsa. Lokpobiri said that he and his team never participated in any primaries that declared David Lyon winner. He boasted that there was no way he would be defeated in any election in Bayelsa by Lyon, adding that the majority members of the APC were supporting him.
