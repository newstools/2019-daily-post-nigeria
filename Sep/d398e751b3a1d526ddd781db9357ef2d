The FCT Police Command has reacted to the trending video of an alleged bomb attack on the South African embassy in Abuja. A terse statement sent to DAILY POST on Saturday by DSP Anjuguri Manzah, Police Public Relations Officer, described it as fake news. “It is pertinent to state that there was no record of such an incident in any of the Federal Capital Territory. “The Command, therefore, wishes to reassure the public that it has put in place adequate security measures to protect lives and property across FCT, including Embassies,” he said. Earlier, the Nigerian government accused the “desperate opposition” of promoting news of the explosion. Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said the video was that of the bomb explosion at Emab Plaza, near Banex, in Abuja on June 25, 2014. The Minister said government opponents had decided to use fake disinformation as “handy tools in their avowed determination to make Nigeria ungovernable, having lost woefully at the polls”.
