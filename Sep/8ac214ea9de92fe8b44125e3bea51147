The Labour Party has withdrawn its election petition appeal against the victory of the Governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun, at the Supreme Court. DAILY POST learnt that the Labour Party and counsel to Abiodun have decided to settle for an alternative dispute resolution. It was gathered the decision came following a peace deal brokered by Abiodun’s lead counsel at the tribunal, Prof. Taiwo Osipitan, SAN. Earlier, DAILY POST reported that the Labour Party and its governorship candidate, Mrs Modupe Sanyaolu, in a Supreme Court suit number SC/1088/2019, had dragged Abiodun before the apex court, asking it to invalidate his (Abiodun’s) election. Our correspondent gathered that immediately the truce was brokered between the two parties, the Labour Party’s counsel filed a notice for withdrawal at the Supreme Court on Tuesday. A copy of the Notice of Withdrawal dated September 10 and made available to DAILY POST reads, “Take notice that the appelants herein intend and doth hereby wholly withdraw their appeal against all respondents in the above mentioned appeal filed on the 23rd day of August, 2019.” It was deposed to by Olusoji Oduntan Esq and N. A. Abass Esq, on behalf of the Labour Party. Contacted, the state Labour Party Chairman, Com. Abayomi Arabambi confirmed that both parties had agreed to settle out of court after a peaceful meeting was conveyed by the lead counsel to the first respondent. Arabambi, however, declined further comments, saying he would address the press later. He said “We have resolved to settle out of court. This was made possible by the lead counsel to the first respondent, Prof. Taiwo Osipitan, SAN on behalf of the Governor, Dapo Abiodun. I will address the press later.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
