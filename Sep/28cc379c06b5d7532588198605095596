No fewer than 10 persons have been reported dead in a road accident involving about three vehicles, including an articulated vehicle. The accident happened in Agulu, Anaocha Local Government Area of Anambra State. DAILY POST learnt that the accident occurred when the articulated vehicle that was carrying some heavy metals lost its brake while negotiating the road, ramming into one commuter bus and a private car, killing about 10 persons. Consequently, Chief Willie Obiano, governor of the state who was presiding over a state executive council meeting was forced to abandon the meeting to rush to the scene. A source said that the 10 persons died on the spot, while several others who sustained varying degrees of injuries were rushed to St Joseph Hospital, Adazi Nnukwu which is in the area for treatment. A government source told DAILY POST that Obiano, after inspecting the accident scene, proceeded to St Joseph Hospital, Adazi Nnukwu where the injured victims were already receiving medical attention. “Gov Obiano regretted the huge loss, and ordered the transfer of the victims to Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu Teaching Hospital in Awka for better medical care. He promised to take up all the medical bills of the affected persons. “Consequently, he directed that a barricade be erected on the road to avert such accident in future,” the source said. The Spokesperson of the Anambra State Police Command, SP Haruna Mohammed who confirmed the accident to our correspondent, however, did not give the number of lives lost in the accident but insisted that the command was still making a compilation of them before briefing journalists.
