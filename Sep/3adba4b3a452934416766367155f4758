Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate, Mercy, on Monday revealed why she handed over the immunity privilege to fellow housemate, Ike. The position of HoH is usually assumed by the winner of the weekly task as instructed by Biggie. In Monday’s task, housemates were assigned BBNaija’s Lastman standing challenge, where housemates were asked to throw small balls into any of the thirty cups filled with water with three attempts for each housemate in every round. Some housemates, after several rounds, fell behind in the course of the game, leaving Ike and Mercy to the final rounds of the challenge. Mercy and Ike, however, emerged winners of the challenge after Biggie gave them the options of them becoming housemate on the condition that one of them gives up immunity. Following Biggie’s instruction, Mercy agreed to give up immunity. Speaking after the challenge with Ike, Venita, Elo, and Seyi in the garden, Mercy disclosed that she gave the immunity to Ike as a gift. According to Mercy, Ike had always wanted the immunity, hence her decision to gift Ike. The BBNaija housemate said: “This is a gift I give to you, all through today Ike has been telling me I want immunity, he wanted it so badly, so I decided to give it to him.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
