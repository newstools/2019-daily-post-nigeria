Real Madrid president, Florentino Perez, is ready to appoint Jose Mourinho as Zinedine Zidane’s replacement, according to the UK Sun. Madrid have drawn two of their opening four LaLiga matches this season and were crushed 3-0 by Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League on Wednesday. Not only did Zidane’s men perform badly against PSG, they failed to record a shot on target. It is now understood that Perez is willing to give Mourinho a second stint at the Santiago Bernabeu, as he feels the Portuguese “is the only man to get the club back on an even keel”. Mourinho is open to returning to Madrid and felt he was a strong contender to get the job, after Santiago Solari was sacked in March. But several players in the dressing room, including captain Sergio Ramos, were against him coming back to the Bernabeu and Perez opted to re-appoint Zidane instead. Mourinho spent three years at Madrid during his first spell and won the LaLiga title in 2012.
