DSTV Nigeria on Thursday announced that there will be surprise evictions in the Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, house. The organisers confirmed the twist on their Instagram handle. The evictions will hold from Thursday (tonight) through Monday. This is expected to add more drama to the ongoing reality show as none of the housemates is aware. Winner of the ultimate veto power, Frodd had nominated five housemates for eviction this week. Frodd emerged winner after he picked four random pictures, one of which matched the exact duplicate inside the veto power box.  Biggie had said the housemate that picked the exact duplicate with the one inside the box would emerge winner.
