The Senior Pastor of Commonwealth of Zion, COZA, Biodun Fatoyinbo, has been accused of sexually assaulting a pregnant woman. Popular media personality, Adesuwa Onyenokwe, claimed that Fatoyinbo allegedly raped a pregnant woman. In an interview on Arise Television, Onyenokwe alleged that the victim could not speak up because she was married. According to Onyenokwe: “There’s not a lot of cases that we could have brought out with what we found. There’s a woman who was pregnant for her husband at the time that this same Pastor Fatoyinbo did rape her. That woman is still married to her husband. Can she ever come out to say that ‘Listen, this is what this man did to me? “The man knows, the woman knows. She can’t because most of the young girls he’s done this to are married. If I came to you and say ‘hey, I was raped.’ How many men are like Timi Dakolo? And they’re going about, publicly saying it.” Just few days ago, the COZA pastor’s ex-spiritual leader, Emmanuel Oset disclosed that he ended his relationship with Fatoyinbo due to allegations of adultery leveled against the COZA pastor by his former church member Ese Walters in 2013. Oset, who is the Senior Pastor of Canan Ministry in Ilorin, Kwara State made the disclosure while reacting to the rape allegation against Fatoyinbo by the wife of popular singer, Timi Dakolo, Busola Dakolo.
