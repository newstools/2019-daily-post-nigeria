Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, was left ‘irritated’ by Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid’s public pursuit of Paul Pogba, according to The Evening Standard. Pogba was widely expected to leave Old Trafford for the second time during the summer transfer window. The 26-year-old admitted he wanted a “new challenge” and made no secret of his desire to join Madrid to play under Zidane. The Spanish giants were keen to secure a deal with Manchester United, but did not have enough money left, after spending heavily on Eden Hazard, Luka Jovic, Ferland Mendy and Eder Militao. Solskjaer refused to criticise Pogba after he hinted at leaving Old Trafford, but was irritated by Zidane’s lack of discretion regarding a possible deal. It is also claimed that Pogba knew as far back as June that he would be staying at Manchester United.
