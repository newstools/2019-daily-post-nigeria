Former lawmaker representing Bayelsa East in the upper legislative chamber, Senator Ben-Bruce, has described the renewed xenophobic attacks on Nigerians in South Africa as ‘unfortunate’. DAILY POST reports that viral videos on Monday showed widespread attacks on Nigerians and their businesses in South Africa. The President of the Nigeria Union in South Africa (NUSA), Adetola Olubajo who confirmed the development to NAN said on Monday that the attacks began on Sunday morning in Jeppestown area of Johannesburg when a building was set ablaze by an angry mob. “The mob also looted several shops that were around the vicinity suspected to be owned by foreign nationals. But the Police later dispersed the mob and made some arrest. “Late in the evening of Sunday, Sept. 1, a group of violent locals suspected to be Zulu hostel dwellers besieged Jules Street in Malvern, Johannesburg looted and burned shops/businesses,’’ he said in a statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. The attacks and killings have since stirred reactions from well-meaning Nigerians calling on the government to take drastic measures against the South African government. But Ben Bruce, reacting to the development, said Nigerians in South Africa deserve better. On his Twitter page, he wrote: “I am saddened by the stories and videos coming out of South Africa. “I’ve also read reports that the Nigerian embassy in South Africa denied entry to Nigerians who visited to register their displeasure. These incidences are unfortunate. Our citizens deserve better! #Xenophobia.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
