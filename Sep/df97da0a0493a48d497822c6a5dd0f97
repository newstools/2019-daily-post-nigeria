Gov. Abubakar Bello of Niger State, on Wednesday said he holds no grudge against any individual or political party that filed petition against his re-election. Bello, who spoke to newsmen in Minna shortly after the election petitions tribunal upheld his re-election, also promised to run an inclusive government, NAN reports. Umar Nasko, the PDP candidate in the March governorship election in the state and his party, had dragged the APC candidate, Bello and his deputy Ahmed Ketso, before the tribunal. The petitioners alleged that the duo presented forged academic and declaration of age certificates to the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to contest the election. But the tribunal dismissed the petition for lack of merit and evidence. Bello in his reaction described the tribunal judgment as “a very fair judgment” and called on people to join hands with him to move the state forward. “Like I said after I was declared winner in March, that we should all come together because we are all Nigerlites as I am more concerned about the welfare of our people. “The judgment has been passed and I hope we can come together as one because I have no grudge against anyone as I am more concerned about the development of our state,” he said.
