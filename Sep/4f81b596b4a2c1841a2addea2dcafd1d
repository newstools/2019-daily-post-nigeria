Manchester United have moved to assure supporters, that the club remain committed to “competing for trophies at the highest level”. United, who lost 2-0 to West Ham on Sunday, won the last of their 20 league titles in 2013. In the subsequent six seasons, the Red Devils have been criticised for the way they have balanced commercial success, with building a team capable of challenging for top honours. But at a fans’ forum, United sought to address some of the supporter frustration, where they said the club is heading in the right direction. A United statement read: “Everyone at the club, from the owners down, is focused on competing for and winning trophies at the highest level. To do that we have invested heavily in the playing squad and will continue to do so. “At the same time, the exciting pool of talent coming through from our youth and academy sections is a result of increased investment in this area over the last five years. It’s important to note that while our successful commercial operation helps drive that investment, the priority is the focus on achieving success on the pitch. “Similarly, it is worth noting that we are not looking at or buying players based on their commercial appeal. We agree that recruitment is critical. We are committed to getting this right and there has been huge investment in this area to put our recruitment department into a position to be able to deliver the manager the players he wants. This process is significantly more effective than four or five years ago.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
