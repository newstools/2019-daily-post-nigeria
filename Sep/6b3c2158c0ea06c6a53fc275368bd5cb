Shehu Sani, a former lawmaker representing Kaduna Central district at the National Assembly, has reacted to the disqualification of Big Brother Naija housemate, Tacha and the eviction of Khafi. The former lawmaker believes that followers of the reality television show settled for Tacha when Khafi left by eviction. According to him, now that Tacha has been sent home, Mercy takes the centre stage. Big Brother on Friday disqualified Tacha for violent behaviour. This is coming after Tacha and Mercy engaged in a dirty argument, which had both housemates hurling insults at each other. Reacting to the whole scenario, Sani tweeted, “When our Khafi left, we settled for Tacha and now Tacha left, we are settling for Mercy hoping some of us will not be accused of mobile loyalty.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
