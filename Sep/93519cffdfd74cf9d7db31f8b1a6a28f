Fayose is being prosecuted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over N6.9billion fraud and money laundering charges. He was first arraigned on Oct. 22. 2018, before Justice Mojisola Olatotegun, alongside a company, Spotless Investment Ltd, on 11 counts bordering on fraud and money laundering offences. He had pleaded not guilty to the charges and was granted bail on Oct. 24, 2018, in the sum of N50 million with sureties in like sum. The defendant was subsequently re-arraigned before Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke, on July 2. He had also pleaded not guilty to the charges and was allowed to continue on the earlier bail granted. After his re-arraignment, Justice Aneke had granted leave for the defendant to travel abroad for medicals. The court had, however, ordered that his International passport be returned to the court, on or before Sept. 16. Aneke had then adjourned the case until Sept. 16, 17, 18, and 19 and also to Oct. 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 for continuation of trial.
