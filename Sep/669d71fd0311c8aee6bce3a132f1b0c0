The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has hailed the Federal Government for its stance against same sex marriage and transgender sexuality in the country. President of the association, Dr. Samson Ayokunle, on Tuesday in Abuja, described stance of the government on same sex marriage as a right step in the right direction. In a statement by his spokesman, Pastor Adebayo Oladeji, CAN lamented how such immoral practices were gaining popularity in the society, describing it as evil and abomination. The statement read in part: “At the creation, God created male and female, so, the so-called transgender is evil and ungodly “I commend the Director-General of the National Council for Arts and Culture, Otunba Olusegun Runsewe, for his campaign against lesbianism, homosexuality, transgender and other social vices. “Our Constitution and extant laws have no place for obnoxious practices such as same sex marriage or homosexuality, transgender, sodomy and related practices. They are an abomination before God and they are alien to our culture as a people. “Unfortunately it is being embraced by ‘some of our misguided brothers, sisters and friends.'” DAILY POST had reported that the Nigeria police raided a nude party organised by Bobrisky in Lekki area of Lagos State.
