Former Chelsea manager, Jose Mourinho has backed the club’s current coach, Frank Lampard to succeed at Stamford Bridge. He also advised Lampard to “grow up with the level of experiences” in a bid to kick-start his Blues managerial career. The Portuguse stated this ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash with Wolves on Saturday. “One thing is the player, another thing is the manager [Lampard],” Mourinho was quoted by Metro UK as saying. “The player, I don’t think any Chelsea fan will disagree with me if I say is one of the top five most important players of Chelsea history, and probably some will say not top five, maybe top three. “Another thing is his managerial career, one year of experience in Derby where he showed good qualities and now he has Chelsea in his hands. “‘He plays for big things. He plays Champions League, he played a European Super Cup, he had already big matches in his hands, and he has to grow up with the level of experiences, which I believe he can because he has huge experience. “I cannot separate from the fact that football has been always in his life. He was born son of a player, he grew up [nephew] of a football manager, he became a player, he became a top player… I think he has all the conditions to succeed,” he added.
