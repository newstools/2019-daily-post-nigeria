Former England international, Michael Owen, has identified Fabio Capello as the manager that ended his football career with the national team. He also said that Capello was one of the worst coaches The Three Lions have ever had. “He [Capello] finished my career with the national team. At the first meeting I noticed that he was very strict about food and did not speak a word of English,” Owen said in his new book, Reboot – My Life, My Time. “And we looked at each other and said ‘how will this guy explain something to us?’ In retrospect, the choice to give the bench to someone who didn’t speak English is absurd, I don’t know what they thought of the FA. “Not only did he finish his national career without an explanation, but he was also one of England’s worst coaches of all time. In my opinion it has caused enormous damage to my career and to English football in general. And they paid very well to do it.” Capello became the manager of England national team in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
