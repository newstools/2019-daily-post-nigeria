Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has said that Napoli can win the Champions League. Klopp watched on as the Serie A club beat his side 2-0 in their opening Group E fixture on Tuesday. Dries Mertens converted an 82nd-minute penalty after Jose Callejon was fouled by Andy Robertson before Fernando Llorente sealed the win in stoppage time. Klopp, whose side lost 2-0 to Napoli in last season’s group stage, was frustrated with the penalty decision afterwards and when asked about the Champions League chances of Carlo Ancelotti’s side, he said: “They can win the competition, that’s how it is. “If you have a good plan, if you have good players, which is what they obviously have, then they can win the competition. We experienced that you don’t have to be the best team in the world to win the Champions League. “You have to be in the right moment, you need to be lucky in some situations and when there’s only two guys in the room that think it’s a penalty you still have to accept that’s a penalty, but that’s all. They can win the competition, of course.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
