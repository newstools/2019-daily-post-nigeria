Musa Wada scored 748 votes, followed by Abubakar Idris with 710 votes, the former governor Captain Idris Wada came third, while Senator Dino Melaye came fourth. Musa Wada, from Dekina Local Government area of Kogi State is said to be former governor of the State, Captain Idris Wada’s younger brother and also in-law to another former governor, Idris Ibrahim. But reacting, Dino Melaye on his Twitter page said, “It is ridiculous to declare a final result of PDP Governorship primary election in Kogi State when my votes sorted out yesterday in 8 out of 10 ballot boxes are missing. “Only to declare votes in 2 out of 10 ballot boxes as my votes. Totally unacceptable. Senator Dino Melaye.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
