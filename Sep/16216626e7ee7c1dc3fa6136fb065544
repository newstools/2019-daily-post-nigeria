Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is worried Marcus Rashford could be sidelined “for a while”, after suffering a groin injury during the 2-0 defeat to West Ham. Rashford limped off in the second half, leaving United to play for the final 30 minutes with Jesse Lingard at centre-forward. Mason Greenwood missed the trip because of illness, while Rashford joins an injury list that already includes Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial and Luke Shaw. Solskjaer is hopeful of having Martial or Greenwood available for the Carabao Cup tie with Rochdale at Old Trafford on Wednesday and both back for Arsenal’s visit on Monday. “We will scan him [Rashford] tomorrow. “He felt his groin so probably be out for a little while. I can update you later when I know a little more. “It is just one of these moments. We’ve had, histrionically, loads of centre-backs of the last few years struggling with injuries. “At the moment it is strikers. Hopefully, Mason and Anthony will be back for Arsenal and hopefully one for Rochdale,” Solskjaer told reporters after the game at the London Stadium.
