Former Chelsea star, Cesc Fabregas, has urged 18-year-old youngster, Billy Gilmour to prove manager, Frank Lampard that he is good enough to make the Blues’ first-team starting XI. Fabregas said this while reacting to Gilmour’s display in Chelsea’s 7-1 win over Grimsby in the Carabao Cup fourth round clash on Wednesday night. Goals from Ross Barkley, Michy Batshuayi, Pedro, Kurt Zouma, Reece James and Callum Hudson-Odoi gave Lampard’s men all three points against the League 2 side at Stamford Bridge. “Billy Gilmour played amazing tonight,” Fabregas wrote on Twitter. “Personality is the most important at this age and he’s got it all right. “Now time to keep learning and taking advantage of these games to prove the coach he’s good enough.” However, Gilmour has since replied by saying, “thank you” to the ex-Blues number 4. Chelsea will take on Brighton in their next fixture in the Premier League on Saturday.
