Ukraine manager, Andriy Shevchenko, has praised the England-based Super Eagles players, ahead of Tuesday’s international friendly against Nigeria. Gernot Rohr has selected Everton’s Alex Iwobi, West Brom’s Semi Ajayi, Brighton’s Leon Balogun, Stoke City’s Oghenekaro Etebo and Leicester City’s Kelechi Iheanacho in a 22-man squad for the game. Speaking to reporters at Monday’s pre-match press conference, Shevchenko said: “The Nigeria team is physically strong, with good players, most of whom play in England. “So tomorrow’s match will be very interesting.” Leicester City’s Wilfred Ndidi would have increased the number of Nigeria players based in England but was excused from the game. Kenneth Omeruo and Henry Onyekuru, who were on the books of Chelsea and Everton respectively until this summer, are sorting out their work permits and asked to be left out too.
