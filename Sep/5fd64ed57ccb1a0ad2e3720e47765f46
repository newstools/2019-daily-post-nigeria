Cross River State Governor, Prof Ben Ayade has suspended his Special Adviser on Budget, Hon. Moses Onoh over alleged information leakage. Hon. Onoh’s suspension, according to DAILY POST findings, was not unconnected with information allegedly leaked out to the public. A statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Christian Ita made available to newsmen said the suspension took immediate effect. It explained that the suspension was a direct consequence of the Special Adviser’s mis-handling of privileged official communication. Governor Ayade warned all government appointees to desist from abuse of their offices, including the leaking of privileged official communication. “All appointees of government are hereby warned that His Excellency the Governor will not condone any abuse of office of any kind, including the leaking of privilege official communication,” he said.
