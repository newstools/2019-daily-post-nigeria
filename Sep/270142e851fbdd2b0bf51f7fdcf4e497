Real Madrid want Tottenham Hotspur playmaker, Christian Eriksen, to sign a pre-contract in January, as they prepare to move for Mauricio Pochettino too. Eriksen is into the final year of his contract and has rejected a new deal worth £200,000-a-week, as he waits for the LaLiga club to make their move. But Real Madrid are ready to wait until January to get Eriksen signed up, so they can get him for free next summer. The Spanish giants have also made Pochettino their No.1 target to replace Zinedine Zidane. The club were left shocked by the Champions League defeat to Paris Saint Germain and if they decide to fire Zidane, then they will move for Pochettino.
