Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, is furious with the club, for failing to seal a deal to bring back Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain this summer. Apart from Messi, it is understood that other players are at odds with the board, over the transfer debacle. Despite a number of meetings in Paris in the final week of the transfer window, Barca could not agree a deal with PSG. The Ligue 1 champions were not interested in a swap deal or taking a small down payment now and the majority in 2020 and 2021, as Barca struggled to present an acceptable offer. Messi, Luis Suarez and Gerard Pique all led the push for Neymar’s arrival and president Josep Bartomeu assured them he would do everything possible to get a deal done. Now, both Messi and Neymar believe Bartomeu’s push was mainly for show, an attempt to appease their desires. Then there are Dembele, Todibo, Arthur Melo, Nelson Semedo and Samuel Umtiti, who were all offered to PSG. As such, there is pressure on manager Ernesto Valverde, to get all players in the dressing room back on track.
