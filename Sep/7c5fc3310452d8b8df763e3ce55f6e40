Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar, is reportedly “incredulous” about the club’s decision to block his move back to Barcelona, according to Sport. Neymar, earlier in the summer, made no secret of his desire to return to the Nou Camp after two seasons in France. The two clubs held face-to-face talks last week, with Barca prepared to meet PSG’s asking price of £180m (€200m), by offering to send players in the opposite direction. But it has since emerged PSG were calling Barca’s bluff, with owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi telling club officials he would not let Neymar go for a fee under £272m (€300m). Al-Khelaifi knew Barca would not be able to get anywhere near that sum and Neymar is said to be feeling a “mixture of frustration and anger” with the club. The Brazilian will now remain in Paris until January at least, although Barcelona are confident they will be able to land him then, or next summer.
