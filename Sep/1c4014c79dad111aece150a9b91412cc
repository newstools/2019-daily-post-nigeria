The Yobe State and National Election Petitions Tribunal, on Wednesday, upheld the election of Ibrahim Bomoi of the All Progressives Congress, APC as Senator representing Yobe South Senatorial District. Senator Mohammed Hassan had challenged the victory of Bomoi and the APC in the 2019 election. A three-man panel of the tribunal sitting in Abuja held that the petitioners and his party, the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP) failed to prove their claims that Bomoi did not win with a majority of lawful votes. They also, according to the panel, failed to prove that the election was held without substantial compliance with the Electoral Act. Justice Susan Oji, who headed the Tribunal agreed with Bomoi’s lawyer, Akinlolu Kehinde (SAN) that the preponderance of testimony by the petitioners’ witnesses are laced with hearsay evidence, to which the tribunal could not attach any probative value. Justice Orji said, “In the final analysis, I hold that the petitioners failed to prove their case. The petition is hereby dismissed.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
