Arsenal forward, Nicolas Pepe, has explained why he joined the Gunners in the summer transfer window. The Ivory Coast international, who joined Unai Emery’s side from Lille for a club record £72million, said he decided to join the North London club over Bayern Munich because Arsenal is a club with a lot of ambition. The 24-year-old said this ahead of Arsenal’s Premier League clash against Manchester United on Monday night at Old Trafford. Pepe admits his decision caught some by surprise.

We want to win it. “The coach is used to this competition, he has already won it with Sevilla, and last year they were in the final. The aim is to do better and therefore win this competition.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
