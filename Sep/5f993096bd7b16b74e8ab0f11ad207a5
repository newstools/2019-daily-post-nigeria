Dani Ceballos told Real Madrid not to sell him, before he completed his move to Arsenal this summer, according to Marca. The 23-year-old joined Unai Emery’s side on a season-long loan and has impressed in his four appearances for the Gunners so far this season. Arsenal supporters are already hoping that their club will be able to sign Ceballos permanently at the end of the season. But the Gunners were not able to include a purchase option as part of their loan deal with Madrid, which means they must negotiate again with the Spanish club next summer. It is understood Ceballos urged Madrid not to sell him for two key reasons. Firstly, the midfielder is convinced he can be a success at Real Madrid and is aware the loan deal still gives him a chance of returning to fight for his place in the side. Ceballos was also against a permanent move, because of a dispute with his representatives and the midfielder did not want them to benefit from a significant fee, they would’ve received from a big-money transfer.
