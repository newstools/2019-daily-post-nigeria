Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has spoken separately to Jesse Lingard and Marcus Rashford, about concentrating on their football rather than their profiles, according to the UK Sun. Lingard and Rashford are two of the most popular players in the United squad, with the former launching his own fashion label last year. But Solskjaer and his assistant, Mike Phelan, have spoken to the England stars, about putting their football first. United’s 1-0 win over Leicester City on Saturday eased the pressure on Solskjaer, but the coach was concerned with Lingard’s commitments outside of football. The Norwegian warned Lingard to put work on his brand on the backburner, while he focuses on improving. Rashford was given the same warning, as Solskjaer feared he could be similarly distracted.
