Former Manchester United and Chelsea manager, Jose Mourinho has praised Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi for making him a better coach. The 56-year-old faced Messi’s Barcelona side 13 times during his time as Real Madrid coach between 2010 and 2013. Mourinho, who has been out of job, since he was sacked by Man United from Old Trafford last December, also came up against Messi-lead Barca while at the helm of Chelsea and Inter respectively. But the Portuguese now believes the experience of facing the Argentina captain was beneficial to him as a coach. “I always say that I owe so much to my players, as to those who have not been my players and have created problems for me,” Mourinho was quoted by FourFourTwo as saying. “For example, Messi never played on my team but I played against him and he has made me a better coach for having to prepare matches, for having to organize my team. “When I say Messi I also say all the great players I have played against.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
