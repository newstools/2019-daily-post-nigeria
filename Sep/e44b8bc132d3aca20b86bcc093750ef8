The House of Representatives has ordered Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) to pay all outstanding debts to hospitals within 90 days under the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). The green chamber reached the resolution following a motion moved by Valentine Ayika and 6 others on Failure of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) to function optimally. Moving the motion, Ayika explained that the scheme which consumes 1 per cent of the consolidated revenue has failed the Presidential mandate to achieve Universal Health Coverage by 2015. He revealed further that the scheme “currently boasts of a little over 6 million enrollees as at 2019 despite regular budgetary allocations.” The lawmaker from Anambra noted that the NHIS was being managed by ‘Overseeing Director’ appointed from the Office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation instead of Executive Secretary, which he said “has affected many critical and important operations of the Scheme.” On the lingering non payment of Healthcare providers by HMOs, he said “non-approval of the 2017/2018 Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) reaccreditation exercise report which has those HMOs not fit for operations but have continued to provide services despite their deficiencies.” The House, therefore, mandated the Committees on Health Institution and Healthcare Services to carry out holistic review of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) to encourage more participation by Nigerians with a view to attainment of Universal Health Coverage for Nigerians. Also urged the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) to ensure that private Medical Practitioners should, as a matter of urgency register their clinics with the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) as accredited health providers of medical services.
