The Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Awka, the Anambra State capital, has upheld the elections of Senator Uche Ekwunife of the Peoples Democratic Party for the Anambra Central Senatorial District respectively. Chief Victor Umeh of the All Progressives Grand Alliance had dragged Ekwunife of PDP to court, challenging her victory. Umeh had challenged the declaration of Ekwunife by the Independent National Electoral Commission, stating that she was not properly nominated by her party. But Umeh in his reaction asked his supporters to remain calm, saying he was confident of victory at the appeal court. He said, “Thank you very much for your Faith and indomitable Spirit! We shall prayerfully approach the Court Of Appeal after reviewing the Judgment! It was like this on 9th October, 2015. Today is another 9th! Let us not despair. God bless”.
