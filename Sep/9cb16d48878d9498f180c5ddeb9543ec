The Delta State Election Tribunal sitting in Asaba on Saturday, dismissed the petition challenging the election of Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, as the lawmaker representing Delta Central senatorial district. A three-man panel led by Justice Abdullahi Abubakar, struck out the suit filed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Evelyn Oboro, for lacking in merit. Oboro had approached the Tribunal, seeking Omo-Agege’s nullification, on the ground of alleged disqualification and non-compliance to the provisions of the 2010 Electoral Act as amended. But Justice Abubakar, while delivering judgment on the petition, maintained that the petition lacked in merit. The Tribunal was left with no option but to dismiss it in its entirety. Abubakar ruled that the petitioner could not adduce evidence to prove her allegations, adding that the petition was infected with the cancer of defectiveness.
