How can we have no dignity in our polity? “ Nigerians are being killed home and abroad and its all politics as usual. Shame. “The real enemy of Africa is laughing once again. We need a massive reduction, re-orientation and reorganisation of Africa. Some idiot and backward thinking South Africans have embarrassed the whole continent once again and the problem has shifted from that 2 celebrities. “Some of these celebrities are tired of shouting Africa unite all the time.
