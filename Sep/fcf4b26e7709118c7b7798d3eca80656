Seven gunmen who allegedly demanded N5 million to keep off a man but subsequently kidnapped him when the demand was not met, have landed in police net. The gunmen had written a letter to one Mrs Gloria Godwin, a resident of Gombi Local Government Area of Adamawa State, asking her to pay N5 million, failure of which they would kidnap the son, Godson Godwin. Mrs Godwin failed to pay and they consequently abducted her son. It was at this point, according to the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Sulaiman Ngurore, that Mrs Godwin reported to the police who subsequently swung into action. Ngurore, who spoke on the incident on Thursday, said, “Immediately she reported this to the police, the Gombi DPO mobilised his men who, using intelligence and in collaboration with some volunteer contacts, they moved against the kidnappers. “They were able to rescue the son and to arrest seven suspects now reasonably determined to have been the kidnappers.” The PPRO gave the names of the seven suspects as Abdullahi Musa, a resident of Karwa, Mubi and Bello Isah of Song LGA, as well as Atiku Abubakar, Yahaya Isa, Mallam Tukur, Kabiru Bawa, and Alhaji Jambi, while one Bello Alhaji escaped. He disclosed that “In the course of investigation, police recovered one locally made pistol, three counterfeit N1000 notes, two airtel sim cards, 14 cartridges of single-barrel guns, two bows and arrows, a copy of their treat letter, and two brand new motorcycles they used in abducting their victims.” He said efforts were still on to get to the other fleeing suspects.
