The Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, has reacted to the alleged gunshots during the governorship primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Lokoja, the state capital. Bello described the incident as sad and unfortunate. The PDP governorship primary election had ended abruptly in the early hours of Wednesday when unknown gunmen invaded the venue of the election, Lokoja Confluence Stadium and disrupted the process. Reacting to the development, Yahaya Bello directed security agents to get to the root of the matter. A statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Muhammed Onogwu said: “Bello who expressed his disappointment with the unholy development stated that such dastardly acts were an affront to the security of lives and property which are the primary achievement of his administration and the one thing Kogites have come to take for granted in recent times. “The governor remonstrated with the opposition PDP for failing to keep the law, especially as the rival All Progressives Congress (APC) which is the governor’s party had demonstrated less than a week ago that such events can hold without unwelcome incidents of any kind. “The Kogi State helmsman who said details of the shooting were still sketchy noted that the gunfire incident may not be unconnected with the usual do-or-die politics of some of the opposition aspirants whose desperation to win at all costs has led to so violence and crises in the state, including this one. “The governor directed the security agencies to get to the roots of the matter immediately, declaring that it portended grave danger to the state’s gubernatorial elections scheduled for November 16. He promised to update the public as soon as he has been fully briefed by the law enforcement agencies.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
