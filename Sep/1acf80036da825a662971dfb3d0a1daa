Chelsea have reportedly reached a verbal agreement with Real Madrid over a deal for midfielder, N’Golo Kante, according to Spanish newspaper, Defensa Central. The Blues have agreed to let the Spanish La Liga giants know if they decide to sell the 2018 France World Cup winner. Both clubs reached the agreement after the Los Blancos failed to sign Kante during last summer transfer window following the signing of forward, Eden Hazard from Chelsea. Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane has been a long-term admirer of Kante. Kante has missed Chelsea’s last two Premier League matches due to an ankle injury. The 28-year-old is expected to feature for Frank Lampard’s men this weekend when they take on Wolves in the Premier League.
