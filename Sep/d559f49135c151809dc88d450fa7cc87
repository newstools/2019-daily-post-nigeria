The United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Mr. Edward Kellon, has condemned the killing of an aid worker of Action Against Hunger, an international Non Governmental Organisation in Borno State. Kellon said he was extremely concerned about the increasingly dangerous and restrictive operating environment for implementing humanitarian assistance in crisis-affected areas, where humanitarian aid workers continue to face challenges as they strive to deliver urgent, life-saving assistance. Mr. Kellon in a statement made available to newsmen in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital on Wednesday, also said he was appalled and deeply saddened by the news of the horrific execution of the aid worker by terrorists. “My most heartfelt condolences go to his family, friends and colleagues. The United Nations calls on authorities to ensure the perpetrators are brought to justice. The United Nations also calls for the immediate release of all aid workers who are still in captivity. “I renew the call for all parties to the conflict to ensure the protection of aid workers and to respect international humanitarian law according to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, independence and impartiality. “The humanitarian community in Nigeria is working in line with the 2019-2021 Humanitarian Response Strategy, jointly agreed with the Government of Nigeria, to provide life-saving assistance to 6.2 million of the most vulnerable people in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states,” Kellon said. It could be recalled that one of the abducted staff of the Action Against Hunger, an international Non Governmental Organisation was killed on Wednesday by his abductors.
