Gonzalo Higuain says Cristiano Ronaldo has become mature since their time together at Real Madrid. Juventus striker Higuain and Ronaldo have reunited in Turin, after the duo won three titles with Madrid before the Argentine left for Napoli in 2013. Higuain eventually joined Juventus in 2016, while Ronaldo arrived in 2018, prompting his ex-Madrid teammate to move to Serie A rivals AC Milan on loan and then Chelsea last term. Both players are now together again under Maurizio Sarri. “We had already played together with Real. “Many years have passed, and I have found another player, a more mature person, with a family. “I enjoyed playing alongside him before and I am glad that we are back together,” Higuain told Fox Sports.
