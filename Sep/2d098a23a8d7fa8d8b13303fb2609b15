Pupils in Ogun State public secondary schools and technical colleges are to pay the sum of N3,700 per term, Gov Dapo Abiodun has said. This indicates a total of N11,100 for the 2019/2020 academic session. The Ogun State Ministry of Education, however, described the fee as a ‘donation’ requested by the Parents/Teachers Association (PTA). In a circular with reference number EDU. 655/5 and dated 27th August, issued by the Ministry of Education, it was learnt that the ‘donation’ had the approval of the state governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun. Gov. Abiodun, before and after his election was reported have promised to make education free in all public schools in Ogun State. On assumption of office, he declared a state of emergency in the education sector, promising to revive what he called the dwindling fortune of education in the state. But aside PTA levy, which is put at N600 on a termly basis, each parent will also pay N500 as computer levy on a termly basis, N500 as insurance, once per session, Sport/Jet/Literary will attract N300 on a termly basis. Also, parents or guardians will also pay N1,500 for school materials (caps, badge, beret etc.) and N300 for file jacket both for new intakes only. The circular signed by Director of Education (Secondary) Akonsolu M.I. on behalf of Permanent Secretary in the ministry also enjoined principals to “adhere strictly with the content of this circular as the state government has zero tolerance to collection of unapproved fees in all public secondary schools/technical colleges.” Meanwhile, residents of Ogun State have been criticising the Governor for reneging on his campaign promises less than 100 days in office. Some parents have also enjoined him to emulate his Oyo State counterpart, Seyi Makinde, who has aborted all forms of fees or levies in Oyo immediately he was inaugurated.
