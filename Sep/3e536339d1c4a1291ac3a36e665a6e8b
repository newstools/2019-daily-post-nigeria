The election petition tribunal, headed by Justice Adenike Coker, today upheld the election of the Speaker of Ogun State House Assembly, Hon. Olakunle Oluomo, as the lawmaker representing Ifo Constituency 1. Sitting in Abeokuta, the three-member tribunal held that the evidence submitted by the petitioner, Mr Wemimo Owolabi, of the Allied Peoples Movement (APM) was insufficient to nullify the election of Oluomo, candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Reacting, the Speaker appreciated the Judiciary for being the hope of the common man. He assured that the tribunal judgement would further spur him into more performance at the helms of the state legislature. Prince Oluomo emphasised, “that the people of Ifo-1 Constituency deserved good representation at the state Assembly, promising not to betray the trust and love reposed in him.” He, however, called on all aggrieved parties to put their grievances behind them and pitch their tents with him in a bid to ensure good representation and governance.
