Anthony Joshua has said facing Tyson Fury at Wembley Stadium in a “best of Britain” match-up would be his dream fight. Joshua first aims to regain his IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight titles from Andy Ruiz Jr, in a December 7 rematch in Saudi Arabia. But asked what his ideal fight would be, he told Sky Sports: “I always change it, but right now, I’d say Fury at Wembley. The best of Britain. It is a massive fight.” Fury is hoping to rematch WBC champion Wilder in February, having survived a nasty cut to stay unbeaten against Otto Wallin earlier this month. Wilder and Fury drew a fight last December. Asked if he would eventually fight Fury and Wilder, Joshua said: “Yes, 100 per cent. That’s like asking if a certain football team will play another football team. Of course. “We’re in the same division, in the same era. We have to fight each other. “We’re all big draws in the heavyweight division so it would be massive. “I’d love to fight Wilder, I’d love to fight Fury. I’m fighting Ruiz Jr next. The list goes on – there’s so many out there that I’d love to compete with.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
