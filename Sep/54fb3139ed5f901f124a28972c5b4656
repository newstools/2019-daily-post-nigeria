Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said the Europa League will provide a great opportunity for his players, to experience big games. United limped to a 1-0 win over Astana in their Europa League opener as Mason Greenwood opened his account for the first team. “We made it hard for ourselves. Games like these, you want to make sure you win the game in the first 20 minutes and you can enjoy it. “You could see some of our lads needed games but it’s pleasing we got the three points. We always know that in and around the box he is one of the best finishers we have got. “I’m sure [Mason Greenwood] will go home and be happy with that one. We think today was a great opportunity for them [the young players]. “We wouldn’t throw them in if they weren’t ready. Some of them won’t play against West Ham but will play against Rochdale midweek. “If you want to make it as a Man Utd player you need to handle the fans. Mason won the game for us. Angel [Gomes] did well and [Tahith] Chong showed glimpses. Two clean sheets so now we’re looking forward to Sunday. “The first four or fives weeks it’s just one game a week so you don’t really get to utilise everyone,” Solskjaer told the media after the game.
