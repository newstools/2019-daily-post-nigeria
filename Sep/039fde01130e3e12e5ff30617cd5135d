The Super Eagles arrived in Dnipro for their international friendly against Ukraine without their kits. This is because Turkish Airline, which flew the team from Istanbul to Dnipro, did not take the kits along, following a mix-up. Items also missing include bags of six players, who were on the flight to Dnipro. “Our kit bags did not arrive with us from Istanbul. “The bags of six players also did not arrive, but we have alerted Turkish Airline and they have promised to deliver them to us in Dnipro between Sunday and Monday,” the Team Administrator, Dayo Achor, was quoted as saying in the statement from the NFF media department.
