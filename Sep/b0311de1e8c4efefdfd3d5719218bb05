Former Manchester United captain, Gary Neville, has advised the club to sign six new players following their 2-0 defeat to West Ham United in the Premier League over the weekend. Goals from Andriy Yarmolenko and Aaron Creswell gave the host all three points against Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side at the London Stadium. But Neville now believes that Man United squad still needs to be strengthened by “five or six” new players in the January transfer window. “Ole will realise that that’s a really poor performance and that he has a lot of work to do,” Neville told Sky Sports. “I shouldn’t be surprised. This team is not ready. There will be lots of pain and it was painful today. “They were lethargic. When you let games drift and pass by, other teams gain confidence. “I’m not panicking but they need to really quickly and efficiently identify five or six players to go alongside De Gea, Maguire. “They need a couple of midfielders, a striker to carry the frontline, a wide player and a left-back. They know what they want and the fans know that. “But they have to be of the right type. It could take 18 months to find the players you want. I wanted United to win today but I’m not surprised. I’m not surprised West Ham did a job on them.” Man United will now take on Rochdale in the Carabao Cup third round fixture on Wednesday night.
