Ukraine head coach, Andriy Shevchenko, has admitted that the Super Eagles were a tougher opponent than Lithuania, after a 2-2 draw in an international friendly on Tuesday. Shevchenko’s men have never lost to an Africam team in the last seven years, but that run was almost ended, before Oleksandr Zinchenko and Roman Yaremchuk cancelled Nigeria’s goals in the closing minutes of the match. Gernot Rohr’s men had taken a two-goal lead in the first half and missed several chances to extend their lead. “It is very difficult to find the ideal at all. The team is moving in the right direction. It is impossible to compare today’s match with the previous one against Lithuania. “It is a completely different team made up of players who play in different championships. But today’s game was very important, we received a lot of valuable information,” Shevchenko told reporters after the game.
