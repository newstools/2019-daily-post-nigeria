Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has admitted that “words were said” between his players, after their 1-1 draw at Southampton. Daniel James’ opener look to have set the Red Devils on their way to victory, but Jannik Vestegarrd’s header earned a point for the Saints. Kevin Danso saw red for the hosts with 17 minutes remaining, but Ralph Hasenhuttl’s side hung on to deny United victory for the third game in a row. “The last three games, we deserved to win all three of them but that doesn’t give us any comfort on the table. “But it does give us comfort that we’re doing the right things, we’re on the right track. “With the players, we’ve got here now, and what’s happening on the training ground, preparation before the games, every single thing is spot on. So that’s it and we’ll get the results we deserve in the end. “[The players] can feel what they’re doing themselves, they can feel what they’re doing, they can feel [in] the last two games we’re a team that dominates games. Wolverhampton, we’re a team that dominates games. “The Chelsea one, the first one is classic attacking football against a very good Chelsea side but the last three, we need to learn to win games like this and the boys want to learn how to win these games. “I would have been really worried if we conceded chance after chance after chance. “Palace had two last week, scored two. Southampton had one, well there was one instance in 10 seconds where they created two chances, the corner and the next cross. Those were the two chances we conceded. “I would be very concerned if we kept on conceding chances and I can’t do much about the quality of the other teams because they’ve finished them off well,” Solskjaer said according to the UK Mirror.
