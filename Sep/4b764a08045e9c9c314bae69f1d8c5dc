Alexis Sanchez has said he hopes to play in the United States, once his time in Europe is over. The Chile international left Manchester United to join Inter Milan on loan this summer, after scoring just five goals in 45 appearances at Old Trafford. However, he said he still believes he has a lot to offer in Europe and would be keen to play in Major League Soccer at a later date. “I always have offers. “They had told me about Miami, but I have got six or five years left at a good level in Europe. “Although one day I could play in the United States. “I’d like it a lot to play in [MLS], it is a league that is growing and is very good,” Sanchez replied during a news conference, before Chile’s clash with Argentina in Los Angeles, when asked about a potential move to MLS.
