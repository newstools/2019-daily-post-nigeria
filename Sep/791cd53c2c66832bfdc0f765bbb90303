   Guinness Nigeria plc has launched a brand new stout – Guinness Smooth.  This latest addition to the Guinness family has a distinctly smooth and refreshing taste, with the perfect balance of flavours that are ideal for enjoyment while catching up with friends.  The new liquid has all the refreshment of a stout with the fine character of Guinness. Crafted with Nigerian consumers in mind, Guinness Smooth is a new expression of Guinness developed by Guinness master brewers, local and international, to deliver an exciting and stand out beer that is perfect for casual social occasions. Osemeke Oshiegbu, head brewer, GNplc says, “Guinness Smooth is brewed using only the finest natural ingredients, many of which are sourced locally. A perfect balance of roasted barley, special malts and hops, Guinness Smooth is smooth, refreshing and truly unique.”  Dublin based brewer, Peter Simpson, who has worked with the local team comments: “I love creating distinguished and exquisite beers. It has therefore been a pleasure to collaborate with the team here in Nigeria to create this beautiful beer. Bringing their vast expertise of local flavours and the Nigerian palate to my extensive experience in developing new beers, we have crafted a product that is ideal for consumers in Nigeria to appreciate as they catch up with friends.  Guinness Smooth is smooth, refreshing, and retains the wholesome Guinness character with which we are all familiar.”  Guinness Smooth, with its ABV of 5%, is best served fresh from the fridge at between 3°C and 7°C.
