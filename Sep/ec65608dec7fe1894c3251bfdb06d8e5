Arsenal striker, Folarin Balogun, will not be making his debut for England U-19 squad this month, after pulling out of the squad. The English Football Association confirmed that Balogun has withdrawn from the Young Lions squad due to injury. He has been replaced by Leeds United’s Ryan Edmondson. Balogun was among four Nigeria-eligible players named on the original roster by manager Paul Simpson. The others are West Ham loanee Ajibola Alese, Chelsea whizkid Faustino Anjorin and Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka. Balogun, 18, has played for England and United States at U-18 level and was part of the Young Lions team that reached the semi-finals of the 2018 U-17 Euros.
