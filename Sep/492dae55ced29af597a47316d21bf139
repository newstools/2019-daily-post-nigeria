Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has confirmed that defenders, Emerson Palmieri and Andreas Christensen will be out of action until next month. Emerson sustained a thigh injury in Chelsea’s 2-1 defeat to Liverpool on Sunday in the Premier League. The Italian left-back was joined on the treatment table by Christensen after the Danish centre-back suffered a knee problem against the UEFA Champions League winners. “Emerson now won’t be back until the other side of the international break (during mid-October),” Lampard told a news conference ahead of Wednesday’s Carabao Cup third round clash against Grimsby Town at Stamford Bridge. “It will be a few weeks because it is the reoccurrence of an injury so we have to be a bit careful with it. “Andreas is not too severe. Hopefully, he won’t be out for too long but I can’t give a timeframe.” This means Palmieri and Christensen will both miss Chelsea’s clash against Grimsby in the Carabao Cup and Brighton in the Premier League this weekend.
