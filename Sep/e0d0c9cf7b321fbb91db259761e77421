Chelsea midfielder, Ross Barkley on Monday blamed himself and his teammates for their Premier League 2-2 draw with Sheffield United over the weekend at Stamford Bridge. Barkley blamed Frank Lampard’s men for not performing well against the visitors. According to the England international, the Blues did not create enough chances and didn’t hit the target as much as they should have against Sheffield United. A first-half brace from Tammy Abraham, a second-half strike from Callum Robinson and an own-goal from Kurt Zouma ensured both teams got a point. “We didn’t perform well as a team so it was more speaking about the whole team as a collective and not individual performances. You’ve just got to try and make things happen but we didn’t create enough chances and didn’t hit the target as much as we should have. We all know and we all spoke in the changing room after the game that we didn’t perform at the levels we can,” Barkley told Chelsea’s official website. “We scored two goals in the first half which were gifted to us really, and he said if we’re not careful and we concede a goal then we’ll be up against it. We conceded a goal early in the second half and then things just didn’t go our way from then on. “Tammy scored two goals but he can’t win the game on his own. There’s a lot of talent in the changing room, the players we’ve got are unbelievable, but we just weren’t at the level we should be at. “It’s disappointing without a game coming up quickly to change the way we feel right now, but we’ve got to be ready when we come back to go again.” Barkley will now hope to lead Chelsea to victory when they take on Wolves in their next Premier League fixture.
