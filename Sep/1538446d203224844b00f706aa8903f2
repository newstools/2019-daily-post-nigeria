The duo, it was learnt were members of the payment committee of Sokoto Marshal Corps. Their arrest reportedly followed a petition jointly signed and presented to the commission by 39 members of the agency, alleging that their three months salaries were withheld without any reason. EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren said this in a statement in Abuja on Saturday. Uwujaren added, “They further alleged that the suspects refused to pay their salaries and had diverted the money for their personal use. “Preliminary investigation confirms the alleged diversion of the said sum by the suspects. They will be charged to court as soon as investigation is concluded”. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
