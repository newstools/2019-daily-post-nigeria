Fire on Sunday razed down a building and rendered no fewer than eight families homeless just as properties worth several millions of naira were also destroyed at Ovierugo Street, Okumagba Layout in Warri South Local Government Area of Delta State, DAILY POST can report. The cause of the fire is still sketchy at the time of filing this report. It was learnt that fire started barely an hour after the Benin Electricity Distribution Company, BEDC restored power to the area which has been in darkness for almost four days. Our Correspondent who was at the scene of the incident also reports that BEDC later withheld power. An occupant of the building simply identified as John said the situation would have been worse had BEDC not taken the light. John said he does not know where to go with his wife and four children. Another occupant of the building also identified as Mama Onome thanked God that BEDC took the light in the area during the heat of the fire. The single mother said her relatives were from where she lives with her four children, saying,”I don’t know what caused the fire. Nobody here knows. Where to sleep is now my problem. ” Other occupants of the building who thanked the BEDC for holding back power also called on relevant government agencies to come to their rescue.
