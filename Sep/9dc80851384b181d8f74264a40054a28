Former Manchester United midfielder, Paul Scholes, has said the team was let down by some of their senior players, during Saturday’s 1-1 draw at Southampton . The Red Devils took an early lead at St Mary’s through Daniel James’ third goal of the season, but defender Jannik Vestergaard equalized in the second half. The hosts were reduced to 10 men when Kevin Danso was sent off in the 73rd minute, but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side were unable to find a winner as they dropped points for the third game in a row. “I am disappointed. But it wasn’t the young players I was disappointed with, it was more the experienced players. “When Matic came on he constantly gave the ball away, Ashley Young gave the ball away, I don’t know how many times Paul Pogba lost possession. “These are the people that young players are looking up to, the examples you’re looking at,” Scholes told Premier League TV.
