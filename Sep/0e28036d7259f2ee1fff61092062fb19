Afropop singer, Yemi Alade, has said that she might never do a music project with Tiwa Savage, because of the “troubles” from their fans. In an interview with Ndani TV, Alade said a collaboration might not attract positive reactions from the public. “All my life when have been choosing collaborations, it is not based on how I feel. It’s unfortunate that with the feelings and troubles that people keep stirring in our ways, it probably will never allow us to ever have a collaboration. Because you’re not sure the outcome would even be positive or be over run by negative things and all the fights. “When we do music, we do it so people can be happy, so when we do a song together, what are we fueling? What are we encouraging? That’s the most important question when I do collaborations, there is an aim. I think what would be would be,” Alade said. In December 2018, the duo had engaged in a heated war of words on social media, after Alade claimed some female artistes enlarge their buttocks in photos to deceive fans.
