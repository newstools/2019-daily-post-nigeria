Inter Milan striker, Alex Sanchez has revealed that fellow teammate, Romelu Lukaku helped convince him to join Antonio Conte’s side during the summer transfer window. Sanchez who played alongside Lukaku during their time at Manchester United, joined Inter Milan on a season-long loan deal last month. The Chile international managed only five goals in 45 appearances at Man United since joining the Old Trafford club from Arsenal in 2018. “Romelu is a very good player. He is my friend and we talk every day. You can see that he is happy to be at Inter and he always want to win. He convinced me to come to Inter,” Sanchez told Sky Sports Italia. He added: “The team is very much united and this is important if you want to win. “The fans have not seen the team win anything for many years so there is great hunger to win.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
