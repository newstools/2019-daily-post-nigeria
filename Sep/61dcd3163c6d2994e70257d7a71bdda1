The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has raised the alarm over what it described as the influx of strange faces into the Southeast region. CAN also called for the immediate arrest of the President of Miyyeti Allah, for saying that there won’t be peace in the country if RUGA was not established in all the sates. The apex Christian organization made this known on Sunday in a statement jointly signed by its chairman in the Southeast, Bishop Dr. Goddy Okafor and the Secretary, Dr. S.C Nwokolo. The Christian body said that such strange faces should be made to leave the zone. CAN said “All the people without identity, who are flooding the zone should be stopped by immigration and other law enforcement agencies. “Also, suspected foreign herders and the killer herdsmen are asked to leave the zone immediately. Most of such foreign and killer herders have been identified in some parts of the zone.” It commended Governors in the region for steps taken so far towards addressing activities of killer herdsmen.. CAN, however, pointed out that “the local government chairmen, traditional rulers, President-Generals, (PGs) and councilors are living in the urban areas, thereby abandoning the villagers to their fate. “We condemn such habit and ask them to start operating from their villages. Let them come back and be the gatekeepers in their villages. “RUGA should be totally abolished. To this effect, we condemn the inciting statements made by the President of Miyyeti Allah, asking for RUGA in all the States, else there won’t be peace in the country. “CAN is calling for his arrest, as comments credited to him has always been inciting. Let him be tried by a competent court of law.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
