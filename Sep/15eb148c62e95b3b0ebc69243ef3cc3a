Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has called for patience as he continues the process of attempting to rebuild the team. United have taken just six points from their first eight Premier League games, while the club haven’t won the title since 2013. Solskjaer, who was initially appointed as caretaker boss before taking over on a permanent basis, says that he was never going to improve United’s fortunes overnight. “It’s not like the situation we had last year. There’s no lack of desire there. “For us it’s about building a new culture, building a new team, bringing everybody together. Is it the job I expected? Yes. I never said this was going to be a quick-fix job. It’s step after step after step. “Of course, we’ve hit a few bumps in the road, I never said this was going to be a quick-fix job. Rome wasn’t built in a day. “We need time, and the attitude of the boys has been great. [We must] keep working on improving the understanding and relationships between all players, and the style we want to play,” Solskjaer told Sky Sports.
