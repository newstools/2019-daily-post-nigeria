Manchester United legend, Roy Keane, has advised the club’s striker, Marcus Rashford to learn from Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling if he wants to improve on his performances for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side this season. Keane said this following England’s Euro 2020 qualifiers 4-0 victory over Bulgaria at Wembley Stadium on Saturday. “We spoke about Rashford, Rashford, sometimes the best example for any player is one of their team-mates,” Keane was quoted by Mirror UK as saying. “Rashford can learn so much from Sterling, whether training with him or watching him at close quarters. “That’s a great lesson and hopefully he is picking up them tips that we did see in the second half.” Rashford will hope to lead Man United to victory when they take on Leicester City in the Premier League on September 14 at Old Trafford.
