Member representing Degema/Bonny Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Hon. Farah Dagogo has warned against the implementation of Malam Nasir el-Rufai’s APC Committee report on true federalism. In a statement which he signed and made available to DAILY POST in Abuja on Wednesday, he described part of the report as injurious and antagonistic to the unity of Nigeria. He said the report was lopsided, particularly the aspect that deals with mineral resources, saying that it portends catastrophe for the nation if implemented. “Is ‘The APC-led Nasir el-Rufai’s Committee report on Federalism;True or Trick Federalism?, the lawmaker asked. Farah Dagogo, a PDP member further faulted the report, insisted that it was ferocious and capable of heating up the fragile peace which had been achieved in the Niger Delta region. “Take a look at the Fifth item of the Committee’s report under Mines and Minerals where it was recommended that; “mines and minerals, including oil fields, oil mining, geological and natural gas be moved to concurrent list. “However, all offshore oil shall remain absolutely vested in the government of the federation. I think it is time to take these bold steps and move away from over-centralization. “The question then is, why is the Committee trying vainly to wish away offshore oil which clearly belongs to the people of the Niger Delta? There are lots of contradictions in that.” DAILY POST recalls that governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress under the aegis of Progressives Governors Forum (PGF) set up
a Governance Steering Committee to evolve a governance template and revisit all policy initiatives and recommendations including those recommended by Governor Nasir El-Rufai-led Committee on True Federalism.
