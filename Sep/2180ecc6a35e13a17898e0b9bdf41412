Nigerian musician, Peter Okoye of the Psquare fame, has denied promising to give Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, ex-housemate, Tacha, the prize money if she’s evicted. Peter, who now goes by the stage name Mr P, had made the boast while reiterating his support for Tacha. On August 9, in a post on his Instagram, he stated: “If Tacha did not win, I’ll give her the money.” But after Big Brother disqualified Tacha on Friday night over act of provocation and violence, Peter said he never promised to dole out cash. In a live chat with Tunde Ednut, he said: “If anybody has the video, tweet from me or Instagram I posted, I will give the person N10mllion. I said I will help her make N60million, never said I will give her”. Tacha was sent out following her face-off with Mercy which saw both housemates hurl insults at each other.
