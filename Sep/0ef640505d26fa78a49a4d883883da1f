Arsenal defender, David Luiz, has reacted to the criticism on the club’s defenders following their Premier League 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. Christian Eriksen and Harry Kane scored for Spurs, before Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang levelled for the Gunners. DAILY POST had reported that former Manchester United star, Gary Neville had slammed Arsenal centre-back Sokratis Papastathopoulos for his “terrible” defending, in the build-up to Tottenham’s opening goal in Sunday’s North London derby. But Luis has now said that Arsenal’s defenders must learn how to accept any criticism that comes their way. “I think the criticism is normal, in my all my career it has been like that, especially when you are a defender,” Luiz was quoted by Metro UK as saying on Monday. “Strikers never lose games unless if they miss a penalty in the last minute, this is football. “The defenders have to take responsibility and take [criticism] in a good way, in a humble way. “We need to understand when we make a mistake and say that.” Luiz will now hope to lead Arsenal to victory when they take on Watford in their next Premier League fixture after the international break.
