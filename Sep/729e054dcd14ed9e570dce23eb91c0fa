Former Super Eagles striker, Kanu Nwankwo, has tipped Thierry Henry, to bounce back from his disastrous spell as Monaco boss and manage Arsenal. Henry took up his first management role in November 2018, replacing Leonardo Jardim at Monaco. He was eventually sacked after winning just five of his 20 games in all competitions. Kanu, who played with Henry at Arsenal between 1999 and 2004, told Goal: “He’s a warrior. Somebody who doesn’t give up. “I think he did it [at Monaco] but it didn’t work. But it’s always good to go and get the experience and see how it works. “If it goes good or it goes bad, that doesn’t change who you are. You have to keep going and I know he is not someone who takes defeat. “He wants to win, so he will bounce back and coach again at a good club.” On the possibility of landing the Arsenal job, Kanu added: “I believe that is what he is aiming at. “It’s the club where he is a legend, the club that loves him. So why not? That’s where he is supposed to be.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
