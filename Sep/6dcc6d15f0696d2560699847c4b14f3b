The Senator representing Benue South Senatorial District, Comrade Abba Moro, on Monday urged Nigerians to work and pray for a united country. This was as he called on Nigerians to have faith, remain steadfast and pray for one and united Nigeria. He tasked every citizen to believe in the project “Nigeria’’ and pray for peace and progress of the country despite the myriad of problems confronting the nation. Moro made the call in his goodwill message to mark Nigeria’s 59th independence anniversary and was signed by his Media Aide, Ameh Ameh. The lawmaker also enjoined Nigerians to eschew what he described as “mundane issues such as ethnicity or religious differences that tend to cause disharmony among citizens.” He admitted that “No doubt, our journey as a nation since gaining independence in 1960 has been eventful, to say the least. “The fact that we have come this far as one united country despite the enormous challenges we face as a nation gives us every reason to celebrate. “We have our challenges as a nation of diverse cultures and ethnicities, but we should not give up on the project Nigeria. “The task for a greater Nigeria is a collective responsibility and as such, we must pray and work towards peace and progress of the nation. “Let us remain focused, steadfast and committed to the task of building a progressive and united Nigeria.” Senator Moro further urged the federal government to initiate and implement ideas and strategies that would further improve the standard of living of the citizenry.
