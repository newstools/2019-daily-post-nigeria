President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday met with members of the Police Service Commission at the State House, Abuja. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the agenda of the meeting between the president and members of the commission would include the presentation of the 2018 Annual Report of the Police Commission. The president might have also used the opportunity to wade into the reported misunderstanding between the Office of the Inspector-General of Police and the Police Service Commission over the recruitment of 10,000 personnel. President Buhari had in 2016 approved the recruitment of 10,000 policemen as part of fresh measures to address the nation’s security challenges including banditry, kidnapping and the farmers/herdsmen clashes across the country. DAILY POST recalls that the PSC had advised applicants to disregard a list in circulation.  A statement by its spokesman, Ikechukwu Ani, said the list was compiled solely by the Nigeria Police Force without the involvement of the Police Service Commission. “All candidates who took part in the aptitude test held on Saturday, August 3rd, 2019 are hereby to watch out for the authentic list that will emerge after the meeting of the bodies. “The leadership of the commission since coming into office has been doing everything possible to restore sanity not only in the recruitment exercise but also in all other facets of the mandate of the commission”. He said the commission will never compromise or abdicate its constitutional mandate and will continue to insist that the recruitment exercise is merit-driven, transparent and in conformity with the Public Service Rules and Federal Character principle. “PSC will resist any attempt to sabotage its efforts in this direction. Applicants are therefore advised not to panic or despair as all their interests will be adequately protected”, it added.
