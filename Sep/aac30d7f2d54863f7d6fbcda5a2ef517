A 12-year-old primary school pupil has allegedly been raped by her teacher. DAILY POST gathered Wednesday that the teacher, Nathan Yusuf, committed the crime on Tuesday in Namtari, a community in Yola South Local Government Area of Adamawa State. A witness said residents of Namtari who rounded up the suspect, handed him over to the men of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), who whisked him away to their headquarters in the state capital, Yola. Another source said the young victim was taken to the Sexual Assault Referral Centre, otherwise called Adamawa Hope Centre, at the state Specialist Hospital in Yola, for trauma and psycho-social management. A relation of the girl, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said of the incident: “This is a girl we are all proud of. We have been guiding and encouraging her to acquire both western and Qur’anic knowledge. Now, a teacher for that matter has defiled her as a minor. Where is the security in entrusting our children to teachers?” The Public Relations Officer of the NSCDC in Adamawa State, Sulaiman Baba, confirmed the arrest of the suspect, and assured that he would be taken to court for trial after due investigation.
