The Governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, on Tuesday, warned the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) against unauthorised use of his name as Chairman of the party’s Governors Forum to issue statements. The warning was contained in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Fidelis Soriwei, in Yenegua, the state capital. He condemned in strong terms the conduct of using his name without seeking his clarifications and consent to make comments on national issues. The governor pointed out that while he was reputed for making comments on sensitive national issues, it was odd and criminal for any person or group of persons to make attributions to him in statements he did not authorize. Dickson warned persons behind the deplorable act to desist forthwith, stressing that it was the conventional standard for him to be consulted on all statements to avoid misrepresentation. He, therefore, directed that every statement from the forum must be personally authorized by him. He said, “It has come to my attention that some members of the People’s Democratic Party are using my name to issue statements without seeking my consent and approval especially on issues involving the PDP Governors Forum. “Everyone knows that I am capable of taking positions on national issues. Cowards should not hide under my name and that of the forum to make statements. I have always made statements on issues that I am passionate about without any fear. “I condemn in very strong terms any tendency to willfully use my name to issue a statement without my consent. It is reprehensible, condemnable and must stop forthwith. “Henceforth all statements emanating from the PDP Governors Forum must be authorized personally by me.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
