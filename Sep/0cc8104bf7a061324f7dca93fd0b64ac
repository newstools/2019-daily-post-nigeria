The police in Ogun State have arrested a 40-year-old okada rider, Kingsley Madukwe, for allegedly beating his 40-year-old wife, Glory Madukwe to death. The arrest of the suspect, it was learnt, was a result of a report by one Chief Rafiu Gbadamosi, the Baale of Egando in Atan, Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government area of the state. The Baale had told the police that the couple had a minor misunderstanding as a result of which the husband beat the wife to death at about 11:30pm on Wednesday. A statement by the State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, said the DPO Atan Ota division, SP Salau Abiodun, led his detectives to the scene where the suspect was promptly arrested. “On interrogation, the suspect, who is an indigene of Ihiala in Anambra State, narrated that his late wife, a mother of eight, was having a month old baby and that the baby was crying, which made him to wake his wife up to breastfeed the baby, but she refused claiming that she was too tired to breastfeed the baby at that time,” Oyeyemi said. The PPRO added that the deceased wife got up and went to the sitting room without carrying the baby. This was said to have angered the husband, consequent upon which he drew his wife back and “gave her a hot slap.” He said the woman fell down and gave up the ghost. The corpse of the victim had since been deposited at the General Hospital, Ota mortuary for post mortem. “The Commissioner of Police, CP Bashir Makama, has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspect to the Homicide Section of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for further investigation and prosecution,” Oyeyemi said.
