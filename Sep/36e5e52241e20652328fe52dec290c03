Paul Enenche, the Senior Pastor of Dunamis International Gospel Centre, has reacted to the xenophobic attacks on Nigerians and other foreigners in South Africa. He spoke during Wednesday’s evening service at the church’s headquarters, Glory Dome in Abuja. According to the Dunamis pastor: “I speak to those in South Africa right now, it doesn’t matter What is happening, you are preserved. “I prophesy to all troubled areas in the world including South Africa, you are preserved because you carry to life of God. “You are destined to pass through danger unhurt because that is the very life of God. “The spirit that raise Jesus Christ from dead revitalises and re-energizes the human body.” A video had surfaced online of South Africans attacking some Nigerians and foreigners in their country. Confirming the incident, the President of the Nigeria Union South Africa (NUSA), Adetola Olubajo said the attacks began on Sunday morning in Jeppestown area of Johannesburg when a building was set ablaze by an angry mob. “The mob also looted several shops that were around the vicinity suspected to be owned by foreign nationals. But the Police later dispersed the mob and made some arrest. “Late in the evening of Sunday, Sept. 1, a group of violent locals suspected to be Zulu hostel dwellers besieged Jules Street in Malvern, Johannesburg looted and burned shops/businesses,’’ he said in a statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. Against the backdrop of the xenophobic attack in South Africa, some aggrieved Nigerians had embarked on reprisal attacks on businesses owned by South Africans in the country. The aggrieved youths attack some outlets of Shoprite and MTN offices in some states.
