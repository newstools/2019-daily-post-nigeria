Germany on Friday confirmed its first case of the mosquito-spread West Nile virus in a human. Dpa reports that the German from the eastern state of Saxony, who suffered from encephalitis, was treated at the Klinikum St. Georg in Leipzig and had since recovered. Meanwhile, several institutions, including the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, had also announced the virus. The virus, which originally stems from Africa, first occurred in Germany in animals in 2018. It is transmitted by certain breeds of mosquitoes. Owls, birds of prey and ravens are the virus’ most common hosts. However, it can also be transmitted to horses and humans.
