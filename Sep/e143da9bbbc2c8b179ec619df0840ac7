Former Political Adviser to ex-Governor, Adams Oshiomhole, Mr. Charles Idahosa has said the rift between the APC Chairman and Godwin Obaseki will be difficult to settle. Speaking in a chat with newsmen in Benin City, Idahosa said the rift between Oshiomhole and Obaseki would be difficult to settle because it emanated from envy and jealousy. Idahosa, however, noted that Governor Godwin Obaseki would win re-election in 2020 even without the support of Oshiomhole. According to him, Oshiomhole is intimidated by Obaseki’s achievements, adding that Obaseki had performed 85 per cent in three years against Oshiomhole’s 45 per cent performance in eight years. Idahosa said, “Oshiomhole said he brought only one Commissioner. That is a lie. Oshiomhole brought the Deputy Governor, he brought the APC State Chairman, he brought the SSG. “The main issue between Oshiomhole and Obaseki has not been brought to the fore. We know they are busy working underground to stop Obaseki but nobody can stop Obaseki from having his eight years. “Obaseki’s record is so intimidating. Oshiomhole wants to be the lone star in the state. The truth is that Oshiomhole is envious and jealous of Obaseki. “Governor Obaseki has won the hearts of the people through infrastructural projects that cut across the state and bringing sanity to governance.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
