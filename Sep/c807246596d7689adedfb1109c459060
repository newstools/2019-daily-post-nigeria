Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has ‘congratulated’ rivals Liverpool on winning the Premier League, after his side lost 3-2 at Norwich on Saturday. The City boss joked that Jurgen Klopp’s side have won the league, after the Reds beat Newcastle 3-1, to go five points clear at the top. Speaking to reporters after the shock defeat to the newly-promoted Canaries, Guardiola said: “We’re in September… we’re going to do that? Okay: congratulations, Liverpool, you are the champions. “We’re in September! We’ll recover, go to Ukraine, then we come back. “Of course, we’ve dropped five points. Tottenham was a pity because we played very well. “Against Norwich, it was in the important parts, in set pieces for example, that the players have to know exactly what to do.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
