Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in the last election, has reacted to the death of PDP Stewart, Mrs Toyin Ajinde. Ajinde, a chieftain of the PDP in Ondo State was involved in an auto crash few weeks ago. She, however, gave up the ghost at the Trauma Centre in Ondo on Friday, after being in coma since the accident, which occurred on September 6. Recall that DAILY POST had reported that the deceased alongside the Senator representing Ondo South at the National Assembly, Nicholas Tofowomo were involved in ghastly accident, which occurred at Igara-Oke axis of the Ilesa-Owo highway while on their way to Akure from an official engagement in Ibadan. Reacting to the sad news in a tweet on Sunday evening, Atiku said, Toyin Ajinde’s commitment to a better Nigeria was unparalleled. “As a PDP woman leader in Ondo, she worked tirelessly to achieve this. I knew this because she was my longtime staunch supporter. “I’m saddened by her loss. May her family be comforted & her soul rest in peace.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
