The Movement for the Actualisation of Sovereign State of Biafra, MASSOB, has said it will soon actualise the dream of an independent Biafra State without war or bloodshed The group gave the hint on Friday at a seminar to sensitize members of the public in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital, on its non violent campaign agitation for a Biafra state. Speaking, MASSOB Coordinator in Uyo, Mr. Nsikak Akpan, urged members to be focused and law abiding, noting that the seminar marked a departure from the annual processions and rallies around cities and towns in Cross River and Akwa Ibom States. He said, “In his room in Imo State, Chief Uwazurike began this vision to actualise a Biafra state without firing a gun and the campaign has continued to gain momentum and we are confident that very soon we shall have a Biafra state without fighting a war with anyone.” He said though many years have gone by since the agitation started, it is within view from events in Nigeria that things are falling apart and individuals units seeking to have their freedom will achieve their desire soon. Similarly, another leader, Francis Johnson said killing and destruction of property as was the case during the civil war do not bring about the actualisation of a dream that is the reason for the violence free campaign by MASSOB. “You cannot kill and destroy the people and land you want to develop so we decided on a non confrontational agitation for the actualisation of a Biafra nation where equality will be the watchword,” he said.
