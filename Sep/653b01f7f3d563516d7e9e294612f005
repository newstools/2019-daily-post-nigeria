Barcelona manager, Ernesto Valverde, has said Lionel Messi’s comments about his future at the club, have been overplayed. This week, it was revealed that Messi has a clause, that enables him to leave for free at the end of each season. However, Valverde is adamant Messi’s words have been misinterpreted, although Barca’s head coach acknowledged he is unable to control what players say in the press. “I didn’t want to read it. I know what Leo has to say. “He expresses himself naturally and then people tend to misinterpret what he has said. “Everything he says, people try to squeeze out every sub-meaning from his words. I think he was just trying to express things naturally, I don’t think we need to worry. “I don’t think there are any doubts regarding his future. It’s the club that decides which players it’s going to keep or not, but I don’t think there are any concerns, certainly I don’t have any concerns about it,” Valverde told a press conference on Friday.
