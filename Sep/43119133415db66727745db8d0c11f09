Paul Ibe, media aide of the presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the last election, Atiku Abubakar, has asked Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, to tell Nigerians the kind of marijuana he smokes. He said this in reaction to Mohammed’s statement that Atiku should apologize to Nigerians for “willfully distracting” the President Muhammadu Buhari administration with an election petition. The Minister said while the PDP and its candidate reserved the right to pursue their petition to the highest level, they will be better served by dropping their toga of desperation and realizing that there is a limit to tomfoolery. “Nigerians are tired of this orchestrated distraction, and will rather wish that the opposition, having lost at the polls and in court, will now join hands with the government to move Nigeria to the next level. “This is more so that the judgement validating the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari was unanimous that the petition lacked merit, that the petitioners failed to prove any of the grounds upon which their case was anchored and that President Buhari is eminently qualified to contest the poll. “It is intriguing that a party that trumpets the rule of law at every turn will present, in open court, evidence it claimed to have obtained by hacking into a supposed INEC server,” he had said. On Twitter, Ibe tweeted: “Lai: Atiku should apologise to Nigerians. “Me: For real? What type of weed are you smoking? It can only be #CertifiedWeed.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
