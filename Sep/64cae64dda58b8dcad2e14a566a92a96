Jose Mourinho has written off Manchester United’s title hopes this season and says his former club faces a fight to finish in the top four of the Premier League. United have endured an indifferent start to the 2019/2020 campaign, thumping Chelsea on the opening day, before dropping points to Wolves, Crystal Palace and Southampton. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side returned to winning ways last weekend with a 1-0 victory against Leicester City and face West Ham at the London Stadium on Sunday afternoon. Ahead of the game, Mourinho was asked where he expects Manchester United to finish in the Premier League and told Sky Sports: “They will finish between fourth and sixth. “That’s my point of view. They are not capable of fighting for the top-two. It will be a good achievement if they finish in the top four this season and get back into the Champions League. “The objective should be to finish in the top four and build from there. “They’re not thinking about fighting for the title and that’s a perfect environment to bring in some younger players and build for the future.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
