Sunday Onukwubiri, the Secretary of the Abia state chapter of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), has tackled the 2019 governorship candidate of the party, Alex Otti over alleged desperation to hijack the structures of the party in the state. Onukwubiri spoke in a statement obtained by DAILY POST on Monday, insisting that the suspension slammed on Otti by the Abia leadership of APGA stands. He said, “Dr. Alex Otti has been suspended from the party, and has no dealing with any chieftain of APGA. Attaching APGA to Alex is a misplaced norm because he was suspended on the 15th day of July, 2019. Only the National leadership of the party under Ozonkpu Victor Ike Oye can absolve him of that action of the state leadership. “The party filed application to withdraw herself from Alex Otti’s petition and the tribunal refused us the application on the ground of filing late, we are not relenting on our disassociation from the processes, the courts are there for anybody to approach and get justice, it is only a client that has the right to withdraw from whatever matter he is involved, much more, a petition the party was not consulted and has no hands in it. “Anything outside the Ehiemere led leadership of APGA in Abia State remains a big joke and can never thrive in the clothes of the party”. The Abia state chapter of the APGA has for long been enmeshed in irreconcilable squabble over who to control the structures of the party. The Augustine Ehiemere-led faction of APGA in Abia, during the hearing of the petition filed by Dr. Otti, had approached the tribunal seeking withdrawal of its petition filed in the matter between Dr. Alex Otti and Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu, the Standard bearer of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the last election. The tribunal rejected the APGA application seeking to pull out from the case. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
