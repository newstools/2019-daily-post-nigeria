Rangers manager, Steven Gerrard, has hailed Joel Aribo, after he made his Nigeria debut. The midfielder made a goalscoring debut for the three-time African champions against Ukraine on Tuesday in a 2-2 draw. Speaking to Rangers TV on Thursday, Gerrard believes his summer signing was rewarded for his current form with the Gers, which has seen him score four goals in 12 matches in all competitions. “He was rewarded for his form as a Rangers player. It was his first call-up so it shows you that he’s at the right place, playing football at the right level. European football, playing in Old Firms, at last, he’s being recognised as an international player,” Gerrard said. “They(NFF) must have started watching him since he started playing at Rangers. They must be happy with him playing in Europa League games, playing in front of 51,000. “I don’t know many players in the Championship who are playing for Nigeria.” Aribo’s attention is now shifted to Rangers upcoming clash with Livingston FC on Saturday.
