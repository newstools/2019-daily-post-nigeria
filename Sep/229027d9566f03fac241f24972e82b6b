The Adamawa State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has inaugurated a special team, named Agro Rangers Squad, to tackle conflicts between herdsmen and farmers in the state. The Commandant of the NSCDC in the state, Nurudeen Abdullahi, assured at the inauguration of the squad that its members had been trained on relevant combat skills to protect grazing reserves across the state. It could be recalled that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo was in the state on Tuesday to flag off implementation of the National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) at Gongoshi Grazing Reserve in Mayo-Belwa LGA, one of five reserves slated for NLTP’s initial implementation across the state. Nurudeen Abdullahi reiterated that the NSCDC conceived the Agro Rangers Squad idea in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, to check constant clashes between farmers and herdsmen. He explained, “The idea to form and train the squad is aimed at lasting solutions to the farmers/herders crisis. I want to assure you that with our special squad, farmers/herders conflicts will be over in Adamawa State.” The Permanent Secretary in charge of Security in Government House, Yola, Ahmadu Baji who represented Governor Umaru Fintiri at the inauguration of the squad, said vehicles were commissioned for distribution to security agencies in the state recently to improve security for all citizens.
