Former England striker, Emile Heskey, has identified Manchester City as the favourite club that can win the English Premier League (EPL) title ahead of Liverpool this season. Liverpool finished one point behind Premier League champions, Manchester City last season but Heskey fears shallow depth in the Reds’ attack will cost Jurgen Klopp’s side this term as they seek to win the English top-flight league for the first time in 30 years. According to Heskey, Pep Guardiola’s men currently have the best squad in terms of depth which gives them an edge over Liverpool to win the EPL title this season. “It’s a tall order for Liverpool because at this moment in time Manchester City have the best squad in terms of depth,” Heskey told Omnisport. “If you take certain players out of City they’ve always got someone who can step in and do a specific job, the way the manager wants him to do it. “Liverpool, if you take Salah, Mane or Firmino out, it’s not quite the same, whereas City have a better blend. “I think City have a better midfield. I’m not saying Liverpool’s midfield is bad, by the way, I’m just saying they have a better blend and they probably give you more goals from midfield. “But if [Liverpool] keep the pressure on like they are doing, you never know.” Liverpool are currently on top of the EPL table with 18 points from six games, while Man City are second placed with 13 points from the same number of matches.
