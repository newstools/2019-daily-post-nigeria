Massimiliano Allegri has hailed Cristiano Ronaldo’s mentality, while the former Juventus head coach believes Inter can win the Scudetto. Ronaldo, who is now 34, has shown no signs of slowing down after joining Juve from LaLiga giants Real Madrid in 2018/2019. Allegri was in charge when Juve prised Ronaldo to Turin last season, with the Portugal captain scoring 21 Serie A goals and 28 in all competitions, as the Italian champions claimed their eighth consecutive Scudetto. “His strength is on a mental level. “He is 34 years old, he has won championships, European titles and golden balls but he continues to give himself important stimuli that make the difference. “The technique is fundamental to stay at high levels for many years, but the difference is made by the head and the professionalism. “If I prefer to coach Ronaldo or a young talent? Ronaldo, without a doubt,” Allegri said according to Goal. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
