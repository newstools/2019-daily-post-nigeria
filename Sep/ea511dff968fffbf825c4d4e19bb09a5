Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has not decided on starting Mason Greenwood against Arsenal. Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford are doubts for the crucial Premier League clash on Monday and Greenwood might be forced to step in. The 17-year-old has scored two goals in his two starts for United this season, but Solskjaer is concerned about overwhelming the striker. “It might be, he’s proven when he’s been on the pitch, Astana and Rochdale, when you get him in the box he’s dangerous. “What’s pleased me about him is he doesn’t turn down chances to finish when you’re not 18 yet and you keep trusting yourself. “So I’m not worried about him at all but we’ve managed him, can’t just throw him in the deep end all the time. “He’s proved in those games he’s ready for it, the Premier League. I’ll have the weekend to think about it,” Solskjaer told reporters in response to whether Greenwood could be an option against Arsenal.
