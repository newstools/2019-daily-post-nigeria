Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has provided the latest update on his team’s plans for their Premier League clash against Arsenal at Old Trafford on Monday night. Solskjaer’s side head to the game following a 2-0 defeat to West Ham United in their last Premier League encounter. “Any injuries?” Solskjaer told MUTV on Friday. “There might be one or two who have not really come back. Paul was really struggling with his ankle as it was really swollen, so let’s see how that repairs. He got 90 minutes but was sore towards the end again. ”Phil will be out until after the international break and, do you know, you have to count these after every game but I think that’s it. “I don’t think we’ll see Anthony before the international break. No, I don’t think so. Luke is improving so, hopefully, we’ll see him.” The kick-off time for the match is 8pm.
