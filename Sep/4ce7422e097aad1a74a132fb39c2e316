Protests rocked Abuja on Wednesday, targeting South African business interests as protesters brought down banners bearing MTN wherever they were seen. Our correspondent who was at the scene at the Federal Housing Junction, Lugbe witnessed how protesters climbed Lona billboard with MTN advert banners and set the banner ablaze. The iron cast billboard was left untouched, but some Police officers watched how the banners were removed and set ablaze. The protest caused nearly 40 minutes traffic as commuters were not allowed passage. A protester speaking with DAILY POST under anonymity blamed Nigeria Parliamentarians for xenophobic attacks on Nigerians in South Africa, saying: “Some of our lawmakers have sold us out cheaply because they are stakeholders in some businesses belonging to South Africa. “The lawmakers cannot react because they are culprits. Are you telling me some of them don’t have shares in MTN? “, he asked. Also at the Dantata bridge in Jabi flyover, MTN banner was seen being burnt with billows of smoke at the time our correspondent passed through the area.
