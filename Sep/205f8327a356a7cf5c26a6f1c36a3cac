Super Eagles winger, Samuel Kalu, is the best dribbler in Europe top five leagues, according to Opta Jean. Kalu, who plays for Bordeaux, is rated ahead of PSG’s Angel Di Maria, Arsenal’s Nicolas Pepe and Real Betis’ Nabil Fekir. The 22-year-old played a vital role in their 2-0 victory over Metz in Saturday’s Ligue 1 clash at Matmut Atlantique. Kalu has successfully executed 22 dribbles out of 47 attempted, putting him ahed of Arsenal’s Pepe, who has completed 19 dribbles. Fekir, who plays for Real Betis, is just behind that at 18 out of 25, with PSG’s Di Maria’s 18 over 41 dribbles rounding out the top four.
