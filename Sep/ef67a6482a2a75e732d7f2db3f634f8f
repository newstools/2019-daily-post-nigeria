TalkSport host, Adrian Durham, has told Arsenal to fire manager Unai Emery and bring in Jose Mourinho. The Gunners squandered a two-goal half-time lead on Sunday, to draw 2-2 with Watford. And that performance has led Durham to question whether Emery, is the right man to lead a new era in north London. “Time is running out for Unai Emery. “He’s coming up to the end of the two years and there is no difference to the darkest days under Arsene Wenger. “They conceded more chances to Watford than they did in the 8-2 at Man United. “So these are just as bad these times for Arsenal and they are nowhere nearer challenging for the title than they were in those latter years under Wenger. “It’s a fanbase and a club that is living a delusion that their players are really good. “The midfield and the defending is not good enough and I’m not even sure about the goalkeeper. It looks like they’re not being coached correctly or told the right things. “Something drastic needs to be done,” Durham said.
