The National and State House of Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Asaba, on Saturday, upheld the election of Senator Peter Nwaoboshi as senator representing Delta North Senatorial District at the National Assembly. The tribunal, in a unanimous decision, dismissed the petition filed by Doris Uboh of the All Progressives Congress (APC), for being statute barred and lacking in merit. Chairman of the three-man panel, Justice E.I. Ngene, said there was merit in the objection raised by Senator Nwaoboshi against the competence of the petition and jurisdiction of the tribunal to entertain it having been filed outside the time provided for by law.. Justice Ngene said that the tribunal found that none of the allegations of malpractices made by the petitioner was substantiated or proved beyond any reasonable doubt. Uboh scored about 30,000 votes,while Nwaoboshi polled over 180,000 votes at the election held on February 23, 2019.
