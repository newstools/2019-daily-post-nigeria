Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has revealed it was Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s decision to hand over penalties duties to Nicolas Pepe, during Arsenal’s thrilling 3-2 win over Aston Villa. Pepe scored his first goal for the Gunners from the spot, in the second half of a pulsating game with Villa. But fans were surprised to see the former Lille winger step up to take the penalty. Aubameyang is Arsenal’s usual penalty taker and Emery confirmed after the game his top goalscorer handed over the responsibility to Pepe. He told Sky Sports: “Today it was a very big decision from Aubameyang to let [Pepe] shoot.” Arsenal played the entire second half with 10 men, after Ainsley Maitland-Niles was sent off and Villa restored their lead just 89 seconds after Pepe’s spot-kick.
