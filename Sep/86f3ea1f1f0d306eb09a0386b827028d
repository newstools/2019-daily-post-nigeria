Femi Adesina, special adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on media and publicity, has taken a swipe at the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for saying that the president’s trip to the 7th Tokyo International Conference on African Development was “a poor and disgraceful outing”. The opposition party had on Sunday alleged that President Muhammadu Buhari received poor attention from world leaders and investors at the 7th Tokyo International Conference on Africa Development. It also said the alleged poor outing was an indication of rejection by the international community. The party’s spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan who said this in a statement added, “The party describes as a national embarrassment and shame that President Buhari could not seal any meaningful economic agreement at the conference but only came home with an empty basket and pocket full of promissory notes.” But reacting via Twitter, Adesina described members of the major opposition party as “hallucinating” According to him, those speaking from PDP headquarters were speaking gibberish Adesina on his official Twitter page wrote: “In PDP’s hallucinations, TICAD 7 was not a success for Nigeria since PMB came back with only ‘promissory notes. “Did they think it was a buying and selling session? Wadata House must now be Hammer House of Horror, and anybody operating from there simply talks gibberish.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
