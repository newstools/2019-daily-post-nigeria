The Co-founder of BudgIT joined the Buhari administration as the Technical Adviser at the Ministry of Budget and National Planning and confirmed the development through his Medium’s account after deactivating his Twitter account. His appointment by the same government he had criticized in the past four years generated controversies as the development did not go down well with some Nigerians.

Kudos Onigbinde.” Also, popular Nigerian Actor/singer, Banky Wellington condemned Onigbinde’s resignation. Lamenting, Banky W in a post on his Twitter page said Nigeria has lost a “great opportunity to have someone to hold accountable in office.” On his Twitter page, he wrote: “This makes me sad. Our country would be better off if our brightest minds are serving in government, not just criticizing from the outside. “Onigbinde has been a voice for accountability and transparency, we’ve lost a golden opportunity to have someone we can actually hold accountable in office.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
