The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has said that President Muhammadu Buhari does not know where he kept his WAEC certificate. Controversies have continued to surround President Buhari’s educational qualification with the belief in some quarters that he (Buhari) does not possess a senior secondary school result. President Buhari himself had recently told the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal Court, PEPTC, that there is no law in Nigeria that requires him to produce his certificates in a bid to prove his eligibility to run for Presidency. Buhari argued that under the 1999 Constitution, he was only required to be educated. And, appearing on Channels Television on Thursday, Lai Mohammed argued that a man who finished secondary school since about 53 years ago may not have known where he kept his WAEC certificate. He pleaded with Nigerians to pardon President Buhari, according to Mohammed, “53 years after a fellow has left secondary school. 53 years, I think we should pardon him. Because has not even known where he kept it.” VIDEO…   #LaiMohammed says Nigerians should pardon President Buhari over his certificate. Says it’s been 53 years.
