The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Adams Ohiomhole, has insisted that the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, has done well in the past three years. Oshiomhole said even the enemies of the All Progressives Congress, APC, would agree that Bello has done well, especially in the area of security. The APC National Chairman spoke at the party’s headquarters in Abuja during a meeting of the National Working Committee of the party with the governorship aspirants in the state, on Thursday. Oshiomhole stated that the Kogi State Governor has achieved more in three and a half years in the state than other governors recorded in the previous 13 years. According to Oshiomhole, “You will score the current governor higher if we must tell ourselves the truth. “Bello did not only inherit salary arrears from his predecessors which he had defrayed but also inherited burdens of infrastructure, projects approved and money paid but were not executed and the governor is doing all such projects today. ”Even our party’s enemies will agree with us that Yahaya Bello has done well in the area of security. If the people are not secured, no meaningful development can take place. ”I have people who live in Kogi State and we all know the level of insecurity in that state before. But today you can all agree with me that the current governor has addressed the issue of security in Kogi. “We have had an extensive conversation as APC family to touch issues that arose from the primaries in Kogi. ”Aspirants have spoken their minds and we have heard them as National Working Committee of the party. ”I am glad to let you know that all our aspirants including those that were disqualified and those that contested and lost, have agreed to work with Governor Yahaya Bello, who is the APC flag bearer.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
