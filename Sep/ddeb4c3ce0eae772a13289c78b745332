Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has named his squad for this season’s Champions League. The Blues, like everyone else, have a List A group and a List B group. Each club must name a maximum of 25 players, two of whom must be goalkeepers. There are a minimum of eight places reserved exclusively for ‘locally trained players’. If a club have fewer than eight locally trained players in their squad, then the maximum number of players on List A is reduced accordingly. Chelsea will play Valencia, Lille and Ajax in Group H. The Chelsea squad Goalkeepers: Kepa, Caballero, Cumming*. Defenders: Azpilicueta, Emerson, James*, Alonso, Rudiger, Christensen, Zouma, Tomori, Guehi*.
