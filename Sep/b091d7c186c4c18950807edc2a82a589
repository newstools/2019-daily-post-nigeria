Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) Lagos command has arrested a 46 years old man, Mr. Chinedu Ifeleka, for sexually abusing his 14-year-old daughter, Chinwendu Ifeleka at Mapowu street, Ojo. Kehinde Mary Bada, Public Relations Officer of the command, on Monday, said Chinedu started abusing the victim in 2016. “This incidence according to the daughter happened twice when she was 11 years old. The victim said she reported to her mother but no action was taken”, the spokesman said. In her statement, Chiwendu said her father sexually abused her again on the 9th of August, 2019 while her mother was away at her paternal grandmother’s place. She disclosed that her father woke her up at about 2.25am and started touching her inappropriately after which he had carnal knowledge of her. The girl said she reported again to her mother. The suspect, in his statement, admitted to committing the crime but insisted he had carnal knowledge of his daughter once. The victim’s mother, Mrs. Florence Ifeleka, in a separate statement, said she was scared to report the first two incidences because the suspect, her husband threatened to deal with her ruthlessly if she did. The Commandant, Mr. Cyprian E Otoibhi, told newsmen that, “the suspect will face the full wrath of the law and will be handed over to the appropriate agency for further investigation and prosecution.” He further stated that this is a heinous crime and all perpetrators of such, when caught will be made to pay dearly. Reiterating the corps’ mandate of protection of critical infrastructure as well as protection of lives and property, the Commandant said the Corps will not rest on its oars in ensuring a crime-free Lagos.
