Premier League giants, Manchester United have identified two goalkeepers as David De Gea’s possible replacement at Old Trafford. De Gea’s current deal at United expires at the end of the season, but despite holding extensive talks with the Red Devils, an agreement over a new deal has yielded no results yet. Man United have offered the Spaniard a deal worth £350,000 a week, which would make him the highest-paid goalkeeper in the world. But De Gea has told friends he is “willing to snub” the offer. However, The Athletic is now reporting that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side want Everton’s Jordan Pickford and Atletico Madrid’s Jan Oblak as De Gea’s likely replacement if the 28-year-old fails to sign a new deal with the club. De Gea has drawn interest from Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus in recent weeks. Man United will tackle Leicester City in the Premier League this weekend at Old Trafford.
