We advise Nigerians living at home and abroad to be good and law abiding,” they said. The catholic bishops also urged the Federal Government to continue to do more in the fight against insecurity. “We reiterate that without adequate security of lives and property, there can be no stability and enabling environment for meaningful development. “We urge government at all levels to provide an enabling environment that will make it possible for both the government and the private sector to create job opportunities for our teeming youths. “This will certainly minimise the menace of insecurity in our land, ” the communique added.
