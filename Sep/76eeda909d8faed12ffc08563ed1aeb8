La Liga president, Javier Tebas, has disclosed that he wants both Juventus superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo and former Manchester United manager, Jose Mourinho back in the Spanish top-flight league. According to him, Ronaldo and Mourinho are ‘great’ personalities that will promote the La Liga. Ronaldo, a former Real Madrid star, left the Santiago Bernabeu during the summer of 2018 transfer window, while Mourinho, a former Real Madrid coach, left the club in 2013. But Tebas is now saying that the door will always be open for the two iconic figures to return to the league. “I would like to have Cristiano Ronaldo back and for Jose Mourinho to be coaching a Spanish team,” Tebas told Canal 11. “He’s a great coach and a great name to promote our league.” Tebas added: “I thought that his departure would affect us more, to be honest. However, I prefer the Spanish league with Ronaldo in it than without. “The Premier League for many years had no Ballon d’Or winners but was still the best league in the world. “That’s a great job on many levels.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
