Juventus superstar, Cristiano Ronald, on Tuesday won a record 10th Portuguese Player of the Year award. The 34-year-old beat Atletico Madrid’s Joao Felix and Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva, to win the award. Speaking after winning the award at the Carlos Lopes Pavilion in Lisbon, Ronaldo said: “This world is so fast, with the social media, the press, it’s been wild. “It’s been an extremely complicated year on a personal level. Don’t let anyone pull you down. “I can’t help but mention that Sporting deserves a little prize. Next time.” Ronaldo was included in FIFA’s final three-man shortlist for the Men’s Player of the Year award. The former Real Madrid star missed out on the UEFA Player of the Year award to Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk last week.
