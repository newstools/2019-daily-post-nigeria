Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate, Cindy has won this week’s Head of House, HoH, challenge for the ‘Pepper Dem’ edition of the reality TV show. The position of HoH is usually assumed by the winner of the weekly task as instructed by Biggie. Last week, for the first time in the history of Big Brother Naija, two housemates emerged heads of house for the week; they were Ike and Mercy. In today’s task, housemates were assigned BBNaija’s throw balls challenge, where housemates were to throw balls across the holahup and the housemate with least balls emerge the winner. Some housemates, after several attempts, fell behind in the course of the game, leaving Frodd, Mercy, Cindy and Dianne to the final rounds of the puzzle challenge. In the final rounds, the remaining housemates were asked to fill up the test-tubes with a spoon from bowls across the room. Cindy, however, emerged winner as she was the fastest housemate to fill up the test tube. According to Big Brother, the HoH gets the honour of sitting on the Head of House seat, 250 coins, as well as the luxury of a tastefully furnished Head of House bedroom. Cindy decided to share the luxury of the Head of House bedroom with fellow housemate, Mike. Cindy’s emergence is coming just a day after Venita got evicted.
