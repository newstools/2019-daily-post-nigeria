The UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has announced the return of the two-year post-study work visa for international students. According to BBC news, the new immigration route announced on Wednesday means that graduates in any subject will once again be able to stay in the UK for two years to find work after they graduate. Currently, most international students reading bachelor’s and master’s degrees can stay and work for only four months. The move reverses a decision made in 2012 by the home secretary Theresa May, who abolished the two-year post-study work visa that had made Britain an attractive place for international students, saying it was ‘too generous’. That led to a sharp drop in students going to Britain. The new immigration route will be available to international students who have successfully completed a course in any subject at undergraduate level or higher level at a Higher Education Provider which has a proven track record in upholding immigration checks and other rules on studying in the UK. Also, students will need to have Tier 4 leave at the point the route is introduced. This includes students who start courses in 2020/21 at undergraduate level or above. The new route enables eligible students to work or look for work, at any skill level, for two years after they graduate before needing to convert to another visa or having to leave the country. According to the Prime Minister, this change would see students “unlock their potential” and begin careers in the UK.
