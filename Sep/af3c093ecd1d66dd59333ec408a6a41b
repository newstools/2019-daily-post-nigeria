The governorship primary election of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, ended abruptly in the early hours of Wednesday when gunmen invaded the venue of the election, Lokoja Confluence Stadium. Gov. Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa is Chairman of the Electoral Committee. A correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that voting had ended and sorting of votes were going on when the gunmen came to the venue at about 1:45a.m. and started shooting from different directions. Votes in eight out of the 10 ballot boxes have already been counted and sorted out before the disruption by the gunmen. Aspirants, delegates and others scampered for safety while the number of casualty has yet to be ascertained. The winner of the primary will slug it out with incumbent governor, Yahaya Bello, who won the All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket last week.
