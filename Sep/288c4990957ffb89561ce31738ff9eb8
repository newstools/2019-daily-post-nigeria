Shkodran Mustafi has said he will not go “to war” with Arsenal over his future. The German defender looked set to leave the Emirates during the summer, having been told by manager Unai Emery, that it would be best for his career to move on. But a transfer didn’t materialise for the German defender, who has two years left on his contract in North London. And on Thursday night, he made his first appearance of the season, as the Gunners began their Europa League campaign with a 3-0 win away to Eintracht Frankfurt. And speaking to Sport Bild after the game, the World Cup winner said: “My father, who is my agent, spoke to the club. “I am an Arsenal player and still have two years left on my contract. “I‘ve never been someone who begins a war when something doesn‘t work out. “I always said: If it is possible, I am open to take the next step. If not, I keep playing my football. “The manager [Emery] said he sees me the same way he sees every player in the team. That‘s why I played today and that‘s it. “We are going to see what the future holds.” Asked about the prospect of a possible move to the Bundesliga, Mustafi added: “I won‘t say, that it isn‘t a thing but I am always what makes sense for me. I got a wife and two kids, so they have to agree as well. “When a German club shows interest and it suits me, then I am open for it.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
