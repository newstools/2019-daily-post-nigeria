Thierry Henry’s former Arsenal and France team-mate, Robert Pires, has said he deserves a second shot at management and could get that opportunity in the Premier League. Henry flopped during his first foray into coaching with Monaco. Having cut his teeth alongside Roberto Martinez in the Belgium national team set-up, he returned to his roots at Monaco in October 2018. The World Cup winner lasted just 20 games in that post, collecting only four wins, it was quickly decided that he was not the right man for the job. “I saw Thierry a few weeks ago for the game against Tottenham at the Emirates and he is waiting. “He is waiting for something, for the new challenge. “Some people say ‘Yeah, but he was a mistake with Monaco’. I say no. “When you start like this, like Thierry, if you have only three months it’s so difficult to prove something. And especially at this moment. Monaco were so bad, it was so difficult, they had a lot of injuries,” Pires, a fellow member of Arsenal’s ‘Invincibles’ squad from 2003-04, told Reuters.
