Jama’tu Nasril Islam, JNI, has called for caution and restraint on the part of Muslims Ummah on their reaction to the alleged demolition of Trans-Amadi’s Mosque in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. Secretary-General, JNI, Dr. Khalid Abubakar Aliyu, in a statement issued in Kaduna Friday, said, “At trying moments such as this, Muslims should be guided by the Qur’anic teaching of introspection and perseverance, truthfulness and sincerity. “Such stand fetches for them Allah’s guidance on how the situation would be approached and solved.” JNI added, “The approach is to enable the Muslim Ummah come together in unity under its leadership, which I swear in the name of Allah the Exalted, right from the time the dastard act of the Trans-Amadi Mosque demolition took place, is working round the clock in finding lasting solutions with wisdom, for what the Rivers state government did, unfortunately, in order to forestall future occurrence of such abominable act in Rivers state and anywhere in Nigeria.” The statement called on Muslims to be calm and be prayerful, stressing that the leadership seeks for concordant and accordant redress, within the shortest possible time frame in-sha-Allah.
