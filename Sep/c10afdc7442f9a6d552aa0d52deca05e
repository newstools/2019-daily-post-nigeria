Popular Nigerian cross-dresser, Idris Okuneye popularly known as Bobrisky has broken silence on the closure of the venue of his birthday party. DAILY POST had reported that the Nigeria police raided a nude party organised by Bobrisky in Lekki area of Lagos State. Bobrisky put up the party in celebration of his 28th birthday, but it was disrupted by the Nigeria police, who invaded the place and dispersed guests. Photos and a video of the event centre showed several police vehicles stationed around the venue. However, the cross-dresser, who recently revealed that he has cut off his penis was said to have left his event centre before the police stormed the place. Five people were said to have been arrested. Reacting, Bobrisky in a post on his Snapchat apologised to friends and family who showed up for his party. He wrote: “I’m a hard rock, nothing can break me. Love you all. “I know it’s painful especially to those of you who travelled to Nigeria to celebrate me. Don’t worry, I got you all.” Recall that the Federal Government through the Director-General of the National Council for Arts and Culture, Otunba Olusegun had threatened to deal with Bobrisky. He said, “Bobrisky is a national disgrace. He started by selling and using bleaching creams, now, he has grown boobs, bums and hips.”  Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
