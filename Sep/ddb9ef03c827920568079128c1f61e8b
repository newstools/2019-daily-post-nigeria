The All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, has said that it is committed to zoning the governorship seat of Anambra State to the Southern Senatorial zone. The State Secretary of the party, Barr Tony Ifeanya, stated this while featuring in a radio programme monitored by DAILY POST in Awka, Anambra State. Ifeanya, reiterated his party’s belief in the zoning and rotation of the office of the governor of Anambra among the three senatorial districts of the state. He said, “Justice, equity, fairness and good conscience demand that Governor Willie Obiano’s successor should emerge from Anambra South Senatorial District.” Ifeanya said the party will pursue the part of rotation of power among the zones, not minding some people who were working to scuttle the peace of the state by changing the rotation pattern. He also added that his party has mapped out strategies to continue with its winning streak in the state, and also ensure that it wins over the party in 2021, when the governorship election would be held. He said, “Strategies to accomplish the objective were extensively discussed during a recent retreat of the party at Nibo in Awka South Local Government Area, with the theme; “Thirteen Years of APGA Glorious Governments in Anambra State: Need for Sustainability”. “Ndi Anambra are assured of the determination of APGA government in the state to sustain the tempo of delivery of democracy dividends. We are also mindful of the present deplorable condition of some roads, and would effectively tackle them immediately after the rainy season.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
