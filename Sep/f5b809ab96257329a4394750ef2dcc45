Chelsea defender, Fikayo Tomori, has said he would be willing to play for the Super Eagles. The 21-year-old, however, insisted he has not decided which country to choose. Tomori is eligible play for Nigeria, where his parents are from, Canada, where he was born and England where he currently lives. According to him, his choice might be determined by which of the countries give him a call-up. “I’m a citizen of all three (countries) so we’ll see. I was born in Canada and lived there about seven or eight months old. My family is Nigerian, obviously I live in England. “It’s nice to have that. I can’t play Under-21 football anymore so the last international break I didn’t get called up to anyone. Next one maybe we’ll see,” Dailymail quoted the defender as saying.
