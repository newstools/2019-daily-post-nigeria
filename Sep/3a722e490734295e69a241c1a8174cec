Paris Saint-Germain manager, Thomas Tuchel, has hailed winger, Angel Di Maria following his impressive performance in his side’s UEFA Champions League 3-0 win over Real Madrid on Wednesday night. Tuchel described Di Maria’s display against Zinedine Zidane’s side as “exceptional,” adding that the 31-year-old was always dangerous with the ball. Di Maria, a former Real Madrid player, scored a brace against the Los Blancos before Thomas Meunier’s late strike sealed the victory for PSG. “We can’t be too surprised because Di Maria has been showing for more than a year now that he is capable of performances like that,” Tuchel told reporters after the match. “He was exceptional tonight. He is always dangerous.” Tuchel added: “Everyone was saying how could we win with all these players out but maybe that meant we were not the favourites and it can also help when you don’t feel too much pressure.” PSG will now play against Lyon in their next fixture in Ligue 1 on Sunday.
