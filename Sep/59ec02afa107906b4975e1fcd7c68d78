Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has said the club-record signing, Nicolas Pepe, needs to complete his adaptation to the Premier League “quickly”. The 24-year-old, who moved to the Emirates from Lille in a £72million deal, has made three starts in his six Gunners appearances so far, but only has one assist to show for his performances. Emery has called for him to step up during Sunday’s home game against Aston Villa. “He needs more adaptation. He is playing good but progressively we know there is going to be more performance in him to help us and I want to do now quickly the last step in the adaptation for us, for example, against Aston Villa. ‘We are working with him first for that adaptation. “After the training now we are watching individual videos with him, also to push him to achieve the details tactically we need for him because he is playing well but also we need in our organisation to be strong with every player to improve a lot,” Emery said in his pre-match press conference. Pepe starred for Lille in Ligue 1 last season, with his 22 goals and 11 assists, putting him behind only Kylian Mbappe in the league’s golden boot.
