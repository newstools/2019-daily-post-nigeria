Cameroon legend, Samuel Eto’o, has said he would like to see Jose Mourinho manage Barcelona in future. The Portuguese tactician had a spell at Camp Nou, after arriving in 1996 as Bobby Robson’s interpreter and assistant. After leaving Barca, Mourinho went on to become a top-tier manager and enjoyed successes in Portugal, Italy, Spain and England. Eto’o spent five years at Barca, before leaving for Inter Milan in 2009, where he played under the 56-year-old, winning the 2010 Champions League trophy. “It would be beautiful [Mourinho’s return to Barcelona]. “I’d like to ask Jose to come to Mallorca, that would be good, the best city in Spain. But I’d like him at Barca even more,” Eto’o said as reported by Sport. Eto’o also described the former Manchester United manager as one of the best people in football. “I’m sick of saying that this guy is one of the best people in the world of football. I ended my career and the first person to send me a message was this man,” he added.
