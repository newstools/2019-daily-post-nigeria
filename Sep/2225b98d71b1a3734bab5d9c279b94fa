Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has called on Eden Hazard to show his strengths in Saturday’s derby against Atletico Madrid. Hazard, who joined Madrid from Chelsea for a fee that could reach £130 million, missed the first three LaLiga games of the season due to a thigh injury. He has since made three appearances and is yet to score, but Zidane said he is confident of success despite the slow start. “We know the calibre of player we have. “He will show it at any moment. He did in [the 1-0 win against] Sevilla. “Of course, everyone expects more from him and he is aware of that. We are behind him and he is with us. We just have to take it match by match because he is going to be the player we want with us, for sure,” Zidane said during a news conference on Friday.
