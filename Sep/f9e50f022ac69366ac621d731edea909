Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has said that he is not sure if the club did everything to bring Neymar back from Paris Saint-Germain. In an interview with Sport, Messi admitted he would have enjoyed having Neymar back at Camp Nou, but understood the difficulties of the transfer window. “I would have liked for Neymar to have returned. “Honestly, I’m not sure if Barca did all they could to sign him but I know it is difficult to negotiate with PSG. “I am not disappointed. We have a spectacular squad that can challenge for all, even without Ney,” he said. Neymar only left Barca two years ago in a world-record €222million move but was keen to return. Although the LaLiga champions made several offers for the Brazilian, he will be staying in Paris until next year at least. “Neymar is one of the best in the world. With his level and sponsors, it would have been a big gain for the club,” Messi added.
