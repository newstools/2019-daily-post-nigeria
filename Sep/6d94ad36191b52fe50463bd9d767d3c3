Former Manchester United captain, Roy Keane, has pointed the finger at David de Gea, after a disappointing 2-0 defeat to West Ham on Sunday. Keane, speaking on Sky Sports, said he has never been convinced by the Spain international’s mental strength and questioned his ability to command a defence. Goals from Andriy Yarmolenko and Aaron Cresswell added to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s woes on Sunday, leaving his side languishing in eighth place in the Premier League. “I’m not sure. I’m worried about his (De Gea’s) character. “He never seems to be commanding. I don’t get that impression. He makes mistakes. “The big test is how you react after a mistake, he’s making far too many. “I’m never convinced by the character side of him. Is he the package? I’ve always had my question marks over him.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
