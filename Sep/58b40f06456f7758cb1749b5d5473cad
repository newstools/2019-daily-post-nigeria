Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi has been named the 2019 FIFA Men’s Best Player of the Year. The Argentine captain won the prize on Monday at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, Italy ahead of Liverpool defender, Virgil van Dijk and Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo. Messi had an impressive 2018/2019 campaign with Barca, as he finished highest goal scorer in the Champions League. The 32-year-old also won the La Liga title with Barcelona last season. He, however, missed out on this year’s UEFA Champions League Men’s Player of the Year award to Van Dijk.
