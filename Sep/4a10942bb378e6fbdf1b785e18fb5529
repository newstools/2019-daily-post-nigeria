The Delta State Police Command has said only two persons were allegedly abducted by gunmen around the Ughelli/Agbarho section of the East-West road in Ughelli Local Government Area of Delta State. The Commissioner of Police, CP Adeyinka Adeleke made the assertion contrary to speculations that four persons were abducted by the gunmen. CP Adeleke in a telephone chat with DAILY POST said, “A man and his driver” were abducted on the road. He said his men responded timely to save the situation which occurred at about 6:40 pm on Monday evening. CP Adeleke noted that efforts are being made to rescue the victims. It was learnt that the hoodlums numbering about twenty fled the scene after a gun duel with heavily armed policemen numbering over thirty along the highway. While the gunshots lasted, motorists abandoned their vehicles for fear of being hit by bullets. It would be recalled that some persons, including the Personal Assistant to the Bishop of Flock of Christ Mission, Simeon Okah, were abducted at the same spot nearly two months back. They were released after an undisclosed amount was allegedly paid as ransom for their release.
