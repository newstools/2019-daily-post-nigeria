But, not satisfied with the result, the candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Mustapha Ajibola Azeez approached the election petition tribunal, urging the tribunal to declare him (Azeez) as the winner of the election. Azeez in his argument insisted that there were irregularities in the election March 9th election, as he urged the tribunal to nullify Olayanju’s declaration. The petitioner, Azeez in his petition EPT/OY/SHA/30/2019; Hon Azeez v Olayanju, (IREPO/OLORUNSOGO) said he was the authentic winner of the said election. The tribunal, however, Saturday evening, declared Ajibola as the winner and nullified Olayanju’s declaration.
