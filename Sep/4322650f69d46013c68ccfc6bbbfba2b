The Jigawa State Police Command has confirmed the death of one person and several others injured in a farmers/herders clash in Iggi Village area of Bininkudu Local Government Area of the state. The Commissioner of Police, Bala Zama, confirmed this to newsmen in Dutse on Wednesday. He said the dispute erupted over ownership of Yabaza forest between Fulani herdsmen and indigenous farmers around Iggi village, which former claimed to have owned for over 100 years. “The clash started when the farmers in the area attacked the Fulanis after they have come back from grazing, in retaliation the Fulani also attacked the village.” He said those injured were already taken by the police to hospital for medical attention. The commissioner said police personnel were deployed to calm the situation and arrest those suspected to have committed the offence. He commended the efforts of Jigawa State Government and traditional rulers for their commitments to solving the lingering land disputes between farmers and herders in the area. Chairman of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association in Jigawa, Mr. Sa’idu Musa Gagarawa, told DAILY POST that , it was a reprisal attack after two Fulani were severely beaten by farmers from Dagalma community. ”Two Fulani men were found soak in blood after being beaten by the farmers, and that was what prompted some Fulani youths to embark on a reprisal, which resulted to the unfortunate death of one person,” he stated. Mr. Sa’idu added that the dispute on the grazing land assigned to Fulani for several years has been resolved by the community leaders only for the farmers to rekindle the issue now.
