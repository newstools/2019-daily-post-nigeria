Manchester United centre-back, Harry Maguire has called on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men to build on their win over Leicester City after their Saturday’s Premier League 1-0 victory at Old Trafford. Marcus Rashford scored from the spot to give Solskjaer’s side all three points against the Foxes. Maguire, who joined Man United from Leicester City in the summer transfer window, wants the Red Devils to continue to keep ‘clean sheet’ at Old Trafford after defeating his former side. “It was tough playing against Jamie [Vardy]. I’ve played with him for two years and he is a top player who can terrorise defences when he is on his game,” Maguire was quoted by Metro UK as saying after the match. “We knew it was important to get the win, especially after the international break. “We have to build on a solid base and we want to keep clean sheets, especially at Old Trafford. “We are always going to score goals with the attacking talent we have. We could have kept the ball better but we defended well. “The boys who came in looked sharp and fit and a big well done to them. “We have games coming thick and fast and I’m sure the manager will utilise the squad, so be patient and take you chance when you get it.” Man United will take on West Ham United in their next Premier League fixture on September 22.
