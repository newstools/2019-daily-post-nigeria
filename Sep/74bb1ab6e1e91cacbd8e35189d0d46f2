Chelsea Manager, Frank Lampard has ruled out the possibility of playing midfielder, N’Golo Kante in his side’s Premier League clash against Wolves at Molineux on Saturday. According to him, the France international is yet to recover from an ankle injury, while the likes of Antonio Rudiger, Mateo Kovacic and Pedro are all fit to play against Wolves. Chelsea head to the game following a 2-2 draw against Sheffield United in their last Premier League encounter. “Rudiger is fit to play,’ Lampard was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as saying on Friday in his pre-match press conference. “He’s been very important for the club and the team since he’s been here with his personality, character and quality and we’ve missed him. Everyone talks about how young we are and how young we’re becoming so we need leaders within that and Rudiger needs to take on the responsibility of being a leader for us. “Kovacic and Pedro are fit to play but N’Golo is not fit yet. He still has issues with his ankle and the medical team are working with him. He’s in a bit of a transitional period now where we’re trying to get him on the pitch and he’s doing some physical work but this game comes too soon for him.
