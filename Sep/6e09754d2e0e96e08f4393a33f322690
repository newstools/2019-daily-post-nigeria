Paul Pogba and his agent, Mino Raiola are set to demand a yearly salary of €35milllion from Manchester United, according Okdiario. The massive sum would give the France midfielder a weekly wage of over €600,000. It is believed that the demand, is a way to force United’s hand and allow Pogba to move to Real Madrid before his current contract expires. The 26-year-old is contracted at Old Trafford until 2021, meaning the club may be forced to sell him in the next year, to ensure he doesn’t leave for free. Pogba was desperate to leave England this summer, with Real and Juventus interested in his services. However, no deal has materialized, although both clubs might rekindle their interest next year.
