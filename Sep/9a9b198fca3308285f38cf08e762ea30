The acting chairman, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, has called on the Theatre Commander of the Operation Lafiya Dole of the Nigerian Army, Major General Olusegun Adeniyi, to ensure that Organizations moving cash in the Northeast secure clearance from the EFCC, as part of measures to check terrorist financing in the region. Magu, who spoke through Lawrence Iwodi, head of EFCC Maiduguri Zonal office, during a courtesy visit to the Theatre Command of the Operation Lafiya Dole at Maimalari Barrack, Maiduguri, commended the efforts of the command in the fight against insurgency. He disclosed that the Commission has been keeping eye on the activities of persons and groups serving as humanitarian or aid workers within the region. “We have successfully compiled the list of all the Non- governmental organisations operating in Borno and Yobe States; also their financial activities are monitored by the EFCC, especially on the movement of cash”, he said. According to him, the EFCC has been monitoring undeclared cash above N1million (One Million Naira), by individuals and organizations in Borno and Yobe states, adding that the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria(FAAN) has also ensured that such cash movements are reported.
