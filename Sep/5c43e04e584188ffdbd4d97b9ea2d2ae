The first batch of 550 pilgrims from Yobe State who participated in the 2019 Hajj exercise Sunday, safely returned to Nigeria via Maiduguri International Airport. DAILY POST learnt that, Yobe State has more than 1,200 pilgrims who took part in the annual religious rite in Saudi Arabia this year. Alhaji Kachalla Jumbam, one of the pilgrims from the state appreciated the manner in which the 2019 Hajj exercise had been coordinated by the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) in partnership with the State Pilgrims’ Commission, saying they deserve commendations. “During our stay in the Holy land, we have prayed for our dear state and the country in general, asking God to intervene over the numerous security challenges rocking different parts of Nigeria”, Jumbam stated. According to him, no pilgrim from Yobe State has been found wanting during the exercise as they have abided the Saudi’s rules and regulations. It was gathered that, more pilgrims from the state are expected to be airlifted back home within the week.
