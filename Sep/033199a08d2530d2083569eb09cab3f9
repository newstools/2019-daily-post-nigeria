Chelsea left-back, Emerson Palmieri, has provided an update on his injury ahead of his side’s Premier League clash against Wolves this weekend. The 25-year-old limped off after just seven minutes of Italy’s Euro 2020 qualifier at Finland on Sunday night. Emerson, who has been in good form for Frank Lampard’s side so far this season, started alongside Blues team-mate Jorginho. But he was replaced by Roma’s Alessandro Florenzi with the game in its early stages. Providing an update on his injury, Emerson wrote on his official Twitter page, “Very important victory today guys. “Unfortunately I had a small injury, but nothing serious. Let’s continue like this!” Meanwhile, Italy coach, Roberto Mancini has already confirmed that Emerson’s injury was not serious. Mancini told reporters after the match: “It was nothing serious, he stopped to ensure it didn’t get any worse.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
