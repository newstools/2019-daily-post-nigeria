Juventus are keeping tabs on three Manchester United players ahead of next summer, according to Gazzetta Dello Sport. The three players listed in the report are: David de Gea, Eric Bailly and Nemanja Matic. Juve used the free transfer market to their advantage this summer, by signing Aaron Ramsey from Arsenal, after the expiration of his contract. And it appears the Italian champions are already drawing up a shortlist of players, who will be available for nothing in a year’s time, if they fail to sign a new contract. Among them are David Silva and Christian Eriksen, who are both set to bid farewell to their current clubs at the end of the campaign.
