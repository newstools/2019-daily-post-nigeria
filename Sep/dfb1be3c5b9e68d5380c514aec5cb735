Chelsea could be without Antonio Rudiger, Emerson Palmieri and Ruben Loftus-Cheek due to injury when they take on Valencia in their UEFA Champions League opener on Tuesday night at Stamford Bridge. Rudiger, Palmieri and Loftus-Cheek missed the Blues’ training on Monday morning ahead of Valencia clash. Chelsea made this known in a statement on the club’s official website on Monday. “A group of 22 players trained at Cobham this morning as Frank Lampard put his side through their paces ahead of our Champions League opener against Valencia on Tuesday, though Antonio Rudiger was absent following his half-time withdrawal at Wolves. “The German started for the first time this season at Molineux after recovering from the knee injury sustained late last season, though he was replaced at the break by Kurt Zouma, with Lampard explaining afterwards that the centre-back had troubled a problem in his groin late in the first half. “Emerson Palmieri and Ruben Loftus-Cheek were the other members of our Champions League A List squad to miss out on training ahead of matchday one, although there was better news with the sight of N’Golo Kante, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Reece James joining the main group from the start,” the statement reads. The kick-off time for the match is 8pm. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
