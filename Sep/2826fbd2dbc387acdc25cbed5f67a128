Brazilian star, Philippe Coutinho, has insisted that Bayern Munich is ‘like family’ to him. According to Coutinho, the people living in Bayern Munich are very open-hearted, adding that they gave him and his family a great welcome. The 27-year-old joined Bayern from Barcelona on loan in the summer transfer window. The midfielder scored his first goal for the club in their 4-0 victory over Cologne some few days ago. “From time to time I went for a walk with my family. The city is very beautiful. The people here are very open-hearted,” Coutinho told Bundesliga’s official website. “Thiago helped me a lot with the language. He’s helped me every day on and off the field. “Everyone gave us a great welcome. I think that’s the principle of the club [Bayern Munich]. It’s like a family.” Coutinho will hope to lead Bayern to victory when they tackle Paderborn on Saturday in the Bundesliga.
