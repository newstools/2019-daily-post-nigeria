Real Madrid are on the verge of wrapping up a £64million deal for Sporting Lisbon midfielder, Bruno Fernandes, according to ESPN. The LaLiga giants will announce the signing on deadline day (Monday). Fernandes recently revealed he had agreed to join Tottenham in the summer, but the deal fell through after the two clubs failed to reach an agreement. The Portugal international has now reportedly signed on the dotted line for Madrid and will be confirmed as a Real player after all the details are finalised. Zinedine Zidane has been in the market for an attacking midfielder this summer and opted for a last-minute move for Fernandes, after failing in bids to sign Paul Pogba, Christian Eriksen and Donny van de Beek. The 24-year-old scored 32 goals and provided 18 assists last season. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
