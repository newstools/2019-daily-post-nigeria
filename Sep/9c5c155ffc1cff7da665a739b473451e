The Governor of Taraba State, Darius Ishaku, has said that Nigeria as a country is not yet mature after 59 years of independence. He stated this while fielding questions from journalists in Jalingo shortly after he arrived the state from Abuja. Ishaku said “We’ve failed to take Nigeria to enviable position.” The Governor called for a drastic change in attitude and approach to governance by politicians. Ishaku said, “Yes, we are 59 years old, but I don’t think we are 59 years mature — it is sweet and ugly. “It is sweet because we have independence, but ugly because we have not been able to utilise the 59 years to take the country to an enviable position. “It’s a shame that Nigeria as a giant of Africa is still lagging behind. “I was in Rwanda and I was amazed at their development in the healthcare sector alone. “Here we are being called the giant of Africa, but are just sitting giant. “A lot still needs to be done. We need to transform our thinking, work hard in education, health and power, among others. “If we can improve on power alone, the multiplier effects will be tremendous,” he said.
