Mrs Janet McDickson, Assistant Director, Information to SSAP-SDGs, disclosed this in a statement issued on Monday in Abuja and made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). The former Lagos State deputy governor resumed duty on Monday. Oorelope-Adefulire, while appreciating members of staff for their support during her first tenure, said that the office couldn’t have recorded successes without their support. She pointed out that more support was needed to enable the office achieve the sustainable development goals and make Nigeria great. The SSAP-SDGs urged Nigerians to imbibe the culture of loving one another, pointing out that love for one another was fading. “We must make the country work for us, our children and grandchildren by bringing out the African value of love for one another and for the society,” she said.
