One of Big Brother Naija, BBNaija ‘Pepper Dem’ housemates, Tacha on Sunday night surprised viewers. This came after one of the eleven housemates, Khafi was evicted from the reality show after scoring least votes. Khafi’s eviction left ten housemates battling for the grand prize worth N60m. Following her eviction, Tacha who does not hug or show affection to fellow housemates, opened her arms to Khafi before she left the house. She also took a paper with Khafi’s name on it and pasted it on her bed as a sign of friendship.  DAILY POsT recalls that Mike had days ago caused reactions on social media after he claimed Tacha has body odour. Mike told Khafi to inform her friend, Tacha, to apply deodorant. He said, “Khafi tell your friend (Tacha) to top up ( apply roll-on),I said something to her but l don’t think she took my word. “If anyone is smelling in the house we should tell her. It shouldn’t be a thing.” However, some evicted housemates have countered his claim, stating that no one had any body odour in the house.
