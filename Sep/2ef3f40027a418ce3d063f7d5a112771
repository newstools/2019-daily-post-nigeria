Apostle Johnson Suleman, General Overseer of the Omega Fire Ministries International has joined Nigerians to condemn the Xenophobic attacks happening in South Africa. Suleman in a post on Tuesday described Xenophobia as evil, adding that Nigeria supported South African when they needed help the most hence should treat Nigerians with love. According to him, the killings makes no sense because, “Mandela stayed in Enugu for a while, Nigerians supported ANC leadership and invested cash into South African government.” The outspoken cleric further called on Nigerians celebrities to speak up and condemn the attacks on social media while they offer prayers to God to intervene in the matter. In a series of post on his Twitter page, Apostle Suleman wrote: “It makes no sense to see fellow Africans killing themselves. Xenophobia is evil. Africans are one big happy family. “It’s wicked to take the life of your fellow African brother or call him a stranger in an African country. Lord put an end to this evil act in Jesus name. “No nation supported south African struggle like Nigeria. Mandela stayed in Enugu for a while, we supported ANC leadership, we invested cash into their government years ago..we don’t deserve this, arrest foreigners who are into crime, not innocent businessmen.it’s totally condemnable. “We can’t keep quiet why hardworking Nigerians in the diaspora are been killed. “Where are those celebrities who are always standing for unconfirmed stories, these are confirmed killings, speak up. “While we pray for God to intervene, all Nigerians at home and abroad, condemn this.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
