Former Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate, Rico Swavey, has reacted to the disqualification of Tacha from the current ‘Pepper Dem’ season of the reality show. Swavey described Tacha’s disqualification as unfair, stressing that fellow housemate, Mercy should have also been disqualified. In a tweet, Swavey wrote: “This is unfair. Both of them should’ve been disqualified!! “Guys, remember this is just a game and Biggie has the final say. Please, enjoy the remaining 10 days of the game. Don’t get it twisted BIGGIE is always right. “It’s like watching the final of the Champions League and Messi or Ronaldo get RED carded. I was enjoying the competition between them. I love them both and It would have been interesting to see the final score between them.”
Big Brother had on Friday disqualified Tacha over act of provocation and violence. Tacha was sent out following her face-off with Mercy which saw both housemates hurl insults at each other. The fight started when Seyi called Mercy to the lounge so they could read Biggie’s scroll. But, Mercy, who had her bath came out late for the reading. This, however, did not go down well with Tacha who rained insults at her. Mercy in return called Tacha a dirty girl with mouth and body odour which got Tacha furious as she dragged Mercy’s hair. Biggie, after playing the clip of the housemates’ fight, said Tacha was found guilty of physical violence.
