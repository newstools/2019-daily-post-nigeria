Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said Jose Mourinho is entitled to his opinion. Mourinho slammed United players, after they lost 2-0 to West Ham on Sunday. The Portuguese, who was sacked last season and replaced by Solskjaer, claims he “doesn’t see any improvement” from the team he managed and says there were no positives for the side to take from Sunday’s defeat. Asked about Mourinho’s remarks, Solskjaer told reporters: “Well, I think he’s got a right to his opinion. “Of course, we lost here last year, it’s always a difficult ground to go to and we hope we should do better than we did. We hope for better. “But the key moments, they grasped and we didn’t, I have to say. Two fantastic finishes from two good left feet and we just didn’t take the chances when we had them.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
