The Bauchi State Police Command on Tuesday, following an intelligence-led operation, destroyed a suspected kidnappers’ hideout in Alkaleri LGA during which two suspects were killed and several dangerous weapons recovered. A press release, which was made available to journalists in Bauchi by the Command PPRO, DSP Kamal Datti Abubakar, revealed that on 24/09/2019 at about 2000hrs, based on credible intelligence, the Command tactical team attached to ‘Operation Puff Adder’ in collaboration with Danga security volunteers trailed some suspected kidnapping/armed robbery suspects to their camp in Gali forest, Alkaleri LGA, Bauchi State. “On sighting the Police team, the suspects engaged them in a gun duel but were successfully overpowered by the superior firepower of the Police and two of the suspects were gunned down while the rest were believed to have escaped with bullets wounds, the release further reviled. “The suspects were then taken to Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Teaching Hospital for treatment but were later certified dead by a Medical Doctor. “Exhibits recovered during the operation include: Two AK-47 rifles, Eleven rounds of live ammunition and Four motorcycles,” the statement added. The PPRO stated that the case was under investigation while no causality was recorded on the side of the Police team or any of the volunteers/members of the public and efforts were on top gear to arrest the fleeing suspects. “Finally, the Command wishes to assure the general public that, it will not rest on its oars in the ongoing operation to rid the State of all forms of crimes and criminality and appeals for more support from the public by providing useful information to the Police and other security agencies on criminals and criminal hideouts in the State,” the release concluded.
