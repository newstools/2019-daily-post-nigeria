The Delta State chapter of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights, CDHR, on Monday said Nigeria is celebrating 59 years of under – development, insecurity as well as violation of court orders. The CDHR added, “We are celebrating 59 years of brutality of Nigerian Police. We are celebrating 59 years of kidnapping. Rampant kidnappings everywhere in our country.” The Delta State CDHR Chairman, Comrade (Dr.) Prince Kehinde-Taiga made the assertion in a chat with DAILY POST in Warri. Taiga said the nation ought to be celebrating freedom of movements, constant power supply and adequate security everywhere. He expressed sadness that Nigerian leaders travel out to develop other countries after looting the treasury. “The Government of today is no respecter of law. They don’t respect court orders. There is no constant power supply. There is no good road. There is no good health care facilities. “Common free education that ought to have been given to our children, primary, secondary is not there. Even University education is not there. We are celebrating 59 years of under-development.” Taiga called on the Nigerian Government to wake up from their slumber, stressing that they should understand there’s rule of law governing the affairs of the nation.
