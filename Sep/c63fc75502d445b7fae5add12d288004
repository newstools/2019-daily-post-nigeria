The House of Representatives has resolved to investigate why the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has not deregistered political parties that are not winning elections in line with the Electoral Act, 2010. The House mandated its committee on electoral matters to investigate the circumstances surrounding the situation. The decision followed a motion moved by Francis Uduyok. Speaking on the motion, Uduyok said that INEC had failed to comply with the provisions of Section 78 sub-section (7) (ii) of the Electoral Act, 2010. He noted that there would not have been rising number of political parties if INEC had done its job. He said, “Section 78 sub-section (7) (ii) of the Electoral Act, 2010 confers on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) powers to de-register Political Parties. “The aforementioned sub-section clearly states that failure of any Political Party to win at least one (1) seat in the National or State Assembly Elections will result in de-registration of the said Political Party.” He, however, raised concerns that “since the commencement of the Act, Section 78 (7) (ii) has not been fully implemented given the rising number of Political Parties in Nigeria with neither a seat in either a State House of Assembly or the National Assembly “If Section 78 (7) (ii) of the Electoral Act is fully implemented, it would regulate the numerous Political Parties, reduce election costs, as well as reduce void votes caused by the inability of citizens to comprehend the long list of Political Parties on ballot papers.” The committee was given 4 weeks to conclude investigation and report back to the House.
