Manchester United goalkeeper, David De Gea, is on the verge of rejecting their contract offer and leaving Old Trafford on a free transfer next summer, according to the UK Sun. De Gea’s current deal expires at the end of the season, but despite holding extensive talks with United, an agreement over a new deal has not yet been reached. The Red Devils have offered the Spaniard a deal worth £350,000 a week, which would make him the highest-paid goalkeeper in the world. But De Gea has told friends he is “willing to snub” the offer. His Spain teammates feel the 28-year-old could stall until January, at which point he would be free to negotiate with teams outside of the Premier League.
