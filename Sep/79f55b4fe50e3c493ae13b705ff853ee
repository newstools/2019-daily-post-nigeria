Former Manchester United defender, Gary Neville, has revealed three players current manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, should bring to the club next year. Neville, interacting with Twitter users in a Q&A on Tuesday morning, listed PSG’s Kylian Mbappe, Real Madrid defender Raphael Varane and Chelsea midfielder N’Golo Kante, as players who will improve the United squad. Varane has long been linked with a move to the Red Devils and is thought to be a firm favourite of executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward. Mbappe has been linked with an exit from PSG, although he is thought to be more likely to head to Real Madrid than the Premier League. Although Kante was rumoured to be close to joining PSG in the summer, it’s highly unlikely Chelsea would sell to a Premier League rival.
