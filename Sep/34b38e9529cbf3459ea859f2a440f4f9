Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, has declared that Nigerian youth are talented and resourceful. Dare, in a keynote address during a side event at the 74th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), said youths in Africa’s biggest nations are in a position to help solve major challenges of the world. The minister told the audience that in the coming years, Nigeria will rely increasingly upon its youth population to develop smart products and solutions to conquer the challenges and problems of climate change, economic slowdown, unemployment and poverty. “The Ministry of Youth and Sports Development believes strongly that by creating digital jobs where opportunities abound, Nigeria’s teeming youth population of over 65 million will have a better chance of employment and entrepreneurship”, he said. The minister urged the youth to take their place in history and not be consigned to the backburner. Dare added: “They must not allow themselves to be silenced by those forces who say the young should be seen and not heard. But this world and its future belongs to them more than to anyone else. “They must continue to raise their voices until the work is done. History will write of this moment that the children came to teach their parents and the older generation. “By so doing, they just might have saved the world and all of us on it. The alternative history is much too dreadful to contemplate let alone to happen. “The youth indeed are rising to the challenge and are challenging all of us to rise with them. We must answer their determined call,” he stated. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
