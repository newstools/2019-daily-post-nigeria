The Federal Government has reaffirmed its decision to end the operation of joint accounts by state and local governments. Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, SGF, made the remark while stating that Federal Government would no longer condone mismanagement of local government funds by states. Mustapha, who was represented by the Director Special Duties in the Office of the SGF, David Attah spoke at the national summit on local government administration in Abuja. He accused state governments of using their control of the joint accounts to starve local government areas of statutory allocations. “After so many ruinous years of our recent past, we certainly cannot live with the continued mismanagement of public funds (joint account) any longer. “Most of us know too well the dangers and consequences of this sustained degradation of our local government system which manifest in increased wave of crimes and social maladies which have dovetailed into various dimensions, agitations, and unrests. “Suffice to say that no ‘baby factory’ or incidence of kidnapping would find space where local government councilors are fully involved in governance and work with landlords associations and town unions. “All of us, directly, or tangentially, are exposed to the impact of local government administration daily,” he said.
