Chelsea striker, Olivier Giroud has insisted that he will not accept limited role under manager, Frank Lampard’s starting XI this season. The 32-year-old also said that he does not want to be number two striker at Chelsea, adding that he still has goals in his head. The Frenchman added that he is resolute to win his place back in Lampard’s starting line-up after dropping behind fellow teammate, Tammy Abraham in the pecking order. The former Arsenal star has started just one of Chelsea’s four Premier League matches so far this term, with Lampard instead putting his faith in Abraham. Asked whether he will be happy to accept a more limited role under Lampard this season, Giroud told Le Figaro: “Obviously not. I have goals in my head. “I’m here to help the next generation, but the time for retirement has not come. “I’m still hungry and have a lot of ambition. I don’t want to be Chelsea’s No.2 striker, for sure. “Just because I’m here as an older brother for the younger players, it doesn’t mean I’m out on the sidelines.” Giroud will hope to feature for Chelsea when they take on Wolves in their next away Premier League fixture on September 14.
