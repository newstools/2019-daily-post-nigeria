Nigerian comedian, AY Makun, on Saturday reacted to the disqualification of Tacha Akide from the Big Brother Naija reality TV show. Recall that Tacha was disqualified from the show for alleged provocation and violence during a fight with fellow housemate Mercy Ekeh. However, AY said the decision to send Tacha packing from the show was uncalled for. Speaking in a live video on Instagram, the popular comedian said: “But that part where they now had to throw her [Tacha] out is the part that I do not support. “Not like I support violence but it was quite subtle. It was just a pull like ‘get your hair off my face’ kind of attitude.” The comedian spoke further that Mercy attempted the real violence when she picked an object to attack Tacha. He said: “Mercy attempted grabbing a bottle or something to use on her before the boys came in.” SEE VIDEO   Here’s what comedian, AY said about #Tacha ‘s disqualification from the #bigbrothernaija reality tv show. #bbnaija #bigbronaija #bbnaija2019 #BNxBBNaija4 #BBNaija4 #Bet9ja #Bet9jaBBN #BigBrotherNaija #BigBrother9ja #BellaNaija #Bet9jaBBNEviction #bbnaijapepperdem #Nigerian #nigeriawedding #nigerians #nigeria #Tacha #mike #jeff #sirdee #seyi #ike #mercy #frodd A post shared by  nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen) on Sep 28, 2019 at 6:04am PDT  Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
