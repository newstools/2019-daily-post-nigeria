A clash between a joint security mobile court and trailer drivers, on Thursday led to the shutdown of the Yola-Mubi road at the Sangere end in Girei Local Government Area of Adamawa State where the Modibbo Adama University of Technology (MAUTECH) is located. The Yola-Mubi road is a major highway linking the state capital, Yola, with the state’s next biggest town and commercial centre, Mubi, as well as other major towns, including Song, Gombi and Hong. Sources said the clash started between the trailer drivers and officials of the mobile court made up of police and VIO personnel as well as officials of the state Board of Internal Revenue over demand for vehicle papers. A police officer among members of the mobile court was alleged to have manhandled the driver of a trailer following an argument when the policeman asked the driver to present his papers at the scene of the operation. The driver was said to have been injured in the process and had to be admitted in an undisclosed hospital. Many other trailer drivers reacted by barricading the road with their vehicles, blocking off other road users coming into Yola or leaving to other parts of the state. They vowed not to leave the scene, saying they had faced similar assaults in recent times and they needed to show that they had endured enough intimation by security personnel. They stood their ground far into Thursday evening when they eventually pulled off and normalcy restored. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Sulaiman Ngurore, who spoke to DAILY POST on the development Thursday night, said it actually took a delegation led by an assistant commissioner of police to get the trailer drivers to back down. He said the Command had mandated the state CID to investigate the conflict and to ensure that whoever was found guilty was punished accordingly.
