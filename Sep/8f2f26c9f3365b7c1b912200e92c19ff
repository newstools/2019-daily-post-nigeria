Dino Melaye, Senator representing Kogi West has dismissed reports suggesting that he is the father of Ex-BBNaija housemate, Tboss’ child. Melaye described the claim in some quarters as ‘lies’, adding that he never dated Tboss. In a tweet on his official Twitter page on Sunday, Melaye wrote: “I naturally should ignore lies making the rounds that I’m the father of Tboss’s child. “Every child is a blessing from heaven to every new mother and I congratulate TBoss on the new bundle of Joy. As for the father, It’s Not Me. I never dated TBOSS. Olodos take note accordingly.” Meanwhile, Tboss had already spoken up on her pregnancy after many months of speculations. The 35-year-old said she had to keep her pregnancy away from social media because she was scared of the negativity of some users. According to her, she did not keep her pregnancy away from social media because she was ashamed, she did it just to protect herself from negativity on social media and keep her sanity. TBoss wrote on Instagram, “What is it about our Generation that’s always so eager to post up our private lives on Social Media? “We get Good news- SM, not so good news- SM, Someone offends us, someone owes us money, breakups, new home, new car, new shoes, fake designer shoes, borrowed stuff- There’s Absolutely No Mystery anymore. You wanna know about a person? Just look up their SM pages & you’d get a pretty close picture of whom you’re dealing with. “I agree I’m not exactly social media compliant but I’m also guilty of sometimes putting more than I ought to have out there thereby subjecting myself to being misinterpreted, misquoted, misunderstood and highly misjudged and that’s why it was extremely difficult for me to keep my pregnancy all to myself.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
