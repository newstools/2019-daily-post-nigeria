BT Sport pundit, Chris Sutton, has backed Manchester City to win a third Premier League title on the spin. Pep Guardiola’s men pipped Liverpool to top spot by just a point last time out. However, Jurgen Klopp’s men have made a storming start to the new season and are the only team to boast a 100% record after four games. But Sutton is sticking by his pre-season predictions. He told the Daily Mail: “I’m still backing City for the title, followed by Liverpool, Tottenham and Arsenal. United haven’t got the players to get there. “I can’t believe they let Alexis Sanchez go. They had already sold Romelu Lukaku and signed no replacement, so they were already light up front. “I fear Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has cut his nose off to spite his face. He’s now relying on Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial, maybe even 17-year-old Mason Greenwood to do a job up front. “As for Chelsea, with their lack of signings and no Eden Hazard, the top four is beyond them.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
