The Zamfara State Government has constituted a 24-man committee to investigate the alleged abuse of the Qur’an in the state. The governor, Hon. Bello Muhammed Matawalle, who spoke through the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Hon. Bala Bello Maru, vowed that anybody or group of people responsible for the evil act must not go unpunished, pointing out that his administration was committed to sanctioning anybody found wanting, regardless of his or her position. The 24-man committee was mandated to investigate the desecration of the Holy Qur’an within the stipulated time given. According to a statement signed by the Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Bala Bello Maru, the inauguration of the committee followed the recent report of desecration of the Qur’an by unknown persons at Shattima Primary School in Gusau the state capital late last week. Members of the committee include Professor Ja’afar Makau Kaura, who serves as chairman with Islamic scholars, the educationists, representatives of security agents, council of chiefs, the NBA, ZAROTA, NUT and the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) as members. “We have placed the sum of two million naira (N2 million) as reward for any person who provides any information leading to the arrest of any person or group of persons involved in the unholy activities and molestation of the holy Qur’an in the state,” the SSG pointed out.
