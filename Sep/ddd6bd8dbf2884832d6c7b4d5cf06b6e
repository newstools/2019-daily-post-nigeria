Immediate past senator that represented Kaduna Central at the 8th Senate, Comrade Shehu Sani, has called on northern governors to learn how to end kidnapping and banditry in the region. Senator Sani gave the advice while receiving Chikun Youth Ambassadors, led by its chairman, Khalifa Usman Shu’aib on a courtesy visit to his house. He noted, “Kidnapping and banditry is prevalent mostly in Zamfara, Katsina and Kaduna States and of recent, governors of Zamfara and Katsina were reported to have entered negotiations with the criminals in effort to forestall peace in their states.” While noting that kidnapping is demonizing the north and western states of the country, the former lawmaker said government at all levels have failed in their responsibility to protect the citizens. Sani explained that now that Nigeria has gone so low to the point that bandits gives conditions, peace with bandits can only be sustained if it is oiled with money. According to him, “Nowadays, the poor and rich, powerful and weak have given up on traveling along the Kaduna -Abuja road and now stampeding train station at Rigasa. “Right now the government is failing to protect its citizens. Our people are being kidnapped everyday and they are selling their lands, farm produce and houses to pay kidnappers. “This is a serious problem for this state, the whole of the Northern and Nigeria. “There can be no meaningful development in the North as long as the trend of kidnapping continues. “The governors of the north, particularly those from the ruling party should come down from their high horse and learn from the Zamfara governor on how to end kidnapping and banditry. They should keep away pride and arrogance and be humbled to learn from this young man in Zamfara state.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
