The House of Assembly Elections Petition Tribunal sitting in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State Capital on Sunday upheld the victory of Nse Ntuen (APC), member representing people of Essien Udim at the State House of Assembly. The presiding Judge, Justice Akanbi also ordered the INEC to issue the APC candidate Certificate of Return, having been declared and returned by the returning officer. Recall that Ntuen led a faction of the Assembly late 2018 as speaker following their sack by the leadership of the Assembly for defecting to APC. He was refused certificate of return by Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) though he was allegedly declared the winner by the Returning Officer after the election. Ntuen, while reacting to the ruling, thanked the leadership of his party for standing by him throughout the legal battle. His words, ”I thank the living God, the APC family, our political leaders and particularly, my mentor and leader, the Hon Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio and wife among numerous others. The judgment is simply the victory of light over darkness.” Meanwhile, other petitions filed by other APC House of Assembly candidates did not succeed as the tribunal confirmed the elections of PDP house members for Abak, Itu and Etim Ekpo state constituencies and made Ntuen the only minority member of the house of Assembly.
