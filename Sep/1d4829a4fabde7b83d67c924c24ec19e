Romelu Lukaku has hailed his relationship with manager, Antonio Conte, after scoring in Inter’s 2-0 derby victory over city rivals AC Milan. Marcelo Brozovic’s deflected effort early in the second half gave Inter the lead, before Lukaku’s header sealed the win with 12 minutes left. Conte’smen have now recorded four consecutive victories in Serie A. For Lukaku, the convincing win was a perfect answer to a poor Champions League draw against Slavia Prague on Tuesday. “My relationship with Conte is very strong. “He is a coach who really helps me. At the age of 26, I want a coach like this, who motivates and helps me every day. “I am very happy to be here and to be working with him. This match is very important for us and we are pleased with the three points. “The game with Slavia Prague was difficult, but we prepared well and gave a strong reply,” Lukaku said to DAZN.
