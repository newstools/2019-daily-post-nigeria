Barcelona president, Josep Maria Bartomeu on Friday claimed that Paris Saint-Germain star, Neymar did everything possible to return to Camp Nou, before the European transfer window closed. He also said that Neymar did not join Barcelona because the Catalan club could not meet Paris Saint-Germain’s demands for the 27-year-old. Paris Saint-Germain has retained the Brazil superstar despite strong speculation he would leave, two years after joining from Barcelona for a world-record €222million fee. Neymar is heavily linked with the Catalans and their LaLiga rivals, Real Madrid, amid rumours that the player offered up to €20m of his own money to facilitate a transfer back to the Spanish champions. There has long been speculation that Neymar regretted his decision to leave Barca in 2017. “Neymar did everything possible because it was what he wanted,” Bartomeu told Barca’s in-house television channel. “I think now he has another strategy, another project and this season, he will play for PSG.” “Barca had already planned their squad, but the opportunity to sign Neymar was one that came up in the market,” he added. “His signing was an extra — it wasn’t planned. “Barca never offered our players. It was PSG who asked for them in the negotiations. “The deal didn’t go through because the club could not meet PSG’s demands.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
