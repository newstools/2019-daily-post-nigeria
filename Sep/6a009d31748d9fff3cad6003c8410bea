Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has reacted to the Presidential Election Tribunal judgment that dismissed the petition of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and its candidate Atiku Abubakar challenging the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari in the 2019 election. DAILY POST reported earlier that the Justice Mohammed Garba,-led Tribunal dismissed Atiku and PDP petition in its entirety. Omokri compared the tribunal judges to the Osama Bin-Laden-terrorists that bombed World Trade Center on same date in 2001. According to him, the judges had succeeded in bombing Nigeria for declaring someone he described as a semi-literate and unqualified, winner. He tweeted, “On 9/11 TERRORISTS brought down the World Trade Centre and killed thousands. On 9/11/19, JUDGES brought down Nigeria’s Education Sector and killed the dreams of many students by declaring that a SEMI-LITERATE is EMINENTLY QUALIFIED for the highest post.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
