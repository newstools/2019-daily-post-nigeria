The South African High Commission in Nigeria has shut down operations. This was reported on Thursday by eNCA, a South African media house. It quoted the Department of International Relations and Cooperation’s Lunga Ngqengelele, as saying the decision was out of concern for the safety of employees of the embassy. “We have been in communication with the Nigerian government and we have been assured of the protection of the businesses belonging to SA. “Nigerian police quelled the uprising from the Nigerians attacking SA business, we understand that arrests were made. We are pleased that there was no loss of life,” he said. There have been reprisal attacks in Nigeria over the xenophobia in South Africa.
