The Kaduna State Police Commissioner, Mr. Ali Aji Janga, has dragged a Kaduna based businessman, Yahaya Maikori, before a Chief Magistrate Court for alleged criminal conspiracy, mischief and theft. Maikori was dragged to court alongside one Suleiman Zubair for alleged theft of customized doors and windows from a property in Barnawa, Kaduna South local government area. DAILY POST gathered that one Alhaji Aminu Aliyu reported the theft of the said items from the property belonging to him to the police, and upon investigation, Maikori and Zubair were arrested and charged to court for alleged theft of the items. Counsel to the complainant, Aminu Aliyu, Barrister Olanike Dare, who was in court for the proceeding for her client, told newsmen that the defendants, Yahaya Maikori and Suleiman Zubair allegedly vandalised the property of the nominal complainant, that is a building in Barnawa and stole some items. She, however, said that the prayer of the nominal complainant was that those responsible for theft of his property be dealt with according to the law. Meanwhile, the case, which was up for hearing before Senior Magistrate Bashir Shittu on Tuesday was adjourned to 18th November, 2019 due to the inability of the Defence Counsel, Shaweloh Maiwada to access a certain document from the prosecution. Dare explained, “The case ought to go on for hearing today, but the defence counsel did not apply appropriately for a document he needs from the prosecution. Because, there was an order of the court initially that, he should be given the document, but he did not apply appropriately.” Speaking to newsmen after the court session, Maiwada said since the court has ruled that the said document has to be paid for, he would pay and get it before the next adjourned date.
