Convener of Concerned Nigerians, Deji Adeyanju, on Thursday dared the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo to resign from office and submit himself to the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission, ICPC. Adeyanju stated this while reacting to Osinbajo’s comment that he would waive his constitutional immunity to allow for probe into the allegation of him misappropriating N90bn. Recall that former Deputy spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Timi Frank had alleged that the Federal Inland Revenue Service, FIRS, had released the N90bn to Osinbajo for the 2019 general elections. The political analyst had alleged that Osinbajo’s ongoing travails was allegedly due to corruption and had nothing to do with 2023 politics. He had claimed that he has reliable information from his sources in the presidency to the effect that Osinbajo’s travail has nothing to do with 2023 but alleged mismanagement of about N90 billion Naira released by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to prosecute the last general elections in favour of the APC. But, FIRS denied the allegation, saying it did not make N90 billion available to the Vice-President for election campaign. It accused Frank of seeking cheap popularity while threatening that it would file a libel suit if he refuses to tender an apology in three major newspapers within the next 24 hours. Reacting to Osinbajo’s remark, Adeyanju in a tweet wrote: “If Osinbajo truly wants to waive his immunity, he should resign and submit himself to ICPC tomorrow morning for investigation. There’s nothing to fear. After investigation, Buhari will re-nominate him to the National Assembly if he is corruption-free.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
