Former Super Eagles Coach, Samson Siasia has cried out that his mother, Madam Beauty Ogere, has not been released by her abductors despite paying N1.5 million ransom fee. DAILY POST reports that the kidnappers whisked away Siasia’s aged mother without her Blood Pressure drugs and mobile phone. The kidnappers also kidnapped two other family members, madam Florence Dounana, 65 years, and her daughter, Selekere Dounana, 17 years. The incident occurred at Ogere’s residence in Odoni community of Sagbama Local Government Council of Bayelsa State in July this year. “The situation is pathetic, nothing has changed o. We paid N1.5 million ransom money to the kidnappers and instead of them to release my mother, they released my Cousin’s mother-in-law (66-years-old Florence Donana) and also captured the person that brought the money to them,” Siasia told Sportinglife. “So as we speak, three people are still in the kidnappers’ custody, I mean my mother, the young girl, and the guy that took the money to them. “I am just tired, frustrated and confused. I don’t know what else to do again,” Siasia lamented. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
