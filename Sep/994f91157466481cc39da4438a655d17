The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Uche Secondus, says that Nigeria is dying under the watch of President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress, APC. The PDP leader urged the judiciary to stand up courageously and “save Nigeria now”. In a statement on Monday to mark Nigeria’s 59 years of independence, Secondus noted that ordinary Nigerians deserve salute for their dexterity in the face of failed leadership as witnessed in the last four and a half years. He recalled that the 58th anniversary was marked with a richly endowed nation like Nigeria being declared the headquarters of the word poor “due to the inept leadership of the APC administration.” Secondus regretted that one year later, the situation has deteriorated from bad to worse with no clear direction where we are headed. “What happened in the country last February at the Presidential election remains a sad reminder of the damage this country has done to our democratic psyche as a nation”, he said. The PDP chairman appealed to the nation’s judiciary to “guide their independence, refuse to be intimidated and save this country from the on-going slide”. He urged Nigerians not to lose hope and assured that the PDP will continue to fight for democracy in our land even in the face of hostility from the dictatorial regime of the APC. Secondus while saluting Nigeria’s fallen heroes warned that “what we do or fail to do to save our beloved country will return to hurt us as we are bound to reap whatever we sow”.
