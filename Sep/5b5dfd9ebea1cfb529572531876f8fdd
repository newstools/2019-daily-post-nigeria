The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has expressed its delight at landing an international friendly with the Brazil national team. The Super Eagles will play the South American on October 13 in Singapore. NFF General Secretary, Dr. Mohammed Sanusi, speaking on the federation’s official website, revealed that talks were on to arrange another friendly with an African country. “We are happy to have sealed this encounter with Brazil, the five-time champions of the world. It is not everyday that you get to Brazil, and I think it is very good for our young team. “The Nigeria Football Federation must also commend Eurodata Sport, our FIFA–licensed Match Agent, for pulling this off. “Having said that, the focus now is on getting an African team for the Super Eagles as a second match for the FIFA window in October, ahead of their 2021 AFCON qualifying matches in November,” Sanusi said. Nigeria have two 2021 AFCON qualifying dates in November. After hosting the Squirrels of Benin Republic on November 14, Gernot Rohr’s men will fly to Maseru for a Day Two encounter with the Crocodiles of Lesotho on November 19.
