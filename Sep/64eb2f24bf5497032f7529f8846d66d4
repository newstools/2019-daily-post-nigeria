Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has said he substituted Dani Ceballos against Watford because he wanted to inject fresh impetus on a “very, very hot” day. The Gunners threw away a two-goal lead at Vicarage Road on Sunday, to draw 2-2. Ceballos successfully completed 42 passes, the most of any Arsenal player at the time, before being replaced by Joe Willock in the 60th minute. Many fans were critical of the decision to take off the Spaniard, but Emery has defended the move. “It was very, very hot. We needed in the second half, some fresh players. “We were struggling second half and I was thinking how we can improve with three players, fresh players, forgive us more energy and give us more capacity to be strong physically, tactically and technically,” Emery told the media after the match.
