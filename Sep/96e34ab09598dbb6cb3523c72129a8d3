The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Tuesday described the 100 days in office of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu as a failure. The party said the state governor’s 100 days’ celebration was a charade because it was marked by “failure and hopelessness.” Spokesman of PDP, Taofiq Gani said this in a statement on Tuesday as he gave 30 per cent score for the Sanwo-Olu’s 100 days. The statement read in part, “The 100 days celebration was only attended by “APC apologists” who did not give a credible assessment of the governor’s performance “Even by the governor’s own presentations, he can at best score 35 per cent mark. Such celebration of failure ought to have been avoided by any sensitive and honorable government. “This is just as the governor again exposed his unpreparedness for the job when he described the Badagry road as being within the Lagos East senatorial district as well as confusing Kogi for Kebbi in the LAKE rice project. “In struggling to mention achievements, the governor claimed the renovation of primary health centres and construction of 14 classrooms. “These are indeed projects funded by NGO & Redeemed Church. The governor who claimed to have installed functional WiFi in Lagos however could not mention those areas but only promised to do so.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
