The PPRO said the duo claimed to have graduated from Imo state University. Speaking to newsmen, Mrs Ramatu Sanda, NYSC Coordinator in the state, said that Chidi and Ahamefula presented forged clearance certificates to serve in the state. Sanda said the scheme’s state office received a tip-off from the office of the NYSC Director-General concerning the two fake corps members and took steps towards tracking them down. She said “They told us that they still had some repeat courses, they believed that they can escape it, they paid some persons to clear them for the service. “So we had to hand them over to the police for further investigation, they are no longer our corps members.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
