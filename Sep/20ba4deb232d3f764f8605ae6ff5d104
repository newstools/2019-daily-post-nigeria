Former Jamaican sprinter and 100-metre world-record holder, Usain Bolt, has backed Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo to win this year’s Ballon d’ Or. Bolt, who quit playing football last year after a six-week spell with Australian side Central Coast Mariners, said he will be voting Ronaldo to win the world individual top prize award this year. Perennial Ballon d’Or nominees, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are up for the accolade, along with Liverpool defender, Virgil van Dijk, who scooped the UEFA Best Player of the Year last month for his performances in the Champions League last season. But Bolt believes the trio are all worthy winners, but admitted he’ll be rooting for the Portuguese international. “These are three wonderful players [Messi, Ronaldo and Van Dijk]. Ronaldo and Messi won the prize [The Ballon d’Or] five times each,” Bolt told FIFA’s official website. “For his part, Van Dijk has just won the UEFA prize and in view of his performances in Liverpool last season, his time may have come. But as a supporter of Manchester United, I would surely vote for Ronaldo!” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
