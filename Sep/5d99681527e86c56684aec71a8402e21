Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, launched a furious tirade at his players after they failed to beat Southampton last weekend, calling their performance “a joke”, according to the UK Sun. Danie James gave United the lead, before Jannik Vestergaard’s second-half header ensured both sides shared the points. Solskjaer was furious with the team’s performance and let his players know it in the dressing room afterwards. The Norwegian was particularly annoyed with the side’s inability to finish their chances and put teams to bed, having also taken the lead against Wolves only to be pegged back in the second period. He reportedly described their mentality as “embarrassing” and accused the players of playing for themselves too much and ignoring the basics. Although he did not single out any players by name, he made it clear that he felt some of the squad were not putting in enough effort and were letting the rest of the side down.
