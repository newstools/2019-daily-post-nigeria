Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has said he expects Tammy Abraham to get an England call up very soon, with the way he is progressing this season. Abraham has netted four goals in his last two Premier League appearances for the Blues. However, he was snubbed by Three Lions’ manager Gareth Southgate, for their upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers against Bulgaria and Kosovo. But Lampard is tipping the 21-year-old for an England recall soon. “I am delighted with Tammy, delighted with his attitude. “He has a great attitude in training and a desire to score. I thought his all-round game as well was good. “We are working with Tammy, all the staff, to help little bits of his game where he can be even better. He is very receptive to that. I thought his performance was class. It is everything you want from him and he is unlucky not to have three, I suppose. “I would have loved it for him [to get called up by England], but he can take a bit of a breather. We can work with him because it is a constant with all the younger players. I think England will come calling,” Lampard told reporters at Stamford Bridge.
