Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has joked he’s looking forward to “loads of travelling” at the end of next month, after they were handed an away tie against Chelsea in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup. The Red Devils avoided an upset on Wednesday night, as they scraped past Rochdale at Old Trafford. Mason Greenwood’s strike was cancelled out by 16-year-old Rochdale full-back Luke Matheson in the 76th minute, but the Red Devils eventually won over their League One opposition in a penalty shootout. Immediately after the match, United learned that they will face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, to add to a busy run of away fixtures at the end of October and beginning of November. Solskjaer told MUTV: “If you want to win it then you have to beat the best. “We played them first game of the season this year, we played them in the FA Cup last year. “It slots nicely into a couple of weeks with loads of travelling! “That’s how it is and we’ve got to make the best out of it. “I’m sure we are because that’s the type of group this is, that’s the type of club we are. “We’re not gonna say, “Ahh!” – we’re going to relish it and look forward to it.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
