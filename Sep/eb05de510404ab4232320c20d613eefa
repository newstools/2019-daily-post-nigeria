The All Progressives Congress, APC, in Rivers State has announced the suspension of its planned Ward, Local Government and State congresses scheduled for Tuesday, September 17 in the state. Chairman of the 5-man Interim Committee of the party in the state, Isaac Ogbogbula told newsmen in Port Harcourt that the National Working Committee of the APC directed that the congress should be put on hold following the matter instituted in court. Ogbogbula said though the APC now has a face in Rivers state, it behooves on the NWC to spearhead reconciliatory moves to mend fences with aggrieved members of the party. “The National Working Committee has said that the congresses be put on hold on the basis that it has been served with an order from the court. “The NWC is handling the issue of reconciliation and we believe that they will achieve results. That is why they have said there is no faction of the party in the state. Apparently, we still have some angry member but all the issues will be resolved. “The most important thing is that the APC is alive in Rivers state and I want to assure our members that when the issues are resolved we will proceed with our congresses,” he said. Some aggrieved members of the APC in Rivers state led by Ibrahim Umar and 22 others approached Justice Letam Nyordee of a State High Court to stop the NWC from conducting congresses in Rivers state. This came days after leader of he aggrieved party members, Senator Magnus Abe held a parallel meeting in Port Harcourt where they agreed to boycott the congresses until their grievances were addressed.
