Juventus legend, Gianluigi Buffon, has said he “thanks life” for not letting him win the Champions League. According to the 41-year-old, his failure to win the competition, has allowed him to continue playing football. The Italian goalkeeper has a lengthy list of both personal and team honours to his name, yet the Champions League trophy remains elusive. The Italian has won nine Serie A titles with Juve, and has clinched the Coppa Italia five times, including once with former club Parma. Buffon also won a Ligue 1 title with Paris Saint-Germain last season in his only campaign outside of Italy, having also helped his country to the 2006 World Cup. “For me it’s a huge stimulus and I have to thank life for not letting me win [the Champions League] yet, otherwise I would ask myself why I still play. “It is great to be still in the running and try again, but there is no agreement on playing at least one game in Europe in the season, we are at Juventus and not in an amateur club, I play when I am called in by the coach,” Buffon said, according to Goal. The Juventus legend has come close on three occasions, losing the 2003 final on penalties to Serie A rivals, AC Milan, before falling to Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid in the 2015 and 2017 finals, respectively.
