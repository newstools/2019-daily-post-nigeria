The Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, has said that he is not going to contest the Anambra governorship election in 2021, contrary to insinuations in some quarters. Ngige who spoke in Obosi, Idemili Local Government Area of the state, Ngige described the story making the rounds that he was going to contest the governorship election as false. He said, “That is not possible again. By 2021, I will be too old for that. So, you can see with me that, that is no longer possible.” The Minister, however, said the All Progressives Congress was in top preparation for the 2021 governorship race. “Nothing will stop us this time from capturing the state in that election. We’re prepared and we’re ready. He said since he left office as the governor of the state in 2006 nothing significant had been added to his achievements in the state. “I just drove round the state, the only good roads you can ply in Anambra State were those built by me. Others they put after my government had collapsed. “It has become clear to our people that they need people like us to be happy once more. “The APC will provide that happiness; we shall provide purposeful and responsive governance to our people once more in 2021.” Asked about his take on zoning of the governorship of the state to Anambra South Senatorial District in 2021, Ngige said it was the most ideal thing to do in the circumstance. “We have no zoning arrangement in APC, but I think the most ideal thing to do is to allow Anambra South Senatorial District to produce the next governor of the state for equity sake. “The APC will work towards getting our governorship candidate from that district in 2021; unless we could not find a formidable candidate from the area.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
