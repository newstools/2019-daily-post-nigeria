Reno Omokri, former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, on Friday revealed that ex-Zimbabwe President, Robert Mugabe gave his country one of the ‘highest Literacy rates on earth’. Omokri said this while reacting to the death of Mugabe. DAILY POST had reported that Mugabe died in the early hours of Friday at the age of 95. Recall that Mugabe, the longest-serving president of Zimbabwe, was forced to resign in 2017, following a protracted intraparty crisis. He was succeeded by his estranged deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa. In a tweet on Twitter, Omokri wrote: “You will hear a lot about Robert Mugabe. But one thing you will probably not hear about him is that he gave Zimbabwe one of the HIGHEST LITERACY RATES on EARTH. “You heard me right. On Earth! I have been to Zimbabwe and there is hardly any ILLITERACY there.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
