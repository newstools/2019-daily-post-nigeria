Greta Thunberg, the 16 years old famous Swedish environmental activist, has accused world leaders of doing little to tackle climate change. Greta, who has been raising global awareness of the risks, gave an emotional speech at the United Nation’s climate action summit in New York on Monday. She said: “You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words and yet I’m one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. “We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you. “For more than 30 years the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you’re doing enough when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight. “You say you hear us and that you understand the urgency but no matter how sad and angry I am, I do not want to believe that because if you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, you would be evil and that I refuse to believe.” In his remarks, António Guterres, Secretary-General of the UN, said: “Like the millions who all over the world are demonstrating today in favour of peace with nature, your presence here today is very important for our work.” More than 700 young people took part in the climate conference.
