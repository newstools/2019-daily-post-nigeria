Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate Frodd on Sunday broke down in tears. This followed Esther’s eviction from BBNaija ‘Pepper Dem edition on Sunday. DAILY POST recalls that the lovebirds; Esther and Frodd had shared kisses days ago. However, it seems Esther’s strategy did not work out as she was evicted during Sunday live eviction show.
