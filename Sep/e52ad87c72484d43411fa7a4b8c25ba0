Big Brother Naija 2019 housemates, on Monday, nominated fellow housemates for possible eviction next week. Biggie had last week changed the nomination process. He said the nomination will not be in groups as housemates will go to the ‘diary room to nominate other housemates’. However, Omashola, who was nominated but had the veto power card, replaced himself with Seyi. The housemates up for possible eviction this week are Tacha, Mike, Seyi, Khafi. Here is how the housemates voted: Seyi – Khafi and Tacha Mercy- Omashola and Khafi Frodd- Mike and Ike Omashola- Mercy and Tacha Tacha- Seyi and Mike Khafi- Seyi and Mercy Mike- Omashola and Tacha Ike – Diane and Khafi Diane- Omashola and Mike Elozonam- Frodd and Tacha Cindy- Diane and Ike Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
