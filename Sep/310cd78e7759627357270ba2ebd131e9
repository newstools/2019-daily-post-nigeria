Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has provided the latest update on midfielder, Mason Mount’s injury ahead of his side’s Premier League clash against Liverpool this weekend. Mount sustained an ankle injury on his right leg during Chelsea’s UEFA Champions League 1-0 defeat to Valencia on Tuesday night at Stamford Bridge. The England international was forced off after just 16 minutes following a strong challenge from former Arsenal star, Francis Coquelin. “He has got an ankle injury which we don’t know how bad it is,” Lampard told reporters after Chelsea’s defeat against Valencia. “We are going to have to assess it in the next 24-48 hours to see the scale of the injury, to see how the injury is. “It’s too soon to say, obviously it was a shame because he was playing so well and started well and we had to make the change early.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
