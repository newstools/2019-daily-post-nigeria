Britain, France and Germany have declared that Iran “bears responsibility” for the attack on a Saudi Arabia oil plant this month.” Dpa reports that the world powers announced their position in a joint statement on Monday. “It is clear to us that Iran bears responsibility for this attack. There is no other plausible explanation. ”We support ongoing investigations to establish further details,” the European nations said. The three European nations stressed their “continued commitment” to the 2015 multi-national nuclear deal with Iran. The U.S. has pulled out of that deal and is imposing tough sanctions on Iran. The statement comes as world leaders are gathering for the UN General Assembly in New York. U.S. President Donald Trump is due to address the assembly on Tuesday, while Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is scheduled for later in the week. Meanwhile, Iran has expressed its readiness for an “all-out war” if the United States or Saudi military strikes against his country. Foreign Minister, Javad Zarif, made the declaration as the US, which has announced highest sanction ever, begins troop deployment to the kingdom. Notin that Iran hoped to avoid conflict and was willing to talk to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Zarif stated that his country would not discuss with the US unless it gets full relief from sanctions under the 2015 deal.
