The Ogun House of Assembly has granted Governor Dapo Abiodun’s request to access N1.5 billion loan under the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Anchor Borrowers’ Programme. This followed the adoption of a motion by Yusuf Sheriff (APC-Ado Ota I) and seconded by Sikiratu Ajibola (APM- Ipokia) at plenary on Friday. Leading the debate on the motion, Olakunle Sobukanla (APC-Ikenne), noted that it was important for the State Government to participate in the CBN programme by accessing the fund. Mr. Sobukanla said that the loan would greatly enhance government’s wealth creation and employment generation efforts for the teeming youths.

Mr. Fasuwa noted that the programme will boost the agricultural sector of the state. Also, Oludaisi Elemide (APC- Odeda), added that the programme would help create employment opportunities for youths and earn the state foreign exchange.
