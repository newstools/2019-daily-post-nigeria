The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has started the processes for placement of candidates into all tiers of tertiary institutions for the 2019/2020 academic session. JAMB’s Head, Media and Information, Dr Fabian Benjamin, made the disclosure in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Lagos. According to Benjamin, the period slated for the admission processes as agreed during a policy meeting with stakeholders on June 11, at Gbongan, Osun, remains sacrosanct. “The board has commenced the processes for admission for the 2019/2020 academic session in earnest. “The first choice admission for public universities commenced from Aug. 21 and will end on Nov. 16. “For private universities, it will be from Aug. 21, 2019, to Feb. 15, 2020. “The second choice admission for public universities will be from Nov. 17 to Dec. 17,” he said. Benjamin told NAN that the projection for 2019 was to ensure that candidates utilised more available spaces unlike in 2018 when there were over 500,000 unutilised available spaces in all the tiers of tertiary institutions. He said that this development was contrary to the general narrative that there were no access to tertiary institutions, with about 60 per cent of available spaces unutilised.
