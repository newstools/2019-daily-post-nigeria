Toluwa Jegede, an estate agent, on Tuesday, appeared before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly stealing N1.25 million from the woman he was managing her house. The 39-year-old is a resident of No.2 Oke Awawu St., Off Ajayi Road, Ogba in Lagos. He is charged with stealing but pleaded not guilty. The Prosecutor, ASP Akeem Raji, told the court that the defendant allegedly stole the sum of N1.25 million from Mrs Abigael Awosikude by failing to remit the house rent he collected from her tenants. “The defendant committed the offence sometime in 2017 at Oko Oba, Abule Egba, a Lagos suburb. “The complainant employed the defendant as her estate agent to manage her house located at No 14 Mosoku St., Oko Oba in Agege. “The defendant collected a total sum of N1.25 million from all the tenants and converted the money into his personal use. “All attempts made to retrieve the money from the defendant were futile. “The alleged offence contravenes Section 287(7) of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State 2015 (Revised). The Chief Magistrate, Mrs A.O.Olayinka granted the defendant N200,000 bail with two sureties in like sum. Olayinka ruled that the surety must be gainfully employed with an evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government and have their addresses verified by the court. She said that the surety must be related to the defendant by blood and reside within the court’s jurisdiction. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that stealing from an employer attracts seven years of jail term for offenders if found guilty. The Magistrate, however, adjourned the case until Sept. 18 for mention. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
