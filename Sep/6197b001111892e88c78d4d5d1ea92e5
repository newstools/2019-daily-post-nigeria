Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has praised the impact of Freddie Ljungberg, who joined the first-team coaching staff this season. The 42-year-old, who spent almost a decade with the Gunners as a player, was promoted to assistant first-team coach over the summer after his impressive work with the Under-23s side. Much of his role focuses on integrating the young players he coached previously into the senior team. “He knows Arsenal perfectly, the young players, he helps us every day in training, the matches and before. “He knows the characteristics of the Premier League. I’m very happy with him. “Each assistant has their work. We are together to speak with the players. We are in the dressing room, we spoke about all the situations individually. We share some moments,” Emery said after Arsenal’s 5-0 win over Nottingham Forest in the Carabao Cup.
