Real Madrid have completed the signing of Alphonse Areola from Paris Saint Germain (PSG) on Monday’s deadline day. Areola, PSG’s first choice keeper for the last two seasons, will now provide competition for former Chelsea keeper, Thibaut Courtois at Real Madrid. Courtois has not been convincing enough for Real Madrid, prompting the move for a second choice goalkeeper. Areola has earned a reputation as one of Ligue 1’s most dependable keepers. Last season he was in regular competition for a starting spot with Gianluigi Buffon, who has since returned to Juventus. Real confirmed Areola’s arrival, with their statement saying, “Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain have reached an agreement for the transfer of player Keylor Navas. The club would like to show their appreciation and love for his behavior and his delivery in the five seasons he has appeared in the Real Madrid shirt.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
