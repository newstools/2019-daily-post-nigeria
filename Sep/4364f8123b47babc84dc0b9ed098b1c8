New Super Eagles invitee, Josh Maja, will be wearing jersey number 10 for Tuesday’s international friendly against Ukraine at the Dnipro Arena, according to Sporting Life. The iconic jersey was worn by John Mikel Obi, who retired from international football after this year’s Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. Maja who plays for French Ligue 1 side, Bordeaux, was a late call up for the friendly following the withdrawal of key players. Alex Iwobi, Ikechukwu Ezenwa, Ola Aina, William Troost-Ekong, and Leon Balogun have retained their shirt numbers ahead of the match. Rohr’s men will be facing a Ukraine side, that has never lost to an Africa side in the last seven years. Kick off is 7.30pm.
