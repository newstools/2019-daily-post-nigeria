The Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) OSUSTECH Chapter, Dr Dipo Akomolafe, confirmed the incident to newsmen on Tuesday in Okitipupa. Akomolafe said that ASUU and the University were sad and in disarray over the development. He said “His decomposing body was found in the bush. This is so sad to ASUU and his family members because the abductors never call anybody either ASUU or his family for ransom.” NAN reports that Late Okedayo until his death was a senior lecturer at the Department of Mathematical Sciences and Acting Dean, School of Post Graduate Studies at OSUSTECH.
