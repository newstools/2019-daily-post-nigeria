Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has been boosted by the return of Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford to his squad, ahead of Monday night’s Premier League clash against Arsenal. Rashford hobbled off eight days ago, as United lost 2-0 at West Ham. Pogba also took a knock to his ankle last Wednesday, in a Carabao Cup fixture against Rochdale. However, both players arrived at The Lowry Hotel along with the rest of the team on Monday afternoon, according to the Manchester Evening News. United have won only two of their six league matches, while Arsenal have won their last three games since they surrendered a 2-0 lead at Watford to draw 2-2. Kick off is 8pm West African time. Confirmed United squad members: David de Gea, Sergio Romero, Lee Grant, Victor Lindelof, Axel Tuanzebe, Harry Maguire, Marcos Rojo, Brandon Williams, Ashley Young, Scott McTominay, Nemanja Matic, Andreas Pereria, Fred, Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata, Daniel James, Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
