Glasgow Rangers’ Joe Aribo has vowed to continue wearing the colours of Nigeria, even though he is still eligible to play for his country of birth, England. Aribo is set to make his international debut against Ukraine on Tuesday evening, but playing in the game at the Dnipro Arena does not cap-tie him to the three-time African champions. In a YouTube video uploaded by the Super Eagles Media team, he said: “I am Joseph Aribo, I am from Ondo State. I play for Glasgow Rangers. “I am really happy to have got this call-up to Nigeria and I just want to make the most of it and play as long as possible and just do what I can for the team and make sure that we continue being the best that we can be.” Aribo, who has hit the back of the net four times in the new season, shares the same agent as Alex Iwobi, Ola Aina and Josh Maja.
