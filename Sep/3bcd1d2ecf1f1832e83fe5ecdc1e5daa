Alex Iwobi has claimed that his Everton team-mates laugh at him over his technique in training. Iwobi has made an impressive start to his career at Goodison Park, after arriving from Arsenal for an initial fee of £28m. The Super Eagles star has already netted two goals in three games for the Toffees, scoring against Lincoln in the Carabao Cup and against Wolves in the Premier League. The 23-year-old’s two goals for his new club have both come with his head, having scored just one in the air over his entire career before moving to Mersyside. Despite his new found skill with his head, Iwobi has revealed that he is getting stick for his technique in training. “I don’t know what’s been happening, they [Everton teammates] laugh at me when I try to head the ball in training. “But the practice has been paying off. I was just trying keep it on target [against Wolves]. I didn’t know I could jump that high,” Iwobi told the official Everton website.
