Former Jamaican sprinter and 100-metre world-record holder, Usain Bolt, has urged Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to build a team around midfielder, Paul Pogba and forward, Marcus Rashford. Bolt, a die-hard Man United fan, believes Pogba and Rashford can lead Solskjaer’s men back to the top of the English Premier League table and qualify the Red Devils for next season’s UEFA Champions League. “Paul Pogba is a world-class player and Marcus Rashford is getting closer and closer to this category,” Bolt told FIFA’s official website ahead of the governing body’s The Best awards, which take place on Monday. “I hope we can build a team around them to get back to the top. “The season has not started very well, but we will find our pace and return to the Champions League next year. Anyway, I remain a fan of Manchester United.” Man United will tackle West Ham United in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon at the London Stadium.
