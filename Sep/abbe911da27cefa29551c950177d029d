Evicted Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate has opened up on the recent revelation by housemate, Mike about Tacha. DAILY POST reported that Mike, on Wednesday, claimed that Tacha has body odour. Mike said this at the dressing room after the Pure Bliss challenge. He told Khafi to inform her friend, Tacha, to apply deodorant. He said, “Khafi, tell your friend (Tacha) to top up ( apply roll-on), I said something to her but l don’t think she took my word. “If anyone is smelling in the house we should tell her. It shouldn’t be a thing.” Omashola, however, added that the odour was strong because she uses garlic to cook. But, speaking in a recent interview on Instagram, Khafi said she did not notice any offensive smell from Tacha, while in the house. According to her, she could not defend Tacha because Mike said it in front of other housemates. She said, ”What happened is that Mike had already spoken to Tacha about the issue but he did not know if Tacha listened to him, so he told me about it. ”I and Tacha already had a conversation about what Mike said but I did not have the capacity to say that to him there, because he said it in front of everyone, and that was where it pained me.’ ”Although, people have their off days, I did not have any issue with Tacha even in the HOH room.” See Video   Well, this is what #Khafi said about #Tacha ‘s alleged body odour. She confirmed that #Mike was actually talking about #Tacha not #Cindy the day he advised that someone should be told to apply deodorant #bbnaija #bigbronaija #bbnaija2019 #BNxBBNaija4 #BBNaija4 #Bet9ja #Bet9jaBBN #BigBrotherNaija #BigBrother9ja #BellaNaija #Bet9jaBBNEviction #bbnaijapepperdem #Nigerian #nigeriawedding #nigerians #nigeria #Tacha #mike #jeff #sirdee #seyi #ike #mercy #frodd A post shared by  nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen) on Sep 19, 2019 at 6:59am PDT  Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
