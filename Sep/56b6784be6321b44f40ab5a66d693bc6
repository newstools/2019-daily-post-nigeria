Manchester United target, Fernando Llorente, signed a two-year deal with Napoli on Monday. Llorente, who has drawn interest from Man United over the past few weeks, joined the Serie A side on a free transfer. The 34-year-old was released by Tottenham Hotspur at the end of last season when his contract expired. He scored 13 goals in 66 appearances for Spurs during his two-year spell at Mauricio Pochettino’s side. “I’m happy to come back but it’s early and I can’t say anything. Let’s wait, so I can tell you more,” Llorente told Sky Sports. “Napoli surprised me, they gave me something important. With Ancelotti, I’ll talk only about things done.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
