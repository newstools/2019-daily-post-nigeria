Former England and Liverpool star, Peter Crouch, has criticised legendary Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger for failing to sign defensive midfielder, Steven Nzonzi during his time at Emirates. He also issued strong warning to Arsenal coach, Unai Emery by saying the Spaniard is “asking for trouble” with his current Gunners tactics. Crouch said this ahead of Arsenal’s Premier League clash against Aston Villa on Sunday at Emirates. “Why aren’t they varying their style? Honestly, it is mind-boggling,” Crouch wrote in his column for MailOnline. “You can play out from the back by clipping high balls to your full-backs – watch Ederson do it for Manchester City. “To keep doing what Emery wants Arsenal to do, with little passes around the penalty area, is just asking for trouble. “They have played six games so far in all competitions and have faced 120 shots – 96 of those have come in the Premier League, the highest total of any club. “I have wanted Arsenal to address the defensive balance of their side for years and never understood why they didn’t buy Steven Nzonzi. “Steven played with me at Stoke and he would have been perfect to provide protection in midfield. “He ended up going to Sevilla for £7 million and it was madness Arsenal, Wenger allowed that to happen. “The best sides spot their deficiencies and address them to progress.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
