Reacting, Kanu queried the governors about their statement on Operation Python Dance 2. The IPOB leader wondered why the south East Governors proscribed IPOB despite not having any knowledge about the Operation Python Dance 2. On his Twitter page, Kanu wrote: “South East Governors, if you knew nothing about Operation Python Dance 2, why did you proscribe IPOB in its wake? “The same northern leaders instigating you to fight peaceful IPOB is busy negotiating with and financing their fellow Fulani bandits. “Who is fooling who?
