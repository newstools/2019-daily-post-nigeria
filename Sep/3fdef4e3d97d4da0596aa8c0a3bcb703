The National/State Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Awka, Anambra State, has confirmed Mrs. Stella Oduah as the validly elected senator representing Anambra North Senatorial District. Oduah had been challenged by Dr. Chinedu Emeka of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) before the tribunal over her victory. He had alleged that Oduah was not qualified to contest the election because she did not possess the required academic qualifications. Emeka added that by the time of the election, Mrs Oduah was still a member of APGA, noting that the election did not comply with the Electoral Act. Delivering judgment on the matter, the chairman of the tribunal, Justice Esther Haruna, said the petitioner failed to prove his allegations.
