The Delta State National Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Asaba, has nullified the election of James Manager, lawmaker representing Delta South Senatorial district. Chairman of the three-man panel, Justice E.I. Ngene, gave the ruling on Saturday. Manager was elected on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP).
His election was opposed at the tribunal by former governor of the state and candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Emmanuel Uduaghan. His lawyer, Thomson Okpoko (SAN), told the tribunal that the February 23 National Assembly elections in the district was marred by massive rigging. He prayed the panel to cancel the election and order a fresh election. In its judgement, tribunal cancelled Manager’s election and ordered for a fresh one within 90 days.
