President Muhammadu Buhari has condoled with the family of former Minister of Finance, Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, over the passing to glory of the patriarch of the family, Obi Chukuka Okonjo, 91. Okonjo was until his death a professor of mathematics, university administrator, international consultant and traditional ruler. His message was contained in a statement on Saturday by Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity. The President commiserated with government and people of Delta State, the academia, the Umu Obi Obahai Royal Family of Ogwashi-Uku, friends and professional colleagues of the scholar “who dedicated his life to teaching, research and service of humanity”. “President Buhari affirms that the traditional ruler contributed immensely to Nigeria’s development with his uncommon wisdom of pursuing knowledge, encouraging his wife and children to follow the same path and sponsoring other people’s children to acquire quality education. “The President believes that the wise and fatherly counsels, intellectual depth, and valuable insights of the scholar will be sorely missed by the family and entire nation, assuring that his place in Nigeria’s history is guaranteed. “President Buhari prays that the Almighty God will grant the soul of the elder statesman rest and comfort his family”, the statement added.
