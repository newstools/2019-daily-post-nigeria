Arsenal midfielder, Matteo Guendouzi, has been called up to replace Paul Pogba in France’s squad, for their Euro 2020 qualifying clashes against Albania and Andorra. Guendouzi has had an impressive start to the season, starting all four of Arsenal’s matches in the Premier League. The 20-year-old produced an outstanding performance in the Gunners’ 2-2 draw with Tottenham on Sunday. The youngster has nine caps for France’s Under-21s, but has never been called up to the senior side. Though Pogba played 90 minutes of Manchester United’s 1-1 draw with Southampton, he has been forced to withdraw from Didier Deschamps’ squad with an ankle injury. Pogba was seen limping after the final whistle at St Mary’s and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will be hoping he returns to full fitness after the international break.
