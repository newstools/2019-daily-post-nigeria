Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, on Tuesday declared that Nigerian government would ‘take up” the issue of attack on Nigerians with South African government. Osinbajo explained that the measure was to ensure that such attack “does not repeat itself.” He said this while addressing journalists in Kano State, as contained in a statement forwarded to DAILY POST by his media aide, Laolu Akande. According to Osinbajo: “Let me say first that these recent attacks are condemnable. It is very sad and very unfortunate that the lives and livelihoods of Nigerians living in South Africa are once again being destroyed with such wantonness and with such carelessness and recklessness. “It is unfortunate because Nigeria and Nigerians invested a great deal in the destruction and the pulling down of apartheid. Besides, these acts of bigotry are entirely contrary to the very ideals that all the great South African leaders including the present President fought for, and for which many gave their lives. “Mr President has already spoken about this and obviously we are very concerned and certainly intend to take this up with the authorities in South Africa in order to ensure that this sort of thing does not repeat itself. This is absolutely unacceptable and unconscionable.” DAILY POST had reported that Buhari sent a special envoy to the South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, following the xenophobic attacks on Nigerians.
