Chelsea star, Tammy Abraham has said that he wants to follow the Blues legend, Didier Drogba’s footsteps. The 21-year-old hopes to become like Drogba, who won the 2012 UEFA Champions League for Chelsea. According to him, the Ivory Coast legend, who scored 164 goals for Chelsea during his time at Stamford Bridge, has been his childhood hero. ”I have so many stories from when I was younger watching him [Drogba], growing up watching such a talented striker,” Abraham told The Mirror UK. “I’ve always wanted to be like him, always hungry to score goals. ”Just looking at him he had that appearance about him. And I’ve always wanted to add that to my game. ”So to follow in his footsteps (as the club’s main striker) is always nice”. Abraham will be hoping to continue his fine goalscoring form for Frank Lampard’s men when they tackle Wolves this Saturday in the Premier League.
