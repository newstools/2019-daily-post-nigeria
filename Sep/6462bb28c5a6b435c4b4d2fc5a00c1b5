Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has said his team will stick to passing out from the back. However, ahead of today’s Premier League game against Aston Villa, Emery said the players will still go long, if situation calls for it. Arsenal’s tactic of building from the back came under fire last weekend, after they were held by Watford after letting a two-goal lead slip. The Gunners bounced back from that disappointing 2-2 draw at Vicarage Road, with a 3-0 win away to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League on Thursday, when their style of play was far less risky. But Emery has told Mail Online, that the philosophy of playing out from defence, will be part of Arsenal’s “identity”. “The last match, Watford, was maybe the worst in our build up. But we are going to try, to work, to improve, to achieve our style. “To build up with the goalkeeper and centre back is going to be our identity but we are going to share sometimes with long balls. “Against Frankfurt we were different and decided more times to do long ball, earn metres on the pitch and after attack the space. We are going to decide what to do on Sunday, depending on Aston Villa,” he said. Asked whether his players have the freedom to make their own decisions on whether to build from the back or go long, Emery said: “We use different ways. “We are working every day on the pitch here in training sessions to improve and achieve our best solution in each moment, using videos also.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
