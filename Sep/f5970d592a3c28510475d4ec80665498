Former Arsenal star, Paul Merson, has urged Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, to take a leaf out of Jose Mourinho’s book. Lampard returned to Stamford Bridge in the summer, after taking Derby County to the Championship play-off final, in his first season in management. Under him, the Blues have endured a mixed start to the new season, winning just one of their first four league matches and sit 11th on the table. “Winning games is a hard thing to do when you’ve lost your best player, and one of the best players in the world in Eden Hazard. “Frank is up against it. I think he’ll get patience, but at the moment, I think you don’t always have to entertain. Do a Mourinho! “You sometimes think in a job: ‘Oh, I have to keep entertaining here, otherwise the fans are going to get the hump!’ “In the end, you don’t need to do that, you need to be clued up, take the three points,” Merson said on Sky Sports.
