Senator Dino Melaye, representing Kogi West on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has appealed the judgment of the Kogi State National and State Houses of Assembly Election Tribunal, which voided his election. DAILY POST recalls that the election of Melaye was nullified by the Kogi State National Assembly/State Assembly Election Petition Tribunal. The tribunal also ordered a fresh election in Kogi West Senatorial District. In the notice of appeal he filed on Monday, Melaye wants the Court of Appeal to set aside the judgment. In the appeal dated September 5, 2019, Melaye raised 23 grounds of appeal, in which he faulted the majority decision of the tribunal, The Nation reports. Melaye is also seeking an order of the Court of Appeal allowing his appeal and an order sustaining his objection to the petition or dismissing the petition and confirming his electoral victory. The appeal, which was filed for Melaye by Rickey Tarfa (SAN) listed Senator Smart Adeyemi, All Progressives Congress (APC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as respondents. Among the grounds of appeal include whether the person sued at the Tribunal being Senator Dino Melaye, is the same as the person who contested the poll and declared winner of the election as contained on Form CF001 – Melaye Daniel Dino. “The provision of the law is that the name as used in Form CF001 is the only valid name that can be used to challenge the election of the Appellant. “The principle of equity accepted and applied by the majority members of the Tribunal cannot override the provisions of the law in respect of the petition. “The judgement of the Tribunal was perverse and against the weight of evidence before it,” he said.
