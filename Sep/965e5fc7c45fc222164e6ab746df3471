Buhari, on Monday, constituted an Economic Advisory Council (EAC), dissolving the previous led by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. Moghalu pointed out that President Buhari heeded his advice and did exactly what he recommended. The Presidency had said that the new team is made up of the following: Prof. Doyin Salami – Chairman; Dr. Mohammed Sagagi – Vice-Chairman; Prof. Ode Ojowu – Member; Dr. Shehu Yahaya – Member; Dr. Iyabo Masha – Member; Prof. Chukwuma Soludo – Member; Mr. Bismark Rewane – Member; Dr. Mohammed Adaya Salisu – Secretary (Senior Special Assistant to the President, Development Policy). Reacting to the development, Moghalu tweeted, “I commend President @MBuhari on his appointment of a new Economic Advisory Council to replace the Economic Management Team. “In my book Build, Innovate and Grow (BIG) where I laid out a vision for Nigeria, this was exactly my recommendation on page 273. Glad it has been heeded.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
