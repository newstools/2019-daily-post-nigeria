Manchester United will try to hire Tottenham Hotspur manager, Mauricio Pochettino, if they sack Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. However, the UK Sun reports it will cost United £32million, to secure the services of the Argentine. Pochettino was one of many managers linked with the Old Trafford post in December, when Jose Mourinho was fired. However, he stayed put and led Spurs to last season’s Champions League final. However, Pochettino has since become frustrated at the start of the new campaign, because of poor form and the uncertain futures of some of his squad members. Solskjaer is also under pressure after a poor start to the season, that has already left United 10 points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool. Poor performances against Rochdale, West Ham and Astana in their last three games have also left fans frustrated, while the club’s failure to sign a replacement for Romelu Lukaku in the summer has left them short of options in attack.
