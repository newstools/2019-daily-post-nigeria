Big Brother, on Friday issued Mercy two strikes for provocation. This is coming after Tacha and Mercy engaged in a dirty argument which had both housemates hurling insults at each other. The fight started when Seyi called Mercy to come to the lounge so they could read Biggie’s scroll. But Mercy who had her bath came out late for the reading. This, however, did not go down well with Tacha who rained insults at her. Mercy in return called Tacha a dirty girl with mouth and body odour which got Tacha furious and she dragged Mercy’s hair. Biggie in a surprise twist announced on Friday night that Mercy and Tacha have been found guilty of violence and provocation. He disqualified Tacha from the reality show and issued Mercy two strikes. He said, “Mercy you have been found guilty of provocation and thereby issued two strikes.”   Well, this is what #Biggie did to #Mercy for provoking #Tacha . Two strikes of #Mercy and it is fair enough. .#bbnaija #bigbronaija #bbnaija2019 #BNxBBNaija4 #BBNaija4 #Bet9ja #Bet9jaBBN #BigBrotherNaija #BigBrother9ja #BellaNaija #Bet9jaBBNEviction #bbnaijapepperdem #Nigerian #nigeriawedding #nigerians #nigeria #Tacha #mike #jeff #sirdee #seyi #ike #mercy #frodd A post shared by  nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen) on Sep 27, 2019 at 12:23pm PDT  Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
