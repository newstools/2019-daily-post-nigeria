The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, Pastor Enoch Adejare Adeboye, on Wednesday appealed for an end to violence in Nigeria and South Africa. Many Nigerians have in recent months come under attack in South Africa. The latest onslaught has snowballed into large scale violence which has led to reprisals in Nigeria, Tanzania and other countries. Adeboye via his personal Twitter account urged all parties to embrace peace. He tweeted: “Please shun violence, its dividends lasts a lifetime. Let us all embrace peace and remember that regardless of our race, color or language, we are all of God. #saynotoxenophobia” Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has announced that Air Peace Airline would commence the evacuation of Nigerians in South Africa from Sept. 6, following recent attacks on Nigerians in that country.
