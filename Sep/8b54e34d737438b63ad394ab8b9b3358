President Muhammadu Buhari, on Friday in New York spoke on severe climate challenges confronting the country. He spoke at a meeting with the Nigerian Youth Climate Group at the conclusion of his engagements on the sidelines of the 74th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. The President said: “Nigeria is a neighbour to the Sahara Desert; Lake Chad is shrinking while population is exploding. It’s a challenging situation. With less land, less rainfall, these are very unique problems for the country.” Buhari lauded the youths for representing Nigeria at UNGA as Climate Change Champions, adding, “It is good you are participating so that you can appreciate the problems older people are having.” Esther Agbarakwe, one of the leaders of the youth group, said: “This is the first time we are seeing a President sit with us. It gives us hope. “We young people understand the problems, and are in the vanguard of advocacy. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Climate Change Department works with us for solutions.” She also commended the support the group is receiving from the UN Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed and the Ministry of Environment. Hamzat Lawal, also of the group, thanked President Buhari for signing the Not Too Young to Run Bill into law. “We seek solutions to problems in the Sahel region. If we provide solutions to the Sahel, the world will be at peace”, he said. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
