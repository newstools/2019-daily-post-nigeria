An Ebute Meta Chief Magistrates’ Court, on Thursday, ordered that a father, Michael Abraham, alongside his friend, Sylvester Dike, be remanded in a correctional facility for allegedly defiling his 12-year-old daughter. The police charged Abraham, father to the minor and Dike, 35, with three counts of conspiracy, unlawful sexual assault and defilement. Both defendants, however, pleaded not guilty. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Adeola Adedayo, remanded the defendants at the Nigerian Correctional Service in Ikoyi, pending when the matter would be filed at the Sexual and Special Offences Court, Ikeja. She adjourned the case until Oct. 9, for mention. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Insp. Chinalu Uwadione, told the court that the defendants committed the offence between December 2018 and Sept. 9, at No. 13, Godmon St., Okota. He alleged that Abraham defiled his daughter and also invited his friend Dike to take part in the incestous act.
