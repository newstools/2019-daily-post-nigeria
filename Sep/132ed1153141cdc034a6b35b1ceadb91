The Apex court dismissed an appeal filed by Akinwumi and subsequently upheld the judgement of the Court of Appeal sitting in Akure that set aside the election of the APC lawmaker. The Supreme Court unanimously validated the Certificate of Return earlier issued to James Ololade-Gbegudu by INEC as the lawmaker representing the constituency, for being the authentic winner of the APC primary. The Supreme Court panel presided over by Justice Mary Peter-Odili unanimously validated the issuance of the Certificate of return to Hon James Ololade-Gbegudu by INEC as the authentic lawmaker representing the constituency, for winning the APC primary. DAILY POST had reported how Ololade-Gbegudu had approached the court through his counsel, Mr Femi Emodamori, to seek an order to compel the party and INEC to recognize him as the authentic APC candidate for the constituency and not the Sina Akinwunmi, having won the party’s primary conducted on October 5, 2018. The Apex Court ordered the Speaker of the Assembly and the Clerk to immediately swear-in Gbegudu as the new lawmaker for the constituency. The Ondo State High Court had on May 15, 2019 declared Gbegudu as the winner of the party’s primary conducted on October 5, 2018.
