Former England and Newcastle striker, Alan Shearer, has hailed Alex Iwobi for scoring on his full Premier League debut for Everton. Three goals were scored in the opening 12 minutes of the game at Goodison Park. Iwobi restored Everton’s lead, after Romain Saiss had cancelled out Richarlison’s opener, scoring through a header after a brilliant cross from Sigurdsson. In his half-time analysis, Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer said: “Fantastic ball in, he puts it in with perfection right in the right area. “It doesn’t really have to move for Iwobi that is running onto it there, perfection that ball. “It’s a very, very good header as well. We all know about Iwobi before the game, he has to start and score more goals, he was in the right position there.” Iwobi was replaced by Bernard in the 76th minute.
