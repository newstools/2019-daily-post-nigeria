Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has said that his former team-mate Mohamed Salah has proven himself to be a ‘superstar’, after overcoming a spell at Stamford Bridge, in which some labelled him a failure. The Blues allowed Salah to join Roma on an initial loan in 2015, having only given him a fringe role before that under then-manager Jose Mourinho. The Egyptian’s form in Serie A quickly earned him a €42million move to Liverpool to work under Jurgen Klopp. The Egyptian scored 32 league goals in 2017/2018, breaking the Premier League record for goals in a 38-game season. Ahead of Chelsea’s match against Liverpool on Sunday, Lampard said: “It is hard because everyone has their own pathways. “Unfortunately for Mo, it didn’t work out here but it is great credit to him. He went to Italy and then came back and now he is a superstar. “As for his path, it is hard to compare to what may have been. I had an overlap with him. The talent was obviously there. At the time, I think we had a lot of options in attacking areas. Number 10s, wingers and he didn’t get as many opportunities for whatever reason but yes you could see the talent was there. “But the player that he is now or that came back to Liverpool I think you have to say huge credit is due. You don’t have to search for anything more than look at Mo himself. You have to say what professionalism and work ethic to leave a club like Chelsea is not easy. “People then cast you aside and say you won’t make it there. He went onto be the superstar he is now. It is completely credit to Mo himself.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
