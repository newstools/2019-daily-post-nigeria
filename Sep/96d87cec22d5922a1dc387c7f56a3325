Ukraine forward, Andriy Yarmolenko, has sent a strong message to the Super Eagles of Nigeria ahead of both side’s international friendly match at the Dnipro Arena tonight. The West Ham star insisted that there are no friendly matches involving national teams, adding that he wants Andriy Shevchenko’s side to beat Gernot Rohr’s men. Yarmolenko, who does not consider today’s game as a friendly match, said he wants to make the fans happy by beating the 2019 African Cup of Nations, AFCON, bronze winners in Ukraine. ”I want to win against Nigeria, of course. It seems to me that if you come to a national team, then there is no division of matches into official and friendly,” Yarmolenko was quoted by UA Football as saying. ”So, if this, for example, is a game between the national team and the youth, then we can talk about friendly status but international meetings at the level of national teams, in my opinion, cannot be considered friendly. ”When the full stadium arrives, when the fans create a special atmosphere and drive you forward, you always want to win.” The kick-off time for the match is 7:30 pm.
