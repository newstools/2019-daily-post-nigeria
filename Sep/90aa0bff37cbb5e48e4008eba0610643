Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate Tacha on Sunday attacked fellow housemate, Seyi. Tacha and Seyi have been at loggerheads in the house. DAILY POST recalls that Tacha had shouted at Seyi for calling her out, warning him not to try such again. When asked about her fight with Seyi on Sunday during the live eviction show, Tacha told Ebuka that Seyi is just older than her but does not have sense and act his age. According to her, she has achieved more than him at the age of 23. “Seyi is old but does not have sense and act his age. “If it wasn’t for Big Brother, he wouldn’t have achieved anything. “What I have achieved at 23 , Seyi has not achieved at his age,” Tacha boasted.   #Tacha has just killed and buried #Sheyi … he couldn’t even believe. When two proud people meet. Tacha said that Sheyi will never match her life achievements .#bbnaija #bigbronaija #bbnaija2019#BBNaija4 #Bet9ja #BigBrotherNaija#BellaNaija #bbnaijapepperdem#Nigerian #nigeriaweddin #nigerians#nigeria #egypt #namibia #southafrica A post shared by  nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen) on Sep 8, 2019 at 11:55am PDT  Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
