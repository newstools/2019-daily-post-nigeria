The immediate past Deputy Speaker of Abia State House of Assembly and a Commissioner-nominee, Rt. Hon. Cosmos Ndukwe has condemned the incessant xenophobic attacks on Nigerians and other African nationals in South Africa. Ndukwe, in a statement made available to reporters in Aba on Friday, called for an end to the killing of Nigeria citizens residing in South Africa, which according to him, was not healthy to the existing relationship with both countries, and as well as in the area of economic investments. The statement read, “I could not control the tears running down my cheeks. First, I saw the South African woman married to one of the Nigerians who had to leave for fear of being killed. I saw the sincerity of her expression undercover, that Nigerian husbands are better family men than others. I saw as she submitted to fate in what has become a scenario of dog eating dog. “I watched as the Nigerians forced to leave South Africa sang the National Anthem in a manner that evoked strong feelings. Many other thoughts ran riots in my mind. In all of these, I saw the opposite of humanity (Xenophobia) and genuine humanity being demonstrated by our brother Onyema. He was moved by humanity. He was moved by the need for us to live for each other. He was moved to save Nigerians in South Africa from being annihilated from the entire surface of the earth. “I remember my bible verses on obedience and sacrifice. For those who still think the story of xenophobic attacks in South Africa is a ruse, let them listen to the lamentations of the South African woman whose Nigerian husband escaped being killed after several attempts”.
