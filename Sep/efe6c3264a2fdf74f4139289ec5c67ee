Portugal captain, Cristiano Ronaldo, took his international tally to 93 goals, after he scored four times to give the European champions a 5-1 win away to Lithuania, in their Euro 2020 qualifier on Tuesday. Playing in his 161st international fixture, the 34-year-old notched his eighth hat-trick for his country and the 54th of his remarkable career. William Carvalho completed the rout in stoppage time, as Portugal stayed second in Group B with eight points, five behind leaders Ukraine with one game in hand. “I scored one goal against Serbia and four today and what I want most is to continue like this. “I am happy and enjoying this moment, not just because I scored the goals, but because of the level that we have achieved in these last years. It suits me to continue helping the national team,” Ronaldo said after the game.
