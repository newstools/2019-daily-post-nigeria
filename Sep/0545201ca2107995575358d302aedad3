Organizers of Big Brother Naija, BBNaija have announced a surprise eviction on Friday morning The organizers announced this on their official Twitter page. The post read: “Surprise Eviction on BBNaija today.” This may be connected to the recent argument between two female BBNaija housemates; Tacha and Mercy DAILY POST recalls that Tacha and Mercy on Friday morning engaged in a dirty argument which had both housemates hurling insults at each other. The fight started when Seyi called Mercy to come to the lounge so they could read Biggie’s scroll. But Mercy who had her bath came out late for the reading. This, however, did not go down well with Tacha who rained insults at her. Mercy in return called Tacha a dirty girl with mouth and body odour which had Tacha furious dragging Mercy’s hair.   #Tacha and #Mercy fight dirty. I’m waiting to see how #Biggie will handle this. #Mercy said #Tacha should work on her body odour …. #bbnaija #bigbronaija #bbnaija2019 #BNxBBNaija4 #BBNaija4 #Bet9ja #Bet9jaBBN #BigBrotherNaija #BigBrother9ja #BellaNaija #Bet9jaBBNEviction #bbnaijapepperdem #Nigerian #nigeriawedding #nigerians #nigeria #Tacha #mike #jeff #sirdee #seyi #ike #mercy #frodd A post shared by  nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen) on Sep 27, 2019 at 1:23am PDT  Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
