Telecommunication giant, MTN, on Wednesday withdrew the services of its staff in Abeokuta after information reached the management that MTN offices in nearby Lagos were being set on fire by angry Nigerians who were protesting the killing of Nigerians in South Africa. The affected staff are MTN agents working on part-time basis in its outlets across the Ogun State capital. One of the agents, who spoke with DAILY POST, said their contract with the telecommunication company has not ended, adding that they have not been paid their wages. “Our contract with them has not ended. We started in August. They have not even paid us. They said they will get back to us. They told us to close down when they got information that MTN offices in Lagos were being burnt. They said we should not worry that our money is safe,” he spoke anonymously. Our correspondent, who went round Abeokuta reports that all businesses owned by South Africans like MTN, DSTV, GOTV, Stanbic Bank have been shut down for fear of attacks from Nigerian students.
