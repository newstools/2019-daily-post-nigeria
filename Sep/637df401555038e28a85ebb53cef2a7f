Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has played down concerns about John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi, following their shock 3-2 loss to Norwich on Saturday. The defensive pairing endured a nightmare game at Carrow Road, with both players at fault for Norwich goals. Stones’ blind attempt to play offside led to the second goal, while Otamendi had his pocket picked in the box in the second half for the Canaries’ third. Speaking to reporters after the match, Guardiola said: “They (Stones and Otamendi) play together a lot – they are the central defenders that we have. It happens. “It was a good game. They arrived three or four times [in front of our goal]. “At the same time I know what we can do. I love my players and it’s an honour to be with them. “The people cannot expect us to win or pick up 100 points all the time. We’re going to recover now and come back. “Normally I count how many chances they create. I don’t have that feeling that they had many chances to score a goal, which sometimes happens.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
