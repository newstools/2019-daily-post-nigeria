Paris Saint-Germain’s Ander Herrera has backed his team-mate, Neymar, to win the Ballon d’Or one day. Neymar scored his second late winner in as many games this campaign, leading PSG to a 1-0 victory over Lyon in Ligue 1 on Sunday. The forward was heavily linked with a return to Barcelona during the transfer window, but ended up staying in Paris and has starred on his return. Herrera, who arrived at PSG in July, believes the Brazil international is a future Ballon d’Or winner. “I’m delighted to play with Neymar. I will not talk about his transfer window. “Now, Neymar is with us. He is a fantastic player who can be Ballon d’Or, this season, in a year, in two years. “We are very happy. I hope he can play like that all season,” he told L’Equipe. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
