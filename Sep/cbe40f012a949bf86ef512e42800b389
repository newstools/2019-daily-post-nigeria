Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has insisted he wants to remain with the club for a long time. Messi’s future at the Camp Nou became a topic of speculation after it emerged he has a clause in his contract, which allows him to leave at the end of each season if he so wishes. The Argentina superstar would just have to communicate his desire to move on before the end of May. But Messi told Sport: “Barcelona is my home and I don’t want to leave, but I want to win. “I want to win the Champions League, it’s been a long time since we won it. Barcelona president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, is already working on Messi’s next new deal, which could be his last with the club. The 33-year-old is yet to play this season due to a calf injury.
