Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, has been accused of caring more about “promoting himself”, than focusing on scoring penalties by Premier League legend Matt Le Tissier. Pogba missed from the spot as the Red Devils were held to a 1-1 draw at Wolves last month, a week after Marcus Rashford scored a penalty in the 4-0 win over Chelsea. “Paul Pogba’s penalty record is far worse than that of Marcus Rashford. “I was never overly keen on Pogba’s run-up because it used to take so long, it became a bit of theatre and he wasn’t taking it seriously. “It was all about trying to promote himself as being the big showman and the big ‘Here I am’ without concentrating on the job in hand. “The way Rashford takes penalties is actually far better and if I was the manager he would be the designated penalty-taker,” Le Tissier told the Daily Mirror. Le Tissier has also criticised Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for the shootout shenanigans that have played out at Old Trafford this season. “It does cause confusion if you have two nominated penalty-takers and you just go, ‘Well, let’s see who fancies it on the day’. “That’s not professional, it’s amateurish, schoolboy stuff and that comes down to the manager. “In that situation, the manager needs to be stronger and just go, ‘Right, you’re the best at penalties, you’re my penalty-taker, if you’re not on the pitch then he can take them, but up until that point, you take them’,” he added.
