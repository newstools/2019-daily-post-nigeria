Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has insisted that he has not spoken to striker, Tammy Abraham about pledging his international future to Nigeria over England. Lampard said this following Chelsea’s Premier League 5-2 victory over Wolves on Saturday. Asked by reporters if Abraham is going to Nigeria, Lampard was quoted by Allnigeriasoccer saying: ”I haven’t spoken to him about that”. He added: ”The way that he is going, he is going to be in that bracket. To score seven goals in three games. Fantastic from him. He has to be hungry. He needs to keep playing at that level.” DAILY POST reports that Nigeria’s FA president, Amaju Pinnick had earlier told Abraham to choose the Super Eagles because he has better chances of playing regularly for the team. Abraham’s international future remains a subject of discussion among pundits and coaches due to his eligibility to represent either Nigeria or England. Abraham has featured in two friendly matches for England against Germany and Brazil in 2017 but he is still eligible to represent the Super Eagles of Nigeria in the future Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
