Former Liverpool midfielder, Graeme Souness, has backed Jurgen Klopp’s side to win this season’s Premier League title ahead of Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City. Souness believes the UEFA Champions League winners are now favourite to win the English top-flight league title ahead of Man City after the Citizen were defeated 3-2 by Norwich City over the weekend. Asked whether Liverpool are now favourites to win the Premier League, Souness told Sky Sports: “Yeah, I think so. “With Aymeric Laporte’s injury I thought Manchester City would find it difficult to play against the better teams. Against the likes of Liverpool and the Champions League teams. “It’s not a big advantage for Liverpool – we’re still in September. But first blood is certainly to Liverpool. “They have the momentum, nobody is asking any questions about them. All eyes are on City right now. “I’ve been very impressed by them this season,” he added. “They are a team that no one likes playing against because they’re aggressive and test every part of your game. “They play as a team and have players who will call out their teammates. That makes them very strong. You know you need to be at your very best against Liverpool.” Liverpool are currently on top of the Premier League table with 15 points from five matches, while Man City are second place with 10 points from the same number of games.
