Co-convener of Our Mumu Don Do Movement, Charlyboy, has attacked those saying that Igbo people are spoiling Nigeria’s image following the attack on former Deputy Senate President, Dr. Ike Ekweremadu by members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, in Nuremberg, Germany. Charlyboy, a veteran Nigerian musician, pointed out that the country’s image has been in ruin since the time of Mongo Park, adding that government officials at different levels in the country are thieves. Speaking in pidgin English in a video he shared on social media, the social engineer wondered why Nigerians should be attacking the Igbos while people like Wadume, the Taraba-based kidnap kingpin contested election on the platform of the ruling party and Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje ‘used dollars to sew agbada dress.’ He also noted that Nigerian leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, was yet to produce his WAEC certificate l, yet people are talking of image.
