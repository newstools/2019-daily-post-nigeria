Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate, Mercy on Sunday broke down in tears. Mercy was seen crying bitterly after Ike was evicted from the Big Brother Naija house. Ike is the second housemate to be evicted this Sunday following Elozonam’s exit. His eviction leaves seven housemates to battle for BBNaija grand prize of N60m. DAILY POST recalls that the love birds have been caught severally kissing in the BBNaija house. They have, however, not been caught having sex even as they professed love to each other.   You can see how #Mercy is reacting to #Ike ‘s eviction from the bigbrothernaija reality tv show #bbnaija #bigbronaija #bbnaija2019 #BNxBBNaija4 #BBNaija4 #Bet9ja #Bet9jaBBN #BigBrotherNaija #BigBrother9ja #BellaNaija #Bet9jaBBNEviction #bbnaijapepperdem #Nigerian #nigeriawedding #nigerians #nigeria #Tacha #mike #jeff #sirdee #seyi #ike #mercy #frodd A post shared by  nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen) on Sep 29, 2019 at 12:31pm PDT  Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
