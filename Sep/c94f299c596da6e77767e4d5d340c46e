Chelsea winger, Willian has sent a clear message to the club over his future at Stamford Bridge. The Brazilian international, who has less than a year on his current contract at Chelsea, wants to extend his stay at the club. The 30-year-old also backed the Blues manager, Frank Lampard to become one of the best coaches in the world. According to him, he wants to win the Champions League, play more games and score more goals under Lampard at Chelsea. “From my side, I want to stay,” Willian told the Evening Standard ahead of Chelsea’s Champions League group-stage clash against Valencia on Tuesday night. “I have one year left and I want to stay because I like to play for Chelsea. “I love this club, I love to live in London and my family loves it here. I have been here six years already so everything is perfect for me. “Of course [there is more I want to do at Chelsea], win the Champions League! I want to win more titles here, I want to play more games, to score more goals so everything that I can do, I will try hard to do.” “I enjoy a lot to work with Lampard,” he added. He was a fantastic player, one of the best in the world, and now I hope he can become one of the best managers in the world so I think he has everything to achieve this. “Is it a change of culture? I hope so, because I am here six years, I have had already five managers. I hope he can stay here a long, long time.” Willian has so far spent six years at Chelsea. He has won two Premier Leagues titles, FA Cup, EFL Cup and Europa League. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
