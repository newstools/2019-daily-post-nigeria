Aggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress, APC, have again obtained a court order restraining the National Working Committee of the party from conducting congresses in Rivers State. Ibrahim Umar and 22 others of the Senator Magnus Abe group of the APC approached the court to stop the proposed congresses from holding. The National Working Committee of the APC had last week inaugurated a 5-man Caretaker Committee led by Isaac Ogbogbula empowering them to conduct congresses in the state. But the congresses scheduled for September 17th is now botched following the order by Justice Letam Nyordee of the State High Court in Port Harcourt, in a suit filed by, Henry Bello, counsel to Ibrahim Umar.  “An order is hereby made that all parties in the matter should maintain status quo in relation to the subject matter of the proceedings in this suit pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice,” the order read. The matter was adjourned to September 17 for hearing. DAILY POST reports that this is a renewal of the crisis that denied the APC the opportunity of fielding candidates in the 2019 General Elections, which was evoked by the same Ibrahim Umar and 22 others.
