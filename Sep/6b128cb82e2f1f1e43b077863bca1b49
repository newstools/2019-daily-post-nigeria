Jenni Hermoso grabbed a late hat-trick, as Barcelona hammered CD Tacon 9-1 on the opening day of Spain’s Women’s Primera Division on Saturday, giving the team absorbed by Real Madrid a rude awakening to life in the top flight. Madrid agreed a deal earlier this year to buy capital club Tacon, although they will not officially become part of Real until July 2020. However, the game was still billed by many, as the first women’s Clasico between Spain’s biggest sides. Spain forward, Alexia Putellas. opened the scoring in the eighth minute, before strikes from Aitana Bonmati, Mariona Caldentey and an own goal from Lucia Suarez gave the Catalans a 4-0 lead at halftime. Jessica Martinez scored Tacon’s first goal in the top flight early in the second half, but Bonmati soon struck again and Barca were ruthless in the final stages of the game. Norway international Caroline Graham Hansen scored her first goal for the team later in the second half before Hermoso, who returned to Barca from champions Atletico Madrid this summer, struck three times inside the final 20 minutes.
