President Muhammadu Buhari has postponed the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting which was to hold Wednesday, September 4, 2019. This was contained in a statement Tuesday night by presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu. “This is due to the fact that all the memos earlier submitted to the Council for consideration have been returned to the various Ministries”, it read. “This action will allow Ministers who were recently sworn in have their inputs in the memos sent by their predecessors in office. “Similarly, the period is to enable the Ministers, who are still taking briefs from bureaucrats in the Ministries and familiarizing themselves with their work space, have more time to contribute to discussions at the meeting. “They will also utilize the period of the break to work towards the early preparation and submission of the 2020 budget estimates”.
