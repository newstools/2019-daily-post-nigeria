The Emir of Kano, Mallam Muhammadu Sanusi ii, has cleared the air that he was in South Africa a day before the violence broke out that resulted in diplomatic row between Nigeria and the country. The Emir said in an exclusive interview with the DAILY POST on phone that, ” I actually arrived SA on Tuesday morning and attended the World Economics Forum on Wednesday, not knowing what was happening. He said, ” I went there on two categories: one on an invitation by a friend and second on my personal capacity to deliver a paper at the forum, both my self and those who invited us we all boycotted the conference immediately we heard of the diplomatic row.” Emir Sanusi added that, “Since when we heard of the violence against Nigerians, we never went back to the forum and in fact I’m coming back home tomorrow.” Already, President Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo agreed not to visit South Africa under the climate of xenophobic attacks.
