The Pharmacists Council of Nigeria (PCN) said it has shut down 332 patent stores operating below standard across the State. Director, Inspection and Monitoring of the council, Mrs. Anthonia Aruwa made the disclosure at a press conference held on Friday at the Federal University, Dutse guest house. Mrs. Anthonia Aruwa said the council had earlier undertaken the enforcement activities across the state and 462 premises were visited comprising 450 patent medicine stores and 12 pharmacies. She explained that out of the number of stores visited, only 3 premises were issued compliance directives for various offences ranging from poor handling of controlled drugs, sale and dispensing of ethical/prescription drugs without the supervision of a Pharmacist. “some patent store handlers could not even read nor write in English language, a situation that portends great danger to any patient that visited the shops for drugs” Aruwa stated. She also stated that amongst the closed stores were those that were operating far beyond the scope approved for them by selling highly ethical products with no capacity to handle such medicines. She warned the general public to be cautious about patronizing quack patents stores. “Always ask for the registration status of facilities where you access your medicines by requesting for the current licences issued by the pharmacists council of Nigeria in order to avoid falling into the hands of quacks”, she warned.
