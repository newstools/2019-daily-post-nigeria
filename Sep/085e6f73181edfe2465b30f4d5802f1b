Ex-Nigeria international, Segun Odegbami, has said he believes his former team-mate, Rashidi Yekini, may have been murdered in 2012. Before to his death, Yekini was reported to have been ill for a long time, after allegedly suffering from bipolar disorder, depression and some other undisclosed psychiatric condition. But Odegbami in an interview with The Chat disagreed with the claims, saying “nobody could explain the circumstances of his death”. He said: “His people actually went and abducted him from his car and took him to a native doctor of some sort to cure him of his ‘insanity’. “Why insanity?…because he was funding so many philanthropic projects, giving people his money which he had kept in the bank for so long. “All through his professional career, he didn’t spend a dime of the money he was getting from Europe, so he had a lot of money in UBA at the time, because one of the managers was my friend. “They had even advised him to invest but with his own native intelligence, he did not do much investment. “He built his house, did some things but he had a lot of money so he felt like distributing and they said he was mad so they took him to the native doctor and started giving him all kinds of concoctions and the man passed on. So, that’s why I said he could have been murdered.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
