Atiku Abubakar, 2019 presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has reacted to the death of Prof. Chukuka Okonjo, father of Nigeria’s former Minister of Finance, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. The death of Okonjo, 91, was announced in a statement released by Okonjo-Iweala’s spokesperson, Paul Nwabuikwu. He died in Lagos after arriving from a trip to the United States of America. The statement signed Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala, who served in the former Jonathan government, read: “On behalf of my siblings and relatives of the Umu Obi Obahai Royal Family of Ogwashi-Uku, I announce the passing of my father, Obi Professor Chukuka Okonjo, the immediate past Obi of Ogwashi-Uku, Delta State at the age of 91. “He died in Lagos soon after he arrived from a trip to the United States of America and Ghana. We are immensely grateful that his last moments were peaceful and that he died the same way he lived his life – with quiet dignity. “Daddy was an accomplished man on so many levels – a highly respected academic, international public servant, university administrator, intellectual and traditional ruler. He held: BSc Mathematics, London, UK; Msc Mathematics, Erlangen, Germany; MSc Economics, Erlangen, Germany; Phd Mathematical Statistics, Cologne, Germany.” Reacting to the death, Atiku tweeted on his official Twitter page on Friday, “Obi Prof Chukuka Okonjo, immediate past Obi of Ogwashi-Ukwu, Delta State, was a man of many parts. He left behind indelible footprints. On behalf of my family, I condole with Dr (Mrs) @NOIweala on the loss of her dear father. May his soul rest in eternal peace.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
