The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, says liberating the society will help reduce the level at which women face economic challenges. NAN reports that Amaechi said this at the 2019 World Maritime Day Celebration on Thursday in Lagos. According to him, life is about courage, and so women should stop begging and understand that having appointment in any field is based on merit. “Women need to confront reality and take power by themselves and challenge men in the industry. “They need to discuss issues and tell the society the challenges they are facing, create wealth for themselves and try as much as possible to lift women out of poverty,” he said. Amaechi said that women should be concerned with how to lift more Nigerians out of poverty. The Minister of State for Transportation, Sen. Gbemisola Saraki, on her part, said that gender equality was a principle that had not manifested in the maritime industry. According to her, there is a need to have women at all levels and to explore every avenue to make more of them feature in the industry. “We need to find ways to change the narratives and ensure that these women who have the initiative, who are fearless, graceful, intelligent and have the nerve to take no for an answer have a say in the industry. “We need to ensure that their voices are heard, as in raising women, we will lift Nigeria,” she said.
