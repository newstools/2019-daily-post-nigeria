An election petitions tribunal sitting in Osogbo, the Osun state capital, on Monday sacked a member of the House of Representatives for Ede Federal constituency, Mr Bamidele Salam. Salam, who is a member of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), was removed by the tribunal on the grounds of electoral malpractices. It cancelled results from certain units in four local government areas in the constituency and ordered a rerun election in those areas. In addition to that, the tribunal also declared the state assembly election in Obokun state constituency inconclusive, removing Adewumi Adeyemi, a member of the PDP, who was earlier declared winner of the poll, ordering a rerun in four units where elections were cancelled. It, however, upheld the election of Mulikat Abiola, a member of the All Progressives Congress representing Ifelodun Federal constituency.
