Barcelona striker, Luis Suarez, has admitted they are anticipating a “long and complicated” season, after their “worrying” loss to newly promoted Granada on Saturday. Granada moved to the top of La Liga, after goals from Ramon Azeez and Alvaro Vadillo sealed a 2-0 win at the Estadio Nuevo Los Carmenes. For the Blaugrana, it represented their second defeat in the league away from Camp Nou this season. They were also held 2-2 at Osasuna, leaving them winless in their first three away LaLiga matches for the first time since 1994/1995. “It’s a worrying defeat, and one that hurts. “We have to take a look at a lot of things and be self-critical in order to improve moving forward. “We’re not thinking about last season when we were champions, it’s about analysing the now. Analysing why we’re not winning away, because it’s worrying us. Analysing the lack of chances. “We have to accept that we’re obliged to win games and we’re not doing it. There’s a long way to go [in La Liga], but these are the type of games that can give you the league. It’s going to be a long, complicated year,” Suarez told Movistar after the game.
