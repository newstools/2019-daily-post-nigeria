Chelsea midfielder, Ross Barkley has backed fellow teammate, Mason Mount to make the England squad for Euro 2020. He also described Mount as a ‘brilliant player’ that has a really good technique, adding that he is hungry to improve. DAILY POST reports that Mount has been called up to Gareth Southgate’s squad for England’s Euro 2020 qualifiers against Bulgaria and Kosovo on September 7 and 10 respectively. The 20-year-old has been impressive so far this season under Frank Lampard at Chelsea. He has so far scored two goals in four appearances for Chelsea this season. “I believe Mount will be in the squad 100 per cent when it comes to it,” Barkley was quoted by Evening Standard as saying. “Then it is down to him but I believe he will be [in the team] because of how good he is and the things I have seen this season. “The way he arrives in the box and gets shots away early, it is similar to Lamps. He has a really good technique with how he finishes as well. He is a brilliant player. “He is hungry to improve, hungry to score and hungry to help the team in any way he can, if it is out on the left, in the No10 or in a midfield three.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
