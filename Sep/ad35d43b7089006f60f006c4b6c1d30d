Steven Gerrard has said he is “flattered” by Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp’s suggestion, that he could manage the club once the German leaves. Gerrard, who has been manager of Glasgow Rangers since 2018, is a legend at Anfield, after making 710 appearances in 17 seasons for his boyhood club. In an interview with FourFourTwo recently Klopp said: “If Liverpool were to sack me tomorrow, then maybe Kenny (Dalglish) would be the first choice to replace me, but they would probably bring Stevie down from Glasgow. “If you ask who should follow me, I’d say Stevie. I help him whenever I can.” When asked about the quotes ahead of Rangers’ game against Aberdeen on Saturday, Gerrard said: “I was surprised and flattered at the same time. “But when you read the quote really carefully, like I have, it said ‘if I get sacked tomorrow’ he thinks Steven Gerrard should be the next Liverpool manager. “Jurgen Klopp’s not getting sacked tomorrow. I don’t want him to get sacked tomorrow. He’s doing a fantastic job.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
