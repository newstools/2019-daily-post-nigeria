Barcelona manager, Ernesto Valverde, has taken responsibility for their poor form, after Saturday’s 2-0 loss at Granada. The result confirmed their worst LaLiga start in 25 years. Barca went down to goals from Ramon Azeez and Alvaro Vadillo, as the promoted side moved top of the table. Valverde’s men are seventh after five games. The Catalans have failed to win any of their past seven away games in all competitions, a run that dates back to last season, with pressure growing on the coach. “In the end the actors are the players and the coach is responsible. “I feel responsible for what has happened. You can lose but when you lose you have to deserve to win – and today we have not deserved it. “Away from home we are not reaping good results. When it happens in four games it is already a symptom that we are not too well. “Today we have not been well. Away from home we are not playing good games. We are dominating but we do not translate it into goal situations. It is also true that the opponent is scoring the first goal,” Valverde told a post-match news conference. Valverde however gave credit to Granada, who have won three LaLiga games in a row without conceding a goal. “Granada deserve a lot of credit and we have to recognise it. “They have been intense, strong, they have troubled us a lot. “The first goal has put the game in their hands and they hit us when they hurt us the most. They have made their game and that we have not played well is to their credit,” he added.
