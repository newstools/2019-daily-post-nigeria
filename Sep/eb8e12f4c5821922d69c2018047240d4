The Governorship Election Petition Tribunal in Niger State, has thrown out the petition by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate Umar Nasko, against Governor Abubakar Bello of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The PDP and its candidate are challenging Bello’s victory in the recently held governorship election. They claim he submitted forged certificates to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The Justice John Igboji-led tribunal, while dismissing the petition, said it constitutes an abuse of court process, because it had been heard and decided by a Federal High Court. Consequently, the Tribunal upheld the Preliminary Objection of the 2nd Respondent (APC) against the Petition of Umar Nasko and the PDP.
