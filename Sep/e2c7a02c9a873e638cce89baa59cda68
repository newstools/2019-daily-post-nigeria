Barcelona president, Josep Maria Bartomeu on Friday admitted that captain, Lionel Messi can walk away from the club for free next summer. Messi has a contract at Camp Nou until 2021, but it has been revealed there’s a clause which allows him to leave at the end of each season if he so wishes. The Argentina international would just have to communicate his desire to move on before the end of May. Carles Puyol, Xavi Hernandez and Andres Iniesta all signed similar deals with Barca in the final years of their time at the club, too. Bartomeu is aware of the existence of the clause, but insists he is not worried about Messi quitting Barcelona any time soon. “Messi signed until 2021. It was agreed that at the end of the penultimate season he is at liberty to leave for free,” the Blaugrana president told Barca TV . “He has earned that freedom to decide his future, but he is very Cule and I am calm. Xavi, Iniesta and Puyol had the same clause. “We couldn’t give Messi a different clause, but I repeat, I am in no doubt he will stay for many years.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
