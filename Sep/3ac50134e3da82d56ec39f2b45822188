FIFA, on Monday, announced a final three-man shortlist for this year’s Puskas Award. Lionel Messi’s stunning chip against Real Betis is among the three nominees up for the prestigious best goal gong. Juan Quintero’s amazing long-range free-kick and Daniel Zsori’s last-minute winner for Debrecen against Frencvaros, also make the cut. The original list had names like Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Fabio Quaglierella, Andros Townsend, Ajara Nchout, etc. But fans voted for Messi, Quintero, and Zsori as the final three. FIFA will reveal the winner at The Best Awards on September 23 in Milan. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
