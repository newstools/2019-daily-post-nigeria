Tragedy struck at Akinale, in the Ewekoro Local Government Area of Ogun State, on Tuesday, when a bus being reportedly chased by men of the Nigerian Customs Service for allegedly transporting smuggled cartons of turkey somersaulted and crushed two persons to death. It was gathered that the Customs officers were chasing the suspected smuggler along Abeokuta-Lagos Highway when he lost control and rammed into two innocent persons, including a roadside mechanic. The Towulade of Akinale, Oba Olufemi Ogunleye, described the accident as unfortunate, blaming the driver and the Customs men for the incident. He said, “Today’s accident is unfortunate and regrettable. “It is indiscipline on the side of the driver and equally part of indiscipline on the side of the government agency because the Customs ought to have nipped it in the bud right from the border. They should not be pursuing people on the main road. “They were running after these people but after the accident, they have run away. They didn’t wait.” The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi confirmed the incident. Oyeyemi said, “It’s true the Customs men were chasing the bus and it somersaulted and killed two people.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
