Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is growing increasingly frustrated with Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial’s poacher abilities, according to The Athletic. The duo have led United’s attacking line so far this season and have scored two goals each. After a 4-0 opening day thumping of Chelsea, Solskjaer’s men have picked up two draws and suffered a defeat to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford. Solskjaer made ‘scruffy’ goals his target at United, but feels Rashford and Martial are severely lacking in the department. With teams inviting United to break them down, Solskjaer feels he needs more from his attacking duo. Solskjaer has his forwards running near-post darting runs during training, in an attempt to ensure Martial and Rashford will be in the box more often to tap home.
