Arsene Wenger has said Manchester United is a “dream job” and claimed he has “ideas” about restoring the club to its former glory. Wenger ended his Arsenal career at the end of the 2017/2018 season, after 21 years of service for the Gunners. The Frenchman has mainly appeared as a pundit, but is yet to land a permanent job. “Manchester United is a dream job for any coach. I have confidence, I have courage…and you’re right, I have ideas,” Wenger told Fox Sports Asia. The 69-year-old also believes that United would be capable of contending for honours once more with four key signings. “They need -in my opinion – four first-team players. “But around those players, I see a squad that is capable of challenging. They aren’t as far away as people think. “The team have no pattern of play, no pattern of pressing. There is a team there, but it needs to be coached and developed. Like I said, four players and they can be challengers. For everything,” he added.
