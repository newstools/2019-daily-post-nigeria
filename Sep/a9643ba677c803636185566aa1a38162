Reno Omokri, former Presidential aide, has mocked Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo over his reported threat to sue global search engine, Google Inc. He lampooned Osinbajo on Saturday after the Vice President wrote Google over ‘false allegations‘ made against him on a YouTube page. A video published on September 20 on the video-sharing site by Roots TV Nigeria alleged that Osinbajo “used” federal agencies under his supervision as vice president “to stack funds” for 2023 general elections. The allegation is based mainly on a claim made by Katch Ononuju, described in the report as a political analyst. But the vice president’s lawyers had said in the letter to Google that the report was untrue and defamatory. “The publication is undoubtedly a barefaced attempt to unfairly discredit and expose our client to contempt and ridicule in the eyes of right-thinking members of the society,” the lawyers said. The vice president demanded that Google remove or suspend the publication immediately or be ready for legal action. The letter was delivered to the Google office in Lagos. Reacting via a post on his Facebook page, Omokri wrote: “I use to think Pastor Osinbajo was very intelligent until he threatened to sue Google over a blogger‘s video. “You are a professor of law. Google is just a host! Where is their liability? Is Osinbajo overrated? “I never watched the video, but I understand it was also uploaded on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. “Will Osinbajo sue them too? Nothing has damaged the aura of intelligence around Osinbajo as his threat to sue Google. “Google’s turnover in a year is more than Nigeria’s annual budget. And Osinbajo wants to sue them for hosting a video? With people like these in charge, no wonder Nigeria is now owing P&ID $9 billion.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
