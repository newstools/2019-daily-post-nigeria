The co-convener of the RevolutionNow Movement, Omoyele Sowore, has disclosed that the Department of State Services, DSS, refused him from making calls while granting arrested Boko Haram Boko Haram commanders access to telephone, while in custody. Sowore, who is the 2019 Presidential candidate of the African Action Congress, AAC, made the disclosure when he appeared before a Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday. The Federal Government re-arraigned Sowore for conspiracy to commit treason and insulting President Muhammadu Buhari. According to Sowore: “I am not allowed to see sunshine. I have not been outside except today. I am happy people are staying strong. “I have no doubt this will come to an end in favour of the Nigerian people. Whether you like it or not, the revolution will happen. It is only a matter of time. They gave me no access to telephone. No TV. No newspapers. “What is interesting is that Boko Haram commanders who are engaged in high-level terrorism have access to telephone, TV and even cable in their cells. So you wonder which one is better: a freedom fighter or a terrorist.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
