The Rivers State House of Assembly has proposed three years imprisonment for individuals found guilty of indulging in female circumcision. The lawmakers came up with the resolution after debate on the Rivers State Female Circumcision Abolition Bill of 2019. Majority leader of the House, Martin Ameawhule who led the debate said the bill which seeks to amend Female Circumcision Law of 2001, will address the issues of female circumcision in the state. On his part, Chief Whip of the House, Evans Bipi suggested an increase in the fine stipulated on the previous law. “I think we should increase the fine from N20,000 to whatever the House agrees so that before you think of doing it, you will consider prison or fine,” he said. Speaker of the House, Ikuinyi Owaji Ibani, while commenting on the resolution of the House said the three years imprisonment will come with an option of two hundred thousand naira fine.
