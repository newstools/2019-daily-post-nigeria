Big Brother on Sunday night cancelled all strikes issued to BBNaija housemates. Biggie announced this while the housemates were all gathered in the Arena. This came as a surprise to all housemates as Mercy, Ike, Omashola and Tacha were seen jubilating. Biggie told housemates: “Strikes and warnings have been cancelled. All is forgiven. “It’s now a level playing field for the housemates.” DAILY POST had reported that Biggie had issued Tacha a second strike for disobeying BBNaija rules and undermining authorities. Also, Mercy was given a stern warning for breaking Biggie’s mobile phone weeks ago, while Tacha and Joe were issued a strike. Omatsola and Ike too were given strikes after they broke rules of the house.   See how #Tacha reacted as #bigbrother cancels hers, #Omashola , #Mercy , #Ike ‘s strikes … #bbnaija #bigbronaija #bbnaija2019 #BNxBBNaija4 #BBNaija4 #Bet9ja #Bet9jaBBN #BigBrotherNaija #BigBrother9ja #BellaNaija #Bet9jaBBNEviction #bbnaijapepperdem #Nigerian #nigeriawedding #nigerians #nigeria #Tacha #mike #jeff #sirdee #seyi #ike #mercy #frodd A post shared by  nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen) on Sep 15, 2019 at 3:12pm PDT  Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
