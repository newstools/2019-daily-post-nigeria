Rafael Nadal won his 19th career Grand Slam title on Sunday by winning the US Open final. The 33-year-old beat Russia’s Daniil Medvedev 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 4-6, 6-4 to seize his fourth crown in New York. Nadal’s victory has now moved one shy of Roger Federer’s all-time men’s record 20 Grand Slam triumphs. The Spaniard also became the second-oldest New York champion in the Open era after Ken Rosewall in 1970 at age 35. World number two Nadal took the top prize of $3.85million at Arthur Ashe Stadium and added to his US Open trophy haul from 2010, 2013 and 2017. Nadal, who was in his fifth US Open championship match and 27th Grand Slam final, is the first man to claim five major titles after turning 30.
