The Management of Max Air Operating this year 2019 Hajj Exercise Transportation has denied that their Plane carrying 600 Pilgrims from Mecca Crash Landed at Niger State. The Company Chairman, Dahiru Barau Mangal said in a released that the plane Boeing 744 rather safe landed at the airport in Niger due to lack of Runaway Traffic lights and bad whether. He said how can a plane crash land with 600 passengers without scratch on any of the passenger and the aircraft is not damaged. “Therefore, the reports that our plane crashed landed is untrue and a mischief calculated at tarnishing our long service of safely transportation of Nigerians and others” Reports has it that over 600 pilgrims returning from the 2019 annual pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia crash landed at the Minna International Airport. The aircraft, a Boeing 744 with registration number 5N/ DBK was said to have developed technical fault in one of the plane’s four engines when it approached the Minna airport, something the Chairman described as totally false. “Our Aircraft never developed any engine problems but rather the whether at the airport and the lack of runway light forced us to save landed,” the Chairman added. He said already Pilgrims are in good health who have since met their families, while the aircraft is refilling for further transportation of passengers.
