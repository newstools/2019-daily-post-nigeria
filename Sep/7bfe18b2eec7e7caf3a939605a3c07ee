Atiku Abubakar, 2019 presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has reacted to the death of Robert Mugabe, the immediate past President of Zimbabwe. DAILY POST reported on Friday morning that Mugabe, who was the longest-serving president of Zimbabwe, and forced to resign in 2017 following a protracted intraparty crisis, died at the age of 95. Reacting, Atiku on Twitter said Robert Mugabe was a hero of the African liberation struggle. According to him, ”No man is perfect and he had his flaws, but nobody can take this fact away from him: That he loved his country and its people, and took practical and patriotic steps to improve their well being. ”Mr. Mugabe gave Zimbabwe freedom, which in itself is commendable. Yet, he gave them something greater than freedom. He gave them education. His razor-like focus on investing in education resulted in Zimbabwe having the highest adult literacy rate in Africa. ”One can even say he emancipated the minds of Zimbabweans. Other African leaders can learn from him in this regard. ”As he passes away aged 95, Robert Mugabe lived a long life and cast an even longer shadow. His footsteps in the sands of times are indelible even as they are very far-reaching. ”As African leaders, we have a lot to learn from his many successes, and even more to learn from his inevitable mistakes. ”My condolences to the government and people of Zimbabwe. My heartfelt sympathies to his family. May his soul rest in peace and may God forgive his sins.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
