Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo has revealed that manager, Maurizio Sarri substituted him in his side’s last two games against AC Milan and Lokomotiv Moscow because he was carrying an injury. DAILY POST recalls that the 34-year-old was withdrawn after just 55 minutes against AC Milan in Serie A, while he was also taken off against Lokomotiv Moscow in the Champions League a few days earlier. Speaking to A Bola after scoring in Portugal’s 2-0 victory over Luxembourg in a Euro 2020 qualifier encounter on Sunday, Ronaldo said: “In the last three weeks I have been playing with limitations. “Everyone knows that I don’t like to be substituted, but there was no problem in my gestures after the change. I tried to help Juventus by playing injured. “Nobody likes to be replaced, but I understood it because I wasn’t in such good shape.” Ronaldo added: “I sacrificed myself for the team. We could have missed out [on Euro 2020]. Thankfully, I haven’t been injured much in my career but it can happen. “It’s a pain that prevents me from being 100%, but I always try to play. They created a big controversy where it didn’t need to exist. I’ll be back to 100% soon.” Ronaldo will now hope to lead Juventus to victory when they take on Atalanta in the Serie A fixture on Saturday.
