Mauricio Pochettino is ready to snub interest from Arsenal, so he can land a bigger job in Europe, according to the Daily Star. The Argentine was recently sacked as Tottenham Hotspur and replaced by Jose Mourinho. However, Pochettino is not interested in attracting the ire of Spurs fans by crossing the North London divide. He has been linked with the Arsenal role, after Unai Emery was fired on Friday, along with Brendan Rodgers, Mikel Arteta, Massimiliano Allegri and Carlo Ancelotti. Former Arsenal winger, Freddie Ljunberg, has been put in temporary charge of the team and will lead the Gunners out against Norwich on Sunday.
