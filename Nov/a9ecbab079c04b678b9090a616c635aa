The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Friday berated the All Progressives Congress (APC) for allegedly sending armed thugs to invade the venue of the meeting of its leaders, including Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde and its candidate, Engr. Musa Wada, in Lokoja. PDP claimed that several “hooded APC thugs, armed with automatic rifles and other dangerous weapons, invaded the venue of the meeting which had Governor Makinde, Engr. Wada, his running mate, Hon. Samuel Aro, the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, as well as other party chieftains in attendance.” The opposition party stated this in a statement signed by its spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan. According to the statement: “It took the resistance of the security personnel attached to Governor
Makinde to save the situation, which would have turned calamitous, as the people of Kogi who were around the venue were already poised for a stiff confrontation. “APC ought to have known by now that their reliance on thugs and violence cannot thrive, as the people are ready to defend their state in this election. “We urge the Inspector General of Police Mohammed Adamu to caution the APC as well as put every measure in place to check the activities of APC’s thugs so as to ensure a hitch-free, transparent and credible election on Saturday.” PDP urged the people of Kogi State to remain alert and resolute in their determination to assert their will despite the machinations designed to undermine their spirit at the election. “It also states that Nigerians should hold the APC and Governor Yahaya Bello responsible should any harm whatsoever befall any PDP member during the period of the election,” the statement added.
