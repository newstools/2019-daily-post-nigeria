The Court of Appeal sitting in Makurdi, on Wednesday affirmed the election of the Speaker of Benue State Assembly, Titus Uba, representing Kyan state constituency. Justice E. J. Ekanem, in his lead judgment, held that the appeal brought against the Speaker by the All Progressives Congress (APC)’s Gwaza Ujamatyu, lacked merit. Consequently, Justice Ekanem dismissed the appeal and upheld the earlier decision of the National/State Assembly Election Petition tribunal which favoured PDP’s Uba. The court held that since the appellants failed to raise any ground of their appeal challenging the decision of the tribunal with respect to evidence of their witnesses, it therefore marked the end of the evidence of the witnesses forever. Reacting, the Speaker through his Chief of Staff, Terkimbi Akaaka, applauded the judgment He added that the decision of the court reflected the wishes of the masses.
