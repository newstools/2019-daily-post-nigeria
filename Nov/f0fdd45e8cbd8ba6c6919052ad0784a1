Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has insisted that Kylian Mbappe’s dream, is to play for the Spanish giants. Mbappe was linked with a move from Paris Saint-Germain to Madrid last summer, but ended up staying with the Ligue 1 side. Zidane spoke about his compatriot’s desire to play for Los Blancos and his comments annoyed PSG’s sporting director Leonardo. Leonardo called on Zidane to stop “destabilising” Mbappe, but the Real boss is refusing to budge. “All I said was something that Kylian Mbappe had already said himself – that it was his dream to one day wear Real Madrid’s white jersey. “That’s all I said, and I’m saying it again today and I would repeat it again everyday. I have nothing more to say about Leonardo, I can say whatever I want,” Zidane retorted during Friday’s press conference.
