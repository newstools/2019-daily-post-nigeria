Mikel Arteta is ready to hold talks with Arsenal about replacing Unai Emery as manager, according to the UK Times. Emery got the job ahead of Arteta in 2018, after Arsene Wenger stepped down following his 22-year reign at Arsenal. Arteta, who played for the Gunners as a player from 2011 to 2016, retained his job as Pep Guardiola’s assistant manager at Manchester City. However, Arsenal are struggling under Emery this season and have failed to win in their past six fixtures. Arteta is now keen to talk to the Arsenal board about possibly replacing his compatriot. However, the Gunners chiefs are also interested in speaking to Massimiliano Allegri, who has been out of work since stepping down at Juventus.
