Everton on Tuesday confirmed that midfielder, Andre Gomes, has been discharged from the hospital following the player’s horrific injury during the Toffees’ 1-1 draw with Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Sunday. The Premier League club made this known in a statement on the club’s official website. The statement read: “Following a successful operation yesterday, Andre Gomes has now been discharged from hospital and will continue his rehabilitation under the care of the Everton medical team. “The Blues midfielder underwent surgery to repair a fracture dislocation to his right ankle yesterday, with the procedure going extremely well.” DAILY POST recalls that Gomes suffered the horrific leg injury following a challenge by Tottenham’s Son Heung-min during both side’s 1-1 Premier League draw at Goodison Park on Sunday. Gomes was immediately taken to hospital in an ambulance, after being treated on the pitch. Referee Martin Atkinson originally handed Son a yellow card, but quickly upgraded his decision to a red card, after seeing the extent of the damage to Gomes.
