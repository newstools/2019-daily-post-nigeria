The acting Chairman of Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Alhaji Musa Liman Kwande, has said northerners will vote for only a presidential candidate of northern origin in 2023 irrespective of their political party. Daily Trust sports reports that Kwande stated this on Sunday in Lafia, Nasarawa state. “I am expressing my opinion as a full-pledged Northerner and a citizen of Nigeria and not that of ACF”, he said. “Northern Nigerians who are tested and trusted should contest for any political office with anybody from any part of Nigeria and the people should exercise their democratic franchise to vote for their candidate of choice.” The Baraden-generalissimo of Lafia, added, “Nigeria is our country, we must unite and develop it despite being from different geographical locations. “We should not relent in the pursuit of growth and development as we are blessed with gifted people and many resources, as only Nigerians would develop the country to greater heights.” Kwande urged Northerners to strive towards developing the region by voting for people who are pro-development and not those who are self-centred. He called on politicians to accept election results and be statesmen and advised youths should avoid being used as political thugs.
