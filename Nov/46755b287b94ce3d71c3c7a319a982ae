Arsenal are facing uncertainty over the future of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette, the Daily Mail reports. Senior officials at the Emirates, fear that they could lose their best players, if Unai Emery remains in charge next season. Aubameyang and Lacazette are in talks over new deals, but neither seem particularly eager to sign as things stand. Both are keen to play Champions League football but, with Arsenal currently eighth and without a win in five games, that seems less and less likely. Arsenal would have to pay at least £4m in compensation to sack Emery before the end of the season, though after pay-outs to his backroom staff the final total could rise significantly.
