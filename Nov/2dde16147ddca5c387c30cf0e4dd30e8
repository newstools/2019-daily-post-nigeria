A media aide of Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, Salihu Tanko Yakasai also known as Dawisu has lambasted the Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II for advocating jail term for parents of children adopted in the state. Dawisu, who is the Director-General, Media and Communications of the Kano State Government, dared the Emir to shut up his “filthy mouth” for advocating jail term for parents of the kidnapped children. Emir Sanusi had over the weekend said the Igbo should not be attacked over the abduction of the children. He said rather, the parents of the children should be blamed for the incident, stressing that many Northern parents had the bad habit of allowing their children roam the streets to beg, thereby making them vulnerable. However, Yakasai rubbished the position of the monarch. In a tweet, Yakassai wrote: “A very reckless comment to make. I wonder if any of his relatives get kidnapped or stolen, he will act the same way. “The kids are not almajiris for goodness sake. SLS (Sanusi Lamido Sanusi) should have kept quiet instead of opening his filthy mouth to make such insensitive remarks. Nonsense!” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
