A Non- governmental Organization (NGO), YIAGA AFRICA, Watching The Votes, has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to extend the voting period for the ongoing gubernatorial election in Bayelsa and Kogi States. The organization posited that the plea is based on the late commencement of elections in some polling units in the two states owing to inadequate and late deployment of security officials. In a statement, signed and sent by the Chair, YIAGA AFRICA, working group, Dr. Hussaini Abdu, and the Executive Director, YIAGA AFRICA, Samson Itodo, through email to DAILY POST, noted that the extension will ensure eligible voters are not disenfranchised. The statement reads in part, “Following late commencement of elections in some polling units in Bayelsa and kogi state owing to inadequate and late deployment of security officials to accompany INEC officials and materials to the polling units, YIAGA AFRICA calls on the INEC to extend the voting period from 2pm to 5pm for affected polling units in Bayelsa and 2pm to 4pm for affected polling units in Kofi state” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
