Former Tottenham boss, Mauricio Pochettino, has issued a first statement since his sacking as the manager of the club nine days ago. The Argentine was dismissed by the club after five and a half years and just four months since guiding them to their first ever Champions League final. Tottenham begun the season in poor form, winning just three of 12 league games to leave them in 14th – and 11 points off the top four – prompting chairman Daniel Levy to make a decision he was “extremely reluctant” to make. Jose Mourinho was appointed as his successor less than 12 hours later, going on to win his opening two games in charge. A statement, via the League Managers’ Association, read, “I would like to thank Joe Lewis and Daniel Levy for giving me the opportunity to be part of Tottenham Hotspur’s history. “I would like to thank also everyone I met at Tottenham, all the club staff and the football players during these five and a half years. “Finally I would like to give a special mention to the fans who make this club so great with their fantastic support. “I gave the best of me to accomplish the objectives I was asked for in our first meeting. There were equally tough challenges as exciting success. “Best wishes for the future, I am sure we will cross paths again.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
