The Court of Appeal, Jos division, has upheld the judgement by the election petition tribunal that sacked Tata Umar as the All Progressives Congress, APC, lawmaker representing Zaki Federal Constituency of Bauchi State. Umar had appealed the ruling which ordered for his ouster from the House of Representatives. However, the appellate court, in its consensus judgement by Justice Moses Ugor, said the decision of the tribunal was right. The judge, therefore, ordered for a rerun election in three polling units in the Zaki Federal Constituency. They are Dungumari, Murmur kofar Fada and Zainadagu. The tribunal, on September 20, directed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct fresh election in the affected units. The order was sequel to the petition filed by Auwal Jatau of the PDP, challenging the victory of Tata. Justice Hafsa Abdurrahman explained that out of the 10 polling units that were presented by the first petitioner (Jatau) as witnessing irregularities, only three were found to be true.
