The governor of zamfara State, Hon. Bello Mohammed Matawalle has revealed that the American government has exempted Zamfara from among terrorists states. Speaking in Gusau Government House while receiving thousands of All Progressives Congress (APC) supporters who had embraced the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Sunday, at the state Government House in Gusau, the state capital, the Governor said, “Zamfara was one of the states in Nigeria where the American Government warned its people to stay clear and avoid visiting the states. “The American government had, just last week, exempted Zamfara State from dangerous places in Nigeria as a result of the peace accord and reconciliation initiatives by this administration in order to bring to an end all forms of criminality in the state.” He appealed to the opposition parties to join hands with his government for sustaining the peace for the rapid development of the state. He, however, warned that he would not hesitate to take drastic actions against any person or group of persons who tried to undermine the security arrangements put in place by his administration. “I am aware of the moves by some destructive elements trying to create problems in our state for their selfish interest because they are not comfortable with the success my government recorded within few months of taking over. “I want the whole world to hear me very clearly that I will not hesitate to deal ruthlessly with anybody or group of persons who venture into thwarting the peace accord and reconciliation deal irrespective of their position. “Nobody would be seen as a sacred cow of or very untouchable because the law is never a respecter of anybody,” he warned. The Governor said the former APC supporters took a right decision at the right time.
