Manchester United legend, Gary Neville, has shockingly described Liverpool’s Roberto Firmino as the best centre-forward in the Premier League. Liverpool defeated Premier League holders, Manchester City 3-1 on Sunday at Anfield, stretching their lead at the top of the table to eight points. The goals came from Fabinho, Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah, but it was Firmino who Neville singled out for praise after another fantastic performance from the Brazilian. The Brazilian’s work-rate and link-up play was fantastic, as usual, and Neville believes he is a better centre-forward than Sergio Aguero, who again failed to score at Anfield. “Liverpool’s front three are magical, they’re a joy to watch,” Neville told Sky Sports. “I think he’s the best centre forward in the league, Firmino. If you said to me you can have one centre-forward to have in your team, it would be him.” Firmino has not been prolific this season, with three goals in 18 appearances across all competitions He has managed 69 goals in 210 appearances for the Reds.
