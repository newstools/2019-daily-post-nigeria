Juventus midfielder, Aaron Ramsey, has disclosed that he apologised to fellow teammate, Cristiano Ronaldo after denying him the opportunity to score in their side’s 2-1 victory over Lokomotiv Moscow in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday. Ronaldo curled a free-kick from the left flank and Lokomotive goalkeeper, Guilherme, let the ball slip through his hands and almost rolled completely over the line before Ramsey pushed it into the net and the former Arsenal star was awarded the goal. However, Douglas Costa scored a late goal after Aleksei Miranchuk had equalised for Lokomotive as Maurizio Sarri’s side defeated the host and qualified for the round of 16. “I thought the keeper was a lot closer to me and had a chance of diving back and maybe clearing it,” Ramsey told reporters after the match. “My instinct took over to make sure that it went over the line. I’ve apologized to Cristiano.” “We still have work to do to finish top but we achieved our target of qualifying tonight, so we’re happy that we’ve done that,” Ramsey said.
