Arsenal hero, Paul Merson has identified Chelsea stars, Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount and Christian Pulisic as the three Blues players that can end Manchester City’s hope of winning the English Premier League, EPL, title this season. Merson believes the trio can inflict more pain on Pep Guardiola’s side in their title defence this term when both teams clash on November 23 at Etihad after the international break. Man City are currently nine points behind league leaders, Liverpool following their 3-1 defeat to Jurgen Klopp’s side at Anfield some days ago. “You have to remember that City have Chelsea at home next who are good going forward and you are talking about a team who are going to give you problems at the back with Abraham, Mount and Pulisic,” Merson told Sky Sports. “This is going to be a problem game and if they do not win that game and Liverpool win against Palace. “City have to get through their next six or seven games before they can be title contenders again. They have not got a good run, but if they win all of them and are still in the title race come Christmas, then I will go fair enough.” Merson added: “Liverpool have lost one game in the last 51 and they have played City three times in that time, so I just do not see them losing four or five games ’till the end of the season.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
