Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has said he cannot wait to play Arsenal, following the club’s decision to sack Unai Emery. Mourinho was confirmed as Spurs new boss last week, taking over from Mauricio Pochettino. The Portuguese is now relishing the chance to compete in the North London derby, when Tottenham host Arsenal in April. “I look forward to playing against Arsenal. I want to play against Arsenal. I know what it means for our fans. “But with Mauricio or Emery or Freddie Ljungberg or whoever else, that’s no problem. “I know the big ones and I know that’s a big one. Not just because Arsenal is a big club that fights for the same objectives as we do. But also I know the meaning. And I like it,” Mourinho told a press conference on Friday.
