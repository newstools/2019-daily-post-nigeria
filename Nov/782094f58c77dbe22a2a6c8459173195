Despite the availability of new farm produce in Yobe state residents say the price of farm produce have continued to skyrocket in most markets across the state. Our Correspondent, who took a sample survey across some market in Potiskum and other local governments discovered that,100kg of Millet went up from N7000 to N8000, 100kg bag of Beans which sold at N9,000 few months ago now sells at N11,000, 100kg bag of groundnut moved up from N14,000 to N15,000, 100kg bag of guinea corn also jumped from N6,500 to N8,000 respectively. At Potiskum town which is the largest farm produce and animals market in West Africa and Damaturu the state capital, it was observed that thousands of bags of harvested farm produce brought for sale by farmers to the market were left unattended due to hike in price. The Chairman Yobe State farmers council, Alhaji Ibrahim Gurugusku told our Correspondent that farmers had witnessed a bumper harvest, however, the closure of border is said to have led to the new development in commodity pricing across the state. Alhaji Ibrahim Gurugusku also commended Buni/Gubana administration for allocating the sum of N4.644bn to agricultural sector, noting that, this would boost the agricultural activities in the state.
