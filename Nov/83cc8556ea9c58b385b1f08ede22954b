As at press time, results are being gathered and announced in different polling units and collation centers in the state. The supplementary election is between the candidates of the All Progressives Congress, APC, and that of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Melaye and Adeyemi are engaged in a fresh battle of who occupies the Kogi West senatorial district after the former, who is the sitting lawmaker lost in court. The Court of Appeal had declared the seat vacant when it upheld the decision of the Tribunal which had earlier sacked Dino Melaye. Melaye is running on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) while Adeyemi is carrying the APC’s flag. Recall that INEC had on November 18 declared the Kogi West Senatorial election as ‘inconclusive. The returning officer, Professor Olayinde Lawal, said the margin between the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Smart Adeyemi and that of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Senator Dino Melaye is 20,570. He said Adeyemi polled a total of 80,118 votes, while Melaye got 59,548 votes from the seven Local Government Areas in the senatorial district. Prof Lawal explained that the total margin between both candidates is lower than the 43,127 registered voters in 53 polling units of 20 registration areas in the zone where elections were cancelled. Meanwhile, voting across 53 polling units has been marred with voters’ apathy.
