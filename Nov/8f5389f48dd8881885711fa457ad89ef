The Edo State Police Command has arrested a 42-year-old electrician, who allegedly pretended to be a lawyer and defrauded two single mothers. It was gathered that the suspect, Uchenna Duru, promised to marry a single mother in Owerri, Imo State but never turned up on the wedding day despite preparations. It was learnt that he was arrested after one Mrs. Ruth Abdulahi reported that he defrauded her of undisclosed amount of money and Toyota Camry car number GU 514 LV. Uchenna, who was paraded by the police, had allegedly promised to marry a friend of Ruth, one Madam Adams Dora, whom he met on social media. It was gathered that a wedding introduction was conducted and Uchenna collected N1million from Dora under the pretence of buying her a car worth N2.5m ahead of the wedding in December, 2018 but never showed up for the wedding. It was also learnt that after the suspect’s arrest, another lady, Faith Eriamiatoe turned up alleging that he also promised to marry her but defrauded her of N73,000 on the pretence to supply her auction goods from the Nigeria Custom Service (NCS). While being paraded by police, Uchenna said he did not defraud the ladies but left one of them because she had four children. “I studied Law at the Imo State University but never went to Law School. “I am an electrician and also import goods from abroad. I did not defraud the women. “All those things they are saying are lies. I paid the bride price for Dora. I left Dora because she has four children and I cannot take care of them,” he said.
