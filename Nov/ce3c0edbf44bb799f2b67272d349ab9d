U.S. President Donald Trump indicated publicly on Monday that he might be willing to testify in the impeachment inquiry. “Even though I did nothing wrong, and don’t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea and will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!” Trump said on Twitter. The House of Representatives have not formally called Trump as a witness in the inquiry into whether he tried to get Ukraine to investigate domestic opponent Joe Biden, a leading contender for the Democratic nomination in 2020. Democrats are looking into whether Trump withheld $391million to help Ukraine, a US ally, combat Russia-backed separatists as leverage to get Kiev to investigate Biden. The money was later approved by the US Congress. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, on Sunday stated that Trump had every opportunity to present his case. “The president could come right before the committee and speak all the truth that he wants if he wants to take the oath of office..or he can do it in writing. “He has every opportunity to present his case”, Pelosi said in a CBS interview.
