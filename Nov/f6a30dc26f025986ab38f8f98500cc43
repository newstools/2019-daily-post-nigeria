Former Presidential candidate of the National Action Council (NAC), Dr. Olapade Agoro on Friday asked Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State to probe the kidnap of three (3) Chinese citizens and the killing of a Police Officer in the state. DAILY POST gathered that the Police in Osun State on Tuesday, confirmed the abduction of three Chinese expatriates by some suspected gunmen in Itagunmodi, Atakumosa West Local Government Area of Osun State. The command also confirmed the murder of a police officer attached to them. But, Agoro while reacting condemned the kidnapping of the three foreigners as well as the killing of the Police officer. Agoro in a statement made available to DAILY POST in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital described the incident as an affront at the law enforcement agencies with the evil intentions of discouraging and disorganizing them. He said, “The killing of a police officer in the incident should be seen as an affront on the law enforcement agencies with evil intention to discourage and disorganized them. “The work of insiders must not be ruled out to prevent further occurrences. “Kidnap of 3 Chinese investors, killing of a Police Officer at Itagunmodi, Atakumosa, Osun state is sad and embarrassing, it should not be allowed to dampen the spirit of the good work being done by Governor Adegboyega Oyetola. “Rather it should be seen as a surmountable challenge with good and strategic planning. Agoro then charged security agencies in and across the state to put in more efforts in ensuring adequate security of the people of Osun state as well as their property.
