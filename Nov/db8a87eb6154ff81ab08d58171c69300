Jigawa State and Local Government Contributory Pension Scheme have warned retirees to be careful against the action of impersonators. Executive Secretary of the scheme, Alh Hashim Ahmad Fagam, stated this while briefing newsmen after payment of retirement benefits to 362 beneficiaries. He explained that the board does not have any officer outside its office assigned to collect money from any retiree on any reasons for him to get his benefit. “Some people are in the habit of asking money from retirees to workout for their benefits.” He urged the retirees to report anybody requesting money from them before their benefit is released. Hashim noted that anybody arrested will be dealt with according to the law. Jigawa State Government has spent over 629m for the payments of 362 state and local government retirees for the month of October 2019.
