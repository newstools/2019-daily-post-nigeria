Arsenal goalkeeper, Emiliano Martinez, has blamed himself and his teammates for the sack of manager, Unai Emery. He also expressed his gratitude to Emery for the impact he had on his career at Arsenal. Emery was dismissed on Friday following Arsenal’s 2-1 defeat at home to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League on Thursday night. Freddie Ljungberg, who was already part of Emery’s first-team coaching staff, will manage the Gunners on an interim basis while the North London outfit look for a permanent replacement for the Spaniard. “Thank you Unai and Javi I’m sorry we let you down,” Martinez posted on Instagram. “It’s our fault for not performing the right way, I’m sure we will meet again.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
