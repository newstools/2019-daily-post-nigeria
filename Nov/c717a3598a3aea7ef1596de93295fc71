Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has said Kylian Mbappe is too expensive for the club. Reports this week, that the Reds were considering joining the race to sign the Paris Saint-Germain forward, who has been heavily linked with Real Madrid. But while Klopp is a big fan of the 20-year-old, he stressed that Liverpool simply can’t afford to sign Mbappe. “Ok, from a sporting point of view, there are not a lot of reasons to not sign Mbappe, what a player he is. “But it is about the money of course. No chance. Absolutely no chance, sorry for killing that story. I don’t think there is a club in the world that can buy Kylian Mbappe from PSG. And we are involved in that too. We cannot do it, it is as easy as that. “We have nothing [more] to say about it to be honest, but [buying] this calibre of player is difficult,” Klopp told reporters on Friday.
