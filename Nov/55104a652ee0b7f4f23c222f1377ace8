A retired Assistant Inspector General of Police, Mr Chris Ezike, has lamented that Nigeria was under-policed. He warned that not much may be achieved in security until community policing effectively commenced. NAN reports that Ezike, who was in-charge of Zone 4 of Nigeria Police Force in Makurdi, spoke on Sunday at the Cathedral Church of the Advent, Life Camp, Abuja. The ex-AIG also appealed to Nigerians to put the interest of the country first before personal interests. He said: ”When you want to fashion out how you police a place, the people must contribute. They must be part of making the policies to secure them. ”We must take security down to the smallest unit, traditional rulers, community leaders have roles to play. We must carry out structural adjustment about our policing. ”The UN says 1 policeman to every 100 persons, we are grossly under-policed and equipped. Policing is now a matter of technology, intelligence. It has to be intelligence driven. ”We must pay attention to involving communities in securing themselves and generating enough intelligence to be able to secure the people”.
