Super Falcons striker, Asisat Oshoala, is in hot water with Barcelona, over a tweet she sent out on Tuesday night. Oshoala, who plays for the women’s side, wrote “what a damn performance”, after the men’s team drew 0-0 with Slavia Prague at the Camp Nou. According to AS, she quickly deleted the tweet, due to “an action from the club towards her”. The result sees Ernesto Valverde’s still top of Group F with eight points, one more than Borussia Dortmund. Both sides clash in the next Match Day, with qualification for the Round of 16 up for grabs.
