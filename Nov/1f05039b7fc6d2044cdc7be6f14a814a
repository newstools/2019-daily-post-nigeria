Paris Saint-Germain manager, Thomas Tuchel has labelled superstar, Neymar ‘too provocative’ and ‘not easy to manage’. Tuchel said this ahead of his side’s UEFA Champions League clash against Real Madrid on Tuesday night. “Neymar has a huge heart but unfortunately he doesn’t always show that he’s a generous and reliable guy,” Tuchel said in his pre-match press conference. “Sometimes he’s provocative and it’s a real shame because it’s not necessary. “Yes, yes I have told him that. “We laugh a lot together and I always try to say the truth. “He accepts it, but it’s difficult. He is provocative when he feels things aren’t going well, not when he’s calm.” Tuchel may likely feature Neymar against Real Madrid tonight Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
