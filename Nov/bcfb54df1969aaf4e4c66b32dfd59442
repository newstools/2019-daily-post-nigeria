Burna Boy has broken silence On his planned visit to South Africa for a concert despite his earlier comment that he would stop travelling to the country. DAILY POST recalls that Burna Boy in the wake of xenophobic attacks in September said he would not visit South Africa unless the government resolves the issue. However, Burna Boy has been listed among artists that would be performing in ‘ ‘Africa Unite’ concert on the 24th of November 2019 in South Africa as part of the Africans Unite line-up. His inclusion has met backlash from South Africans who have called for his exclusion from the concert But, Burna Boy reacting on his Twitter page, said he will contribute a portion of the proceeds from the concert to the victims of xenophobic attacks. He, however, did not give reasons for rescinding his promise not to visit South Africa. On his Twitter page, the ‘African Giant’ as popularly called wrote: “The first of many! Part of the proceeds will be donated to the victims of Xenophobic attacks by me! “I really hope we can all keep contributing in our own way to make the world a better and safer place for each other. Africans unite, it’s bigger than all of us.”
