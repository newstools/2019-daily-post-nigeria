The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Osun State has given an award for outstanding performance to a corps member, Oladapo Atoyebi, who embarked on plantation of cucumber on a hectare of land in the state. Oladapo, who is of batch B, is presently undergoing her 12-month mandatory service at Ikoyi town, in Isokan Local Government Area of Osun. The award was presented to the corps member during the closing ceremony of 2019 Batch ‘C’ Stream I orientation course at the NYSC permanent camp, Ede, Osun State, on Monday. The NYSC state coordinator, Adegoke Adewale in his remarks reiterated the commitment of the corps towards redirecting the career ambition of youths through skill acquisition and entrepreneurship. According to him, the notion behind exposing corps members to such programmes while in camp is to create viable alternatives for them in the future against seeming unavailability of white-collar jobs. He said: “NYSC management has gone a long way to ensure a brighter future for yous after the service year by introducing Skill Acquisition and Entrepreneur Development Programmes, purposely to empower you to be self-reliant “. The corps member, while speaking narrated how she approached the head of Ikoyi community for a piece of land to embark on the farming project. “When I came to camp, I attended a program called SAED, in my course of the programme, I choose Agro-allied and they told us about cucumber farming. With the skills gained from the programme, on June 19, 2019, after the camp, I ventured into cucumber farming, and it is really going on well,” Atoyebi said.
