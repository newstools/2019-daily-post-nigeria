There have been resounding calls by some aggrieved leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) across the nation that the party’s National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, should resign for alleged dictatorial tendencies and unconstitutional moves. But Chairman of the Ogun State Chapter of the APC loyal to former Governor, Ibikunle Amosun, Chief Derin Adebiyi, said any discussion about Oshiomhole “is a waste of time”. Adebiyi had in an interview in August taken a swipe at Oshiomhole, saying he will not leave his office an honourable man. The Derin Adebiyi-led APC executive in Ogun had in 2018 filed a suit to challenge its dissolution by Oshiomhole for alleged anti-party activities. Oshiomhole had replaced the elected executive, loyal to former Governor, Ibikunle Amosun, with a three-man caretaker committee led by Yemi Sanusi. However, the court has since ordered that status quo be maintained on the matter which is scheduled for hearing on Tuesday. Speaking in a telephone conversation with DAILY POSTon Saturday, Adebiyi said he does not understand why Oshiomhole who calls himself the National Chairman of the APC would continue to run the party the way he is currently doing. The embattled Chairman, who is optimistic of victory in court, said he does not like to talk about Oshiomhole, saying, “I have said enough, two interviews, two letters and what have you. But talking about Oshiomhole is like wasting one’s time. I don’t know how somebody who says he’s the National Chairman will be running a political party like this. It’s unbeneficial to anybody talking about Oshiomhole. That’s the truth.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
