Manchester City forward, Raheem Sterling has reacted to the decision of England coach, Gareth Southgate, to drop him from the Three Lion’s squad for Thursday’s Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro. DAILY POST had reported on Monday that Southgate will not select Raheem Sterling for Thursday’s Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro, following an incident at their St George’s Park training base. The incident is reported to have involved Joe Gomez, with both players having clashed during Liverpool’s 3-1 win over Manchester City on Sunday. However, Sterling is set to remain with the squad and could play in England’s upcoming match against Kosovo. Reacting through his Instagram page, Sterling said he and Joe have had words about the incident and have moved on, adding that England needs to focus on their match on Thursday. He wrote: “Both Joe and I have had words and figured things out and moved on. “We are in a sport where emotions run high and I am man enough to admit when emotions got the better of me. “This is why we play the sport, because of our love for it. I and Joe are good, we both understand it was a 5-10 second thing. It’s done we move forward and not make this bigger than it is. Let’s get focus on our game on Thursday.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
