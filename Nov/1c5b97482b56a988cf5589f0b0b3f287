More than 1,000 dormant Special Marshals of the Federal Road Safety Corps, FRSC, in Lagos State had been shown the way out in the last two years. The State Coordinator, Olusola Olojede, disclosed this on Thursday in an interview with NAN, at the 2019 Sectoral Workshop of the volunteer arm of FRSC in Lagos. “We have over 1500 special marshals in Lagos officially, we have removed so many people for inactiveness. Right now, we intend to recruit more than a thousand. “If you are not active, we remove you. We don’t want people who just wear the kits for wearing sake. “We have removed over a thousand in the last two years because in Lagos, we used to have over 3000 special marshals,” Mr Olojede said. He said that the workshop brought together Special Marshals in the state to share experience on how to improve service for more productivity. Olojede urged the government to help in maintenance of road infrastructure to reduce accidents. “We have done very well and we are going to do more. That is why after this event, we are going to try and get more special marshals recruited to take care of the traffic population in Lagos. “The population in Lagos is huge, so we need to have more people,” he said. The state coordinator urged road users to respect other motorists and be patient on the road to reduce rates of crashes and fatalities.
