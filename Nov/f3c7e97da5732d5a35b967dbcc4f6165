The Department of State Services, DSS, on Tuesday said it can’t release, Omoyele Sowore, convener of RevolutionNow Movement from its detention facility because he may be knocked down by a vehicle on his way out. DSS spokesperson, Peter Afunanya made the disclosure while addressing journalists in Abuja. Afunanya said, “We cannot just release Sowore and ask him to go because he may be knocked down by a vehicle at the gate.” Pointing out that Sowore’s lawyer, Femi Falana, was yet to come forward and fetch him from their facility, Afunanya said the Senior lawyer had not been to the headquarters of the service since the activist was granted bail. He maintained that the secret police was following administrative procedures by insisting that Sowore’s sureties come forward for proper documentation. “We respect rules and orders of the court and there was never a time the Director-General said he would not release Sowore,” he said. Sowore is currently held in custody of the secret police against court order. A Federal High Court in Abuja had recently ordered the release of Sowore alongside Olawale Adebayo. The DSS is yet to comply with the order and claimed that no surety had come to take Sowore on bail. Few weeks ago, a group of protesters led by Deji Adeyanju alleged that they were given N1m to stop the protest demanding Sowore’s release. The DSS, however, said it will release Sowore if his sureties come forward for documentation.
