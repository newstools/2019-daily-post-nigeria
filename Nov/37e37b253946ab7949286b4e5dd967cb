A Chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in Anambra State and a governorship hopeful, Mr Ike Oligbo has said that zoning the governorship position in the state would engender division and destroy the unity that exists among the people of the state. Oligbo spoke yesterday in Awka while addressing local government area executives of the party in a function organised to disclose his intention to contest in the Anambra governorship election in 2021. When asked his opinion on the clamour for the position to be zoned to the southern senatorial zone, Oligbo said, “Zoning is not right. Anambra people are one, talking about zoning will bring disunity among us. “Besides, there have not been any zoning in the state. Anambra is one people, and the people are always free to contest for positions.” There has been a clamour for power to shift to the southern part of the state as the current governor, Chief Willie Obiano hails from the Northern zone, while his predecessor, Mr Peter Obi hailed from the central zone. Oligbo who declared to run for the position of governor on the platform of PDP hails from Umuoji in Idemili South Local Government Area, which falls into Anambra Central zone. The UK trained lawyer and businessman said he was bringing his wealth of experience in many fields of endeavour, garnered in the UK to ensure the development of the state. He listed power, security, youth employment, education, road construction, healthcare, focus on ecological challenges and many more as some of his priority areas for the state. He solicited support from members of the party to succeed in his pursuit of flying the flag of the party in the election which comes up in 2021 while promising to ensure that members of the party were carried along if he attained his ambition.
