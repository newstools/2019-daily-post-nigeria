A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has been asked to stop the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Engr. Musa Wada, from participating in Saturday’s governorship election on a count of alleged certificate forgery. In a case with suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/1147/2019, the plaintiff, Femi Joseph, alleged that Wada forged his primary school certificate which he filled in the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Form CF001. In the suit filed by his counsel, Mike Enahoro Ebah, the plaintiff is contending that by virtue of Section 31(5) & (6) of the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended), he reasonably believes that the information supplied by Wada in both his Form CF001 and the attached First School Leaving Certificate as to his primary school education were false. He prayed the Court to determine that the information submitted by the PDP flagbearer was indeed false and, on that basis, disqualify him from contesting in the gubernatorial elections. He asked the court to determine the following issues: Whether having regard to the clear and unambiguous provisions of Section 31 (5) and (6) of the Electoral Act, 2010 (As Amended), 3rd Defendant’s INEC FORM CFOO1 and the Primary School Certificate, bearing Number: 910922, attached therewith and submitted to the 2nd Defendant by the 1st and 3rd Defendants, contain false information regarding the 3rd Defendant’s Primary School Certificate.
