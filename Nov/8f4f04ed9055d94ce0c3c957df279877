Amidst insecurity, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Saturday, urged the security forces to protect the people of Bayelsa and Kogi as the conduct of gubernatorial elections in the two states turned violent, resulting in the loss of lives. It also urged people of Kogi and Bayelsa states to remain at alert, resist all undemocratic brigand elements and
take all legitimate steps to protect their votes to the very end. Further, the party charged the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, and security forces to ensure that nothing happens to the ballots at every level and that results reflect only the will of the people as expressed at the polling units. PDP spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan expressed these concerns in a statement to DAILY POST. Part of the statement reads, “The party cautioned INEC to note that the people already knew how they voted; they already knew the outcome of the polls at the respective polling units, they already knew how the parties are standing and as such, would never accept any alternation of results at the collation level. “The party also calls on the Inspector General of Police of Police, Mohammed Adamu, and the military high command to be patriotic by taking measures to assist and protect the people, in their quest to protect their votes. “The PDP charges security forces to check the agents of Governor Yahaya Bello and the APC, who are moving around collation centers with armed hoodlums and compromised security personnel, shooting and disrupting collation processes in their desperation to subvert the aspiration of
the people. “The IGP should therefore beef up security at the collation centers to ensure that only legitimate votes count. This is because any result that does not reflect the will of the people will surely not be accepted”.
