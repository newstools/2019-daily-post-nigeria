Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has described the former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Prof. Tam David-West as a nationalist and social critic who always spoke truth to power. Tinubu stated this in his tribute to the Professor of Virology, who died on Monday at the University Teaching Hospital, Ibadan, Oyo State capital, at the age of 83. In a condolence message signed by his Media Aide, Tunde Rahman and sent to DAILY POST, the APC National Leader said he would personally miss the former minister because he was one leader he admired and regularly exchanged ideas with. The message reads: “Prof. Tam David-West was a nationalist, leader of substance and social critic who regularly spoke truth to power. His voice was always that of caution and restraint to steer the leadership away from the path of unconstitutionality and danger. “He was highly-principled and morally upright. Somebody who served as Minister of Petroleum and Energy under Muhammadu Buhari as military leader and won Buhari’s respect and admiration must be a man of integrity and honesty. “David West and I often speak to interface on issues and to exchange ideas. He was one intellectual and leader I admire. I will personally miss him. “I mourn with his family, both immediate and extended. I mourn with the people of Buguma, Kalabari Kingdom, the government and people of Rivers State and Nigeria, which he served selflessly. “My prayer is that God Almighty grant him eternal rest. I also hope and pray that his good legacies will continue to endure.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
