The University of Ibadan chapter of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) on Monday, set up monitoring committee to ensure that none of her members enlist on the Integrated Payment and Personnel Information System. UI ASUU announced the committee at a well attended congress of the union held at the Faculty of Arts of the institution. The congress, which was presided by Professor Deji Omole, ASUU Chairman, resolved to follow the directive of the national leadership of the union not to enlist on IPPIS. ASUU has maintained her stand citing peculiarities and university act while the Federal Government has maintained that none of her employees will be exempted for the enrollment. In a resolution read by the Secretary of the union, Professor Peter Olapegba, the congress resolved to stop work in the event of stoppage of salary of academic Staff. Omole said, “Our position remains that the university autonomy should be respected. We are not under the government MDAs. “There is no threat to us as far as we are concerned. You can also observe that the congress was well attended by our members and they have complied with the position of ASUU leadership. We have also set up a monitoring committee to ensure full compliance.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
