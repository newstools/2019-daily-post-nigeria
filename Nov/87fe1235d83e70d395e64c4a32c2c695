The Cross River State Government has bowed down to pressure and is now set for the conduct of local government elections. The government has slated February 22, 2020 for the conduct of the election. The High Court 4 sitting in Calabar, Cross River State capital and presided over by Hon Justice E. Ita had ordered Governor Ben Ayade to conduct local government elections which would usher in eighteen local government chairmen. The Court in a suit No: HC/514/2018 filed by the APC Chieftain, Chief (Barr) Utum Eteng against Gov. Ben Ayade and his State Attorney General, frowned seriously on the action of the defendants and stated that there was no alternative than to obeying the constitution and the law in the matter of this nature. The Court held that it was a breach of section 7(1) of the 1999 constitution for Gov. Ayade not to conduct election to usher in a democratically elected Local Govt. as contemplated by section 7(1) of the constitution and section 2(1) of the CRS Local Govt. Law 2007. The Court did not find it funny and regretted that more than 3 years after the expiration in December, 2018 of the democratically Local Government Councils put in place in December, 2015, by the Liyel Imoke led State Government, the Ayade Government has not found it proper to do the needful by conducting elections. Consequently, the Cross River State House of Assembly had given the Cross River State Independent Electoral Commission (CROSIEC) an ultimatum to conduct local government elections. On Wednesday, November 27, 2019, CROSIEC in a press briefing held in Calabar, disclosed the timetable of the elections with dates from 27th November, 2019 to 22nd February, 2019.
