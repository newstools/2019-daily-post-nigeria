Adamu disclosed this on Tuesday in Enugu during the train-the-trainers workshop on Trafficking in Persons Issues mainstreamed into Nigeria College of Education (NCE) Minimum Standards. The minister was represented by Mrs Obianuju Anigbogu, the Deputy Director, National and International Partnerships Division of Department of Education Support Services of the ministry, NAN reports. Adamu said that the review had become necessary considering the challenges posed by trafficking in persons in the country. He said that primary and post-primary schools in the country needed to be properly guided on issues of trafficking. Adamu said that migration was inevitable and it was imperative to infuse the studies in the school curriculum so as to prepare the next generation of Nigerians not to fall prey. The minister said that the TIP studies had been mainstreamed in the NCE which necessitated the training. The minister said that the ministry had created a special desk on migration with a view to taking care of migration issues. “It is good that our children have started knowing about human trafficking and the important thing is to know when you are being trafficked. “It is, therefore, necessary to start mainstreaming studies in TIP at all levels of education,” Adamu said.
