Belgium captain, Eden Hazard, has named Real Madrid star, Karim Benzema as the best striker in the world presently. Having shared a dressing room with Benzema for four months, the former Chelsea star is convinced the 31-year-old French star is currently the world’s most in-form striker. Hazard said this ahead of Belgium’s Euro 2020 qualifier with Cyprus on Tuesday. “After having played with Benzema for three or four months, I think he is currently the best striker in the world,” Hazard said at a press conference in Belgium via EFE. “But besides his role as striker, he makes others better.” “It’s always easier to play against a team that Benzema is not in,” he added. Benzema has been impressive for Real Madrid so far this season. He has scored 11 goals in 15 games for Zinedine Zidane’s side so far this term.
