Comptroller General of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Hameed Ali, Wednesday, refused to appear before the House of Representatives over alleged extrajudicial killings by his men in Ogun State border communities. DAILY POST learnt that neither Ali, nor a representative from the NCS was at the sitting, a situation that did not go down well with the lawmakers. A member of the Ogun State House of Assembly, Sikirat Ajibola, representing Idiroko/Ipokia State Constituency, had petitioned the federal parliament over the alleged illegal activities by men of the NCS. Ajibola’s petition was laid at the green chamber through the lawmaker representing Egbado South and Ipokia Federal Constituency, Hon. Kolawole Lawal of the Allied Peoples Movement (APM). DAILY POST recalls that three students of Ojumo Community High School, Ihunbo were reportedly killed on October 7, while market women were injured, when Customs officers were conveying a ‘tokunbo’ vehicle they said was smuggled into the country. https://dailypost.ng/2019/10/ The House, it was gathered, referred the petition to the Committee on Public Petitions, which held its investigative hearing on Wednesday where the Customs boss was expected to appear. The acting Chairman of the committee, Mr Lawal Kenken, expressed his displeasure over the non-appearance of the NCS CG. Kenken was quoted as saying, “The petitioner is here but as you can see, the Customs are not here. It is a most pathetic situation. “From the stamp of the Comptroller-General’s office, they were served this hearing notice and notice of petition was received by the Nigeria Customs on November 6, 2019. Today is November 13, which means they received it seven days ago, and they are not here.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
