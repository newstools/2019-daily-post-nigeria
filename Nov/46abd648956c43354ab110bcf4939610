Arsenal have identified Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo as Unai Emery’s replacement at The Emirates, according to Daily Mail. The newspaper reports that Santo is the leading contender to take over the reins of the Emirate Stadium. Arsenal chiefs are weighing up Emery’s future at the north London side on a game by game basis following their winless run in the Premier League. According to the report, the Arsenal board have been impressed with Santo’s success at Wolves after he won the Championship title in 2017-18 before leading them to a seventh-placed finish last term. The Daily Mail added that Santo’s agent Jorge Mendes already has a long-standing relationship with Arsenal head of football Raul Sanllehi. Arsenal are in eighth place in the Premier League table and a point adrift of fifth-placed Wolves following their 2-2 draw with Southampton last weekend.
