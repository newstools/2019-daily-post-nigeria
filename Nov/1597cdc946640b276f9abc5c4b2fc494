Real Madrid’s coach, Zinedine Zidane has claimed that the only thing that changed in his side since Portugal captain, Cristiano Ronaldo left the Los Blancos for Juventus was that striker, Karim Benzema has become ‘more mature’. Ronaldo left Real Madrid as their all-time highest goalscorer to join the Serie A champions, Juventus in the summer of 2018. But Zidane feels Benzema is now like Ronaldo in the history of Real Madrid after the France star scored a brace in his side’s 6-0 victory over Galatasaray in the Champions League on Wednesday night to reach the 50-goal mark for the club. “His numbers speak for themselves,” Zidane said of Benzema as quoted by Marca after Real Madrid’s win over Galatasaray. “Those that like football know he’s a quality player. He’s important for the team, for attacking… he does it very well. “The only thing that’s changed since Cristiano Ronaldo left for Juventus is that Karim is more mature. “He’s a father and well… many things have happened lately which are reflected on the pitch. I’m very happy for Karim. “It’s true that he’s overtaken a legend of this club like Alfredo di Stefano [by scoring his 50th European Cup goal]. “He’s now like Cristiano Ronaldo in the history of this club. He’s doing something amazing and we simply have to enjoy it and make the most of it.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
