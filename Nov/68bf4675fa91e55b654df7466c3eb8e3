A Court of Appeal sitting in Ilorin, Kwara State, Tuesday, sacked the lawmaker representing Ilorin South Federal Constituency, Hon Abdulazeez Oluwanilo of the All Progressive Congress. The Court also declared the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, House of Assembly candidate for Ilorin South constituency, Hon Abdulraheem Agboola as duly elected. The judgement was delivered by Justice Hammam Barkar Hkawu. The court based its decision on the disputed APC’s primary election, which produced Alhaji Suleiman Abdulsalam popularly known as Sule Cement but was later replaced with a 28-year-old Abdulazeez Oluwanilo. The Appeal Court held that APC had no valid candidate for the 2019 House of Assembly election and thereby declared the candidate with the second-highest votes, which is the PDP candidate, Abdulraheem Agboola. The PDP candidate had challenged the eligibility of the APC candidate and his party’s nomination process at the tribunal. DAILY POST recalls that the election tribunal had earlier ordered fresh election in Ilorin South state constituency. In his reaction, the immediate past Speaker of the House, Hon Ali Ahmad, congratulated Agboola, stressing that he would be one of the ranking members in the House. The Kwara State chapter of the PDP, has also congratulated Agboola on his victory at the Court of Appeal against Oluwanilo of the APC. A statement in Ilorin, Tuesday by the state chairman of the party, Hon Kola Shittu, described “the court’s ruling as a victory for democracy and rule of law.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
