The Imo State government has reiterated that Prof. Amaobi Uwaleke is not the recognized Traditional Ruler of Obibi Uratta autonomous community, Owerri North Local Government Area (LGA). This came following an earlier directive by the Imo State government suspending all activities relating to the coronation of Professor Uwaleke as Obibi Uratta community. Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Chief Uche Onyeagucha, in a statement issued to newsmen and obtained by our correspondent, Tuesday, opined that he (Uwaleke) has no locus-standi to hold any coronation celebration. The statement reads in full, “The Government of Imo State has observed with total dismay, the gross insistence of Professor Amaobi Uwaleke, to hold a ‘One Year Coronation Anniversary’ celebration today November 2, 2019. “The State Government considers this as an act of gross disobedience despite an earlier directive to Prof. Uwaleke to suspend any function or activity relating to his purported coronation. “In light of the foregoing, the Government is hereby directing Prof. Amaobi Uwaleke to forthwith comply with the earlier directive by suspending any activity relating to his purported coronation today. ” Failure to comply with this directive, the State Government shall not hesitate to use all legitimate means within the ambit of the law to ensure compliance”. Meanwhile, as at the time of this report, several attempts made to reach Professor Amaobi Uwaleke for his reaction over the ‘sledgehammer’ unleashed on him by Governor Emeka Ihedioha-led administration in Imo state was unfruitful.
