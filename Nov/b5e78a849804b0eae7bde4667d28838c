Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, was full of praise for Marcos Rojo, following their 3-0 win over Partizan Belgrade in the Europa League on Thursday night. Anthony Martial, Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford all scored, as United booked their place in the last 32 of the competition. Rojo made his eighth appearance of the season, alongside Harry Maguire in defence. The Argentinean had looked set to leave Old Trafford, but Solskjaer is delighted he stayed. “I thought he was excellent tonight. I think he’s been excellent since we started pre-season. “He’s played maybe more than he expected but that’s why he’s still here. “He’s a top-quality footballer. He’s a winner, good mentality, he can pass, he can defend. “It’s now about keeping him fit and he’s been fit now for a long, long time and you can see his qualities,” Solskjaer told BT Sport.
