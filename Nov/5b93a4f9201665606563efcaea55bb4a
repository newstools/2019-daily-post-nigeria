Chinalu Uwadione, told the court that the defendant committed the offences on Jan. 15, 2009, at Ojo area of Lagos. Uwadione said that the defendant collected N1 million from Chief Azubuike Ekwerekwu and N2 million from Mr Christopher Iloabanafo for legal services he failed to render. “The lawyer defrauded Ekwerekwu and Iloabanafo by collecting N3 million from them on the pretext that he would handle their cases,” the prosecutor said.
