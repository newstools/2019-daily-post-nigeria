Chelsea midfielder, Jorginho has revealed that Frank Lampard’s men are focused on finishing in the Premier League top-four this season and to secure a UEFA Champions League spot. According to Jorginho, Chelsea are not thinking about challenging Liverpool and Manchester City for the Premier League title despite being joint second in the table with 26 points after 12 games. “The first thing we need to think about is top four,” Jorginho told VBET News. “Then try to win every game. We need that for our mentality. “We are doing very well and we just have to keep going like this.” Jorginho will hope to lead Chelsea to victory when they take on Man City in the Premier League fixture at the Etihad Stadium this weekend.
