Head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr has hailed the attitude of his players after they came from behind to beat Benin Republic 2-1 in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, qualifier encounter on Wednesday. DAILY POST had reported that the Super Eagles had to fight from a goal down, as the Squirrels opened scoring at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo. Stephane Sessegnon latched on a defensive error to make it 1-0. Victor Osimhen made it 1-1 from the penalty spot, shortly before half time. Samuel Kalu grabbed the winner, with a fine solo goal. “Benin Republic are good team, we knew what they did in the Afcon but our attitude was good,” Rohr told reporters in his post-match press conference in Uyo. “I’m happy with the result, to come back and win. Good to see competitions among the players. “We are good everywhere in Nigeria, we had good hospitality in Asaba. But it feels good to be back in Uyo,” Rohr added. Nigeria will now take on Lesotho on Sunday in their next match. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
