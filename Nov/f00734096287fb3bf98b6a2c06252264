Manchester United goalkeeper, David De Gea has suggested that the Red Devils are struggling under manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer this season because of “lack of quality” in the squad. Solskjaer’s men have not been impressive so far this season. They are currently in ninth position on the Premier League table with 17 points from 13 matches. Man United were defeated 2-1 by Astana in the UEFA Europa League encounter on Thursday. Speaking ahead of Man United’s Premier League against Aston Villa, De Gea told Sky Sports: “The team is what it is, and the results are what they have been recently. “We need to win four or five games in a row to be at the top, but at the moment the team is not playing so well. “We’re giving it everything, we’re trying to get those big wins that can put us high up in the table, but the truth is at the moment we’re not consistent enough, there’s much to train and much to improve. “I don’t think it’s through any lack of effort, the boys are leaving everything out on the field in training and games. “You could point maybe to a lack of quality in certain areas, but certainly not a lack of fight.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
