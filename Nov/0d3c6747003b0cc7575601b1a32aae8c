Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, has issued new conditions to the Nigerian government, before he can have a dialogue over the agitation for Biafra. Kanu, in a statement signed by IPOB’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, said he was ready if the federal government will consider a referendum on self-determination for the Biafran people. He also insisted that the meeting should take place at a neutral venue and organized by the United Nations. “But even now, if a Nigerian government was willing to talk honestly and openly about our demands and to consider a referendum on self-determination for the Biafran people, in a neutral space provided by the United Nations, I would be there at the table. “Look around Africa today. There are some countries with a functioning democracy, where the rule of law is respected and free and fair elections allowed. But not Nigeria, our struggle for self-determination is the struggle of Africa’s post-colonisation from Algeria to the Cape. If we can achieve this, perhaps we can lead other African countries to bring democracy and respect for law and human rights into the lives of African peoples,” the statement read. Kanu explained that he wanted a neutral venue, because of the invasion of his home in Umuahia in 2017 by the Nigerian Army. “The men (soldiers) who came to my family home in September 2017 came to kill me. I do not doubt this. If they wanted to arrest me or question me, they would have sent the police or agents of the DSS. Why send soldiers trained to kill, if not to kill? I had wanted my day in court in 2017, but the military response tells me that the rule of law in Nigeria has collapsed. “The attack took its toll on my parents. My mother suffered heart complications as a result of the trauma and stress of the Nigerian army’s invasion of my house. She became very ill and died earlier this year. It would not be an overstatement to say that the primary cause of my mother’s death was Operation Python Dance 2. “I have lost a mother. My father, a strong man, a chief among Biafrans, has lost his life’s companion. Sadly, we have watched his health decline since the attack on our home and my mother’s death. “I mourn my mother. I mourn my entire IPOB family member who had given their lives to protect mine,” he added.
