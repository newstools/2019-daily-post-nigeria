Personal Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari, Bashir Ahmad, has hinted that the All Progressives Congress (APC) will claim Bayelsa and Kogi states. He tweeted this Saturday night. In Bayelsa, the main contenders are Senator Douye Diri, of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and David Lyon of the APC. In Kogi, incumbent Governor, Yahaya Bello of the APC is against PDP’s Engr. Wada. “We are winning Bayelsa!”, the presidential aide posted on Twitter. “And, we are winning Kogi!!!”, he later tweeted. Meanwhile, voting has ended and collation of votes is in progress. However, Gov Dickson of Bayelsa, and the party’s candidate, Sen. Diri, have complained of electoral fraud and widespread violence. Dickson made the allegation while speaking with newsmen shortly after casting his vote at Oruerewari, Polling Unit 005, Toru Orua in Sagbama Local Government Area. He called for outright cancellation of the elections in Nembe Local Government Area where 20 people were reportedly killed by gunmen at a PDP campaign rally. Dickson advised the Chairman of INEC to issue an order canceling the process in all the affected units, wards, local government areas, where election materials had been stolen or hijacked.
