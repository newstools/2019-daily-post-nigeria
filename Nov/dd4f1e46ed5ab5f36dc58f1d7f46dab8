Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger has insisted that Real Madrid ace, Eden Hazard no longer have the confidence he had at Chelsea. According to Wenger, Hazard’s weight gain is one of the reasons the 28-year-old forward has struggled at Santiago Bernabeu since joining Zinedine Zidane’s side from Chelsea some months ago. The Frenchman said this following Real Madrid’s 6-0 victory over Galatasaray in the Champions League on Wednesday night. Hazard was not on the score sheet for the Los Blancos as goals from Rodrygo (3), Sergio Ramos (1) and Karim Benzema (2) gave the home side all three points against the Turkish club. “I feel we have not seen the Hazard we’ve known in England yet,” Wenger told beIN Sports. “He was not physically fit after he was injured. Is he a little bit… he’s not a player usually impressed by anything, but he looked to me like he does not have the same confidence he had at Chelsea.” “He’s not the type of guy to be like that. I don’t know him well enough to assess that. But I think it was more down to physical reasons. “He came too heavy like we read in the papers. If you want to make a horse lose a race, putting two kilos on a horse of 500 kilos is enough.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
