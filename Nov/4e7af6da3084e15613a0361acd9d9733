A cleric and founder of God Miracle Success Ministry World Wide, Prophetess Oluwayemisi Sunday-Ajiye has advised the federal government to consider the suffering of Nigerians over the continuous closure of land borders in the country. The cleric stated this while speaking during the 2019 annual anniversary and Thanksgiving ceremony of the ministry in Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti state capital. Those who were at the ceremony include; Engr Olajide Borode, Elder Akinlolu Debo, Dr Fasoranti Ademola, Pastor Adedayo Folorunso, Pastor Adeyeye Sola and Engr Olajide Borode. She noted that the decision of the government since August was affecting businesses of many people in the country, adding that enabling environment must be provided for home-grown rice to be patronised. According to her, ” Government should always consider the plights of the downtrodden in the society when taken sensitive decisions. Our leaders should move closer to God for Him to direct them in governance. ” No doubt, the border closure has affected some persons in their businesses and I want to say again for government to consider the people. Also, we need more industries so as to help more people to be engaged.” The Prophet urged spiritual leaders to be more prayerful and work together in unity in the overall interest of the country, saying many people are looking up to the spiritual leaders for the turnaround of the country.
