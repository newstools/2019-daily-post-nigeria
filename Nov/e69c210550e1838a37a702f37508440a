Chelsea legend, Pat Nevin, has said that defender, Cesar Azpilicueta, was the player of the two-legged fixture against Ajax in the Champions League. The Blues beat Ajax 1-0 in Amsterdam and then played out a crazy 4-4 draw at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday evening. Azpilicueta helped sparked the stunning comeback against Ajax with the second Chelsea goal, and thought he had won the match when firing home another late goal. However, that was ruled out by VAR due to handball, with the points having to be shared in Group H. Nevin noted that Azpilicueta was the stand-out player for the Blues in the two matches. “I suppose it underlines just how well we had done against them over in Amsterdam,” Nevin was quoted by Football London. “Getting four points from six is magnificent in the circumstances. “I looked at this game in detail with Mario Melchiot and he was equally impressed with Chelsea against his other former side. “Now that the dust has settled, can we agree that Cesar Azpilicueta was the player of the tie? Considering all the talent on show, can it really be that our full-back was the top man? “Not only was he brilliant in Amsterdam from start to finish but he scored on Tuesday after being moved to left-back and but for the all-seeing eye of VAR, he would have hammered in the winner for 5-4. “He was also up against Ajax’s best player so he had his difficult moments, but he stuck to his task and gave at least as good as he got.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
