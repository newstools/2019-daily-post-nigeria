Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodgers, has denied that Jamie Vardy turned down a transfer to Arsenal, because he was worried about competition for places. Vardy came close to joining the Gunners in the summer of 2016, but eventually remained at the King Power, where he signed a new contract. The 32-year-old has scored eight goals in his last eight matches against Arsenal, including a brace in last season’s convincing 3-0 win, which damaged Arsenal’s chances of a top four finish. Victory for Leicester this Saturday will put them nine points clear of Arsenal in the race for the top four and Rodgers spoke about Vardy ahead of the game. “It won’t have been because of that, that he didn’t go to Arsenal,” Rodgers told reporters, when asked if Vardy was concerned at the prospect of fighting for a place in the Arsenal team. “The one thing I know from Jamie Vardy is he is a team player who loves competition. “He is a competitor, I see it everyday. He has proven himself to be one of the top strikers in Europe for me. “It was probably a number of things – he was offered a good deal here, felt comfortable, stable here with his family at an incredible club.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
