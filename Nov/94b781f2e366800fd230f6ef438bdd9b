Thousands of youths in Iwuru, Akamkpa local government area of Cross River State on Saturday, blocked the Calabar-Ikom highway protesting the alleged killing of their son. The incident occurred in the early hours of Saturday. An eyewitness who declined giving his name said that the incident occurred in a bad spot of the road in small Iwuru, when youths assisted in pulling out a vehicle from the bad spot. “After pulling out the vehicle, the boys demanded for gratification which the occupants of the vehicle refused to give. The boys did not know that the occupants of the vehicle were security operatives and they insisted on getting their money. “Misunderstanding ensued and the security operatives allegedly opened fire and one of the youths was gunned down from the stray bullet and he died on the spot. By the time the youths realised it, the vehicle had left. “Aggrieved by the incident, the youths destroyed several vehicles on site and also blocked the road for over seven hours,” he stated.

Hon Ogbor Ogbor said that he was informed about the incident and that he was currently on top of the situation to ensure that law and order was maintained.
