Argentina captain, Lionel Messi on Friday evening scored 13 minutes into his return for the Albiceleste against Brazil in an international friendly encounter in Saudia Arabia. Messi, who has not featured for Argentina since he was sent off in the third-place game against Chile at the 2019 Copa America in July, saw his penalty kick from 12 yards saved by Liverpool goalkeeper, Becker Alisson. The 32-year-old, however, reacted quickest to tuck away the rebound and give his team a 1-0 lead. Brazil had a penalty of their own before Messi’s opener when German Pezzella fouls Man City’s Gabriel Jesus inside the box after nine minutes. Jesus stepped up to take it but missed his spot kick as the ball rolled harmlessly wide of goal. The match eventually ended 1-0 after full-time in favour of Argentina.
