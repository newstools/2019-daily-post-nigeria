Argentina and Juventus forward, Paulo Dybala, has described Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as “monsters”, who are convinced they are the best player on the pitch in every game. Messi and Ronaldo are considered to be among the greatest players of all time, and have won a combined 10 Ballon d’Or awards. Dybala has played alongside Ronaldo at Serie A champions Juve and with Barcelona captain Messi for Argentina. “Outside the pitch, they are two very quiet people, but inside they are two monsters,” Dybala told Spanish newspaper, El Pais. “I heard Luis Scola [Argentinian basketball player] said both Leo and Cristiano enter the field convinced that they are the best and that is why they are the best. And I am sure that is so. “My friends used to tell me: ‘You have the best in the national team and now they bring you the best one at your club’. I replied: ‘It is an advantage for me.’ “I can study them every day. Who doesn’t want to play with the best? We are talking about two phenomenal players; two players who are one or two steps above the rest. “They are at the top on a football level and also at a mental level. It is not easy to keep going and score 40 goals every year. It is crazy. “In the history of football, great players have played at great teams and have not achieved what they did. They have been good for each other.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
