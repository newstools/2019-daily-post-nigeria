The lawmaker representing Abeokuta North, Odeda and Obafemi-Owode Federal Constituency, Hon. Olumide Osoba, said he would not say a word over trending allegations that he opened his constituency office in a place other than where he is representing at the House of Representatives. Allegations became rife on social media when Osoba, Saturday, reportedly opened his constituency office at Abiola Way, Leme, an area under Abeokuta South Federal Constituency, which is being represented by Hon. Lanre Edun. DAILY POST reports that Hon. Olumide is the biological son of a former Governor of Ogun State and Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Olusegun Osoba. There were reports that the building being used by the lawmaker for the new constituency office belongs to his father. The House of Representatives member came under heavy criticisms from his constituents and politicians, who are still querying the motive behind his action. “Hon Olumide Osoba represents Abeokuta North, Obafemi Owode and Odeda Federal Constituency. But why the choice of his father’s property in Abeokuta South as his constituency office? one Esther Lanpejo questioned. One Mr Lawal Gbenga said, “Some of our Lawmakers are clowns. A two-term House of Representatives member representing Abeokuta North, Odeda and Obafemi Owode Federal Constituency, Hon Olumide Babatunde Osoba, opened his Constituency office in Abeokuta South Federal Constituency. Honestly, this is funny.” When contacted by DAILY POST on Wednesday for his reactions on the location of his constituency office, Hon. Osoba listened attentively to the question posed to him, but declined comment, saying, “No comment. Have a good day,” He thereafter dropped the call.
