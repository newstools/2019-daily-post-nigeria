The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, for the November 16 election, Chief David Lyon, has reacted to nullification of the party’s primaries by a Federal High Court sitting in Yenagoa on Thursday. Lyon asked people of Bayelsa State and his supporters not to panic, saying he was still contesting the election. DAILY POST reported earlier on Thursday that the court declared that the APC has no governorship candidate in the November 16 election in the State. According to Lyon, the Court of Appeal has ordered all parties to return to the status quo. He called on the people of the State to come out on Saturday and vote massively for the APC. The APC guber candidate spoke through the Alternate Director General of the David Lyon and Degi Eremienyo Campaign Organization, Prof. Seyefa Brisibe. Lyon said, “Let me use this opportunity to let all Bayelsans and our teaming supporters know that there is no cause for alarm. Our candidates, Chief David Lyon and Bishop Degi Eremienyo are fully, squarely on the ballot. “This is because, we, as law abiding citizens, have done what is proper, judicious and procedural to see that that judgement does not stand. “I want to appeal to all Bayelsans in the remotest areas, which our next governor stands for, to come out enmass to vote the APC come November 16.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
