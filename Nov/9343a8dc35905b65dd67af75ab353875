Former President, Olusegun Obasanjo, on Sunday said if Jesus Christ were to be in Nigeria at a time like this, He would have complained about the way the nation is being governed by those in positions of authority. Obasanjo said this at the 64th annual national convention of the Foursquare Gospel Church held at the church campground on the Lagos -Ibadan Expressway, Ajebo, Ogun State. Speaking on the state of the nation, Obasanjo urged clerics not to keep quiet, but to always speak the truth to power. He charged Christians to be like Jesus and as well foster unity among themselves, saying that failure to do that might make them become preys to the enemies. “As Christians, we have to be like Christ as we are transformed into the likeness of Christ or little like Christ. “So, in all positions, situations and events, we should be guided. “If Christ was in this position, in this situation or in this event, what would He have done? “We have a lot to do in the situation we found ourselves in this country today. And make no mistake about it. If we don’t get together and stay together, we would be devoured and that, we should not take lightly. “For me, if Christ was in Nigeria today, He would not keep quiet. He would say it as it should be said. He would speak truth to power. He would have no fear and he would have no intimidation. “Children of God, you have a responsibility to do and say what Jesus Christ would have done and said if he was in Nigeria today,” Obasanjo maintained.
