Bayern Munich have decided against hiring Arsene Wenger as their next manager. The Bundesliga club discussed the potential of the former Arsenal manager taking over from Niko Kovac, but chose to pursue other options. It is understood that Wenger reached out to Bayern CEO, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, on Wednesday to discuss the position. The club confirmed the discussion to German outlet, Bild, saying: “Arsene Wenger called Karl-Heinz Rummenigge on Wednesday afternoon and signalled his fundamental interest in the position at Bayern. “FC Bayern highly value Arsene Wenger’s work at Arsenal, but he is not an option to become head coach at FC Bayern.” Bayern are looking for a short-term option until the end of the season, something Wenger is not keen on.
