Go here >> https://healthsolve.org/vision/ Why am I telling you this? As you may know, when we get older, we usually begin to experience problems with our eyes and our vision. This causes many people to need eye surgery so they have the best vision possible. Why? Because, usually after the age of 45, the lens in our eyes begin to harden due to natural causes. Our vision becomes cloudy and the lens itself turns brown, blocking off our field of vision. Hence, developing into glaucoma, cataract and the likes. In fact, there are over three hundred thousand eye surgeries performed, each year, in Nigeria alone …many of which, are performed by inexperienced doctors in less than perfect conditions.  This has led to some scary stories on how some of these operations have gone wrong for some patients. The thing is, those operation rooms are not even clean, much less sterile. And the environmental conditions are not controllable.

Did You Know? “The Big Drug Companies Are Cheating Everyone Who Is Trying To Regain Lost Sight!” They do this in two different ways. First of all, they try to keep us from finding out about safe, cheap ways to Reverse Glaucoma, cataracts, myopia and other eyes problems… without… going for surgery. The second way they cheat us is, they sell us millions and millions of naira’ worth of prescription Glasses/lens that are worthless. Not only that, many of these glasses are very dangerous, …and they create a sort of refractive errors to our optic nerves.  Why am I telling you this? Why am I telling you this? I will tell you. But first, let me share with you the heart broken words Dr. Patterson told me when I went for my second surgery in Canada. As he conducted a test in my eyes, he looked up from his instrument and said…  “Mr. Ken, I’m Afraid, It’s Official. You Are Legally Blind!”  His words were no surprise. My vision had been troublesome all my life and, during the last couple years, had gotten exponentially worse. One eye was nearsighted, one eye was Glaucoma, both had astigmatism, both were scarred from sloppy radial keratotomy surgery and both eyes had cataracts obstructing my vision. …You have acute optic neuritis,” my doctor said, “and I don’t know if you’ll get your vision back.” Those words fell heavily on my spirits. They were not comforting, nor were they reassuring. Until that moment, I had allowed myself to believe it was a diagnosis I could perhaps triumph over. Dr Patterson’s words, however, left me with little hope. But he was wrong because today I can see (without glasses)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        more than a rattle snake in the green forest of Ekpoma haunting for rats.
