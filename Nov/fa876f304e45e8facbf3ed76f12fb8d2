Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has expressed his surprise at Arsenal’s decision to sack manager Unai Emery. Emery was dismissed on Friday following Arsenal’s 2-1 defeat at home to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League on Thursday night. Freddie Ljungberg, who was already part of Emery’s first-team coaching staff, will manage the Gunners on an interim basis while the North London outfit look for a permanent replacement for the Spaniard. Lampard, speaking during his Friday press conference was quoted by Football London as saying: “I wouldn’t say inevitable, we have seen some surprises in the last few weeks. “It is a shame; it looked like he [Emery] gave everything in the role.” Also, reacting to Emery’s sack, Glasgow Rangers manager, Steven Gerrard said: “This is the world we are in, the brutal reality of management, it’s a results business, I am aware of that. “You never ever want to see managers lose their jobs; I think it is always sad to see, particularly from the outside. “It is what it is, that’s just the world we live in, but we choose to go into it, so I suppose we have got ourselves to blame really, haven’t we?” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
