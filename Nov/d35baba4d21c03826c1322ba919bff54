Femi Falana, activist lawyer has charged the Department of State Services, DSS, to release detained Omoyele Sowore, convener of RevolutionNow Movement and save Nigeria from ridicule. He said this while faulting DSS latest reason for holding Sowore in custody. DSS had yesterday declared its readiness to release Sowore to his sureties only. Falana, however, condemned the condition, saying the secret police had constituted itself into an appellate court over the Federal High Court for making such demand. A statement he personally signed and issued in Abuja, on Wednesday reads: “The SSS has now said that it is only appropriate that those who stood surety for Sowore present themselves and have him released to them. “With respect to Sowore, we wish to state without any fear of contradiction, that the SSS has apparently constituted itself into an appellate court over the Federal High Court. “For the avoidance of doubt, no condition was attached to the order of the court for the release of both detainees.” He insisted that the secret police was aggravating the felony of contempt of court by asking sureties, who had been verified by the trial court to report in its office for an illegal verification. Falana added, “On that occasion, the SSS never asked our sureties to report after they had been verified by the trial court. “I demand for nothing less for my clients under the current political dispensation which ought to be anchored on the rule of law.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
