Some leaders of the All Progressive Congress (APC) were at the residence of former President Goodluck Jonathan in Bayelsa on Sunday. On the delegation were Jigawa State Governor, Badaru Abubakar, Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Niger Delta Affairs, Ita Enang, among others. The APC chieftains made the stop hours after the governorship election in the state. It is still unclear if it was a courtesy or ‘Thank you visit’ as being suggested in some quarters. Jonathan reportedly fell out with Governor Seriake Dickson after the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) primaries that produced Senator Douye Diri. He was conspicuously absent at the candidates’s campaign grand finale. DAILY POST reports that the APC won Jonathan’s LGA, Ogbia, with a wide margin. On October 10, Jonathan and President Muhammadu Buhari held a closed-door meeting, at the Presidential Villa, a parley some analysts are linking to the governorship poll. Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated the APC candidate David Lyon, on his victory. Lyon won six Local Government Areas out of the eight in the state to defeat Diri, who won just two LGAs – Sagbama and Kolokuma/Opokuma.
