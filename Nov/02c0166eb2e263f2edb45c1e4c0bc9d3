Manchester City striker, Sergio Aguero, has revealed that Pep Guardiola’s side must continue learning in the UEFA Champions League in order to win the Europe top-flight trophy sooner than later. Aguero believes Man City, who have reached the quarter-final twice and semi-final once, are improving with each European campaign. The Man City’s record goal-scorer also admitted that the Champions League is the one major trophy he has not won with the club. “So far, it’s the one thing I haven’ won with City,” Aguero was quoted by Man City’s official website as saying ahead of the Citizens’ Champions League clash with Atalanta on Wednesday night. “We’ll keep up the fight. All of these years have been a learning experience and we intend to continue that this season. “City hadn’t been able to participate in Europe it for quite some time, and now we are able to be a challenge every season. “Each campaign, we acquire more experience. Of course, I’d be very happy to win the Champions League with City and I really hope it’s on the cards.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
