The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints has urged the Federal Government to reconsider its decision on temporary closure of the nation’s land borders. President Muhammadu Buhari on November 1 approved the extension of the operation code-named Exercise Swift Response. Asuquo Udobong, the Agege Stake President of the church, said on Sunday that the border closure should not be used to inflict pains but should focus on ways of improving the welfare of Nigerians. “Every government has a policy it wants to pursue that will help in the process of reprogramming or restructuring the economy”, NAN quoted him as saying. “The Federal Government should always think of putting the welfare of the citizens into consideration. “Government should also ensure that while implementing policies, the masses should be the main focus. “If closing of borders will help to strengthen our economy, as a church, we will obey the laws of the land, but it should be done in a way that will not impose further hardship on the citizens,” Udobong said. In his remarks, Elder Marcus Nash, the West Africa Area President of the church, called for love amongst Nigerians to overcome the nation’s insecurity challenges and other vices.
