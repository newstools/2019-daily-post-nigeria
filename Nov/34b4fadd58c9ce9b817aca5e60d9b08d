Rt. Hon. Alhassan Ado Doguwa, former House Leader, House of Representatives, has refuted claim that he received 3 official cars from the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila. Hassan Inuwa, his spokesman, in a statement on Tuesday, said no principal officer, serving or non-serving, was allocated any vehicle yet by the House. “To say that the former member collected official vehicles during this transition period was out of place, derogatory, and wild machinations from political opponents to smear his name,” it said. “That as a law-abiding citizen, Hon. Alhassan would never indulge himself in any action that could undermine the honour and esteem of the House as well as the sanctity of the rule of law. “That it is a fact that Hon. Alhassan Doguwa enjoys a tremendous respect and good rapport with his honourable colleagues, the Speaker, leadership of the house, and the media, and he wishes that to remain intact. “Whilst he prays that the rerun election would, inshaa Allah, prove him victorious again, the former House leader calls on political actors to desist from making actions that could unnecessarily overheat the polity.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
