Juventus right-back, Danilo says fellow teammate, Cristiano Ronaldo told him that Brazil would have won five more FIFA World Cups if he had been in the Seleçao. Danilo, who also played alongside Ronaldo during their time at Real Madrid, made the revelation when speaking to DAZN Brazil. “I knew him from our time at Real Madrid and it was nice to be back with him at Juve,” Danilo said. “Along with his great quality, Ronaldo has this attention for detail that really explains the results he has achieved. “He even told me that, if he had played for Brazil, we would’ve won another five World Cups already.” Ronaldo, a five-time Ballon D’ Or winner, has been impressive for both club and country so far this season. The 34-year-old is among the 30-man shortlist for this year’s Europe top individual prize alongside Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk.
