The immediate past governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose has condemned the attack by gunmen on the hotel hosting Governor of Oyo State, Mr Seyi Makinde, ahead of elections in Kogi State. DAILY POST confirmed that some gunmen arrived the Suitorial Hotels, Lokoja, along Stadium Road, where the Governor and some members of the PDP Campaign Council were lodged at about 12.50 p.m., shooting sporadically. It was gathered that the hoodlums scaled the fence of the hotel and attempted to gain entrance into the main hotel. But a number of security operatives attached to the Governor and some residents of nearby buildings, however, worked with security operatives, to stop the invaders. Reacting, Fayose called on Nigerians to blame Yahaya Bello if anything happens to anyone during the Kogi governorship election on Saturday. The former governor said the attacks in the state few days to the election shows that ‘Yahaya Bello is averse to free and fair election’ Fayose on his Twitter page wrote: “From the persistent attack on Natasha Akpoti and today’s use of masked policemen to attack Gov. Seyi Makinde, it is obvious that Gov Yahaya Bello is averse to free and fair elections. “Should anything happen to anyone in Kogi tomorrow, Nigerians should hold Yahaya Bello accountable.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
