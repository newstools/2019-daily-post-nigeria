Real Madrid ace, Eden Hazard has backed Frank Lampard’s Chelsea to beat Manchester City when both sides clash in the Premier League on Saturday at the Etihad. Hazard, a former Chelsea star, believes the Blues’ young side are capable of pulling off an upset against Pep Guardiola’s side. Chelsea head to the game following a 2-0 victory over Crystal Palace in their last fixture, while Man City were defeated 3-1 by Liverpool. “Of course, I think Chelsea can beat Man City on Saturday,” Hazard told Sky Sports. “It’s not going to be easy. It’s hard to play there. Last time we played them we lost 6-0, so bad memories for me and for Chelsea as well. “But I think this season they are really good. They are really young, but they are really good, so why not go there and win the game? “When I watch them, no Hazard but it’s a party! They can score, they score a lot of goals, the fans are happy, and they are third in the league, so it’s going to be a great season. They just need to stay there, win games and that’s it.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
