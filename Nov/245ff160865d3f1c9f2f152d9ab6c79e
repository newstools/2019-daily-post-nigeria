There had been controversy over the young players’ eligibility for Nigeria considering his citizenship of three countries. DAILY POST had reported that Tomori’ was born in Canada by Nigerian parents and now lives in England. His peculiar position leaves now him the right to play for Nigeria, where his parents are from, Canada, where he was born and England where he currently lives. Recall that the 21-year-old was overlooked for England’s two Euro 2020 qualifying matches against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria last month after he was invited.  He was again overlooked for England’s Euro 2020 qualifying victory against Montenegro on Thursday night. Although he was invited alongside club teammate, Tammy Abraham, the centre-back was an unused substitute in the game against Montenegro. Tomori would have become cap-tied like Abraham, if he had been summoned from the bench against the visitors. But England manager, Gareth Southgate opted for Joe Gomez, James Maddison and Tammy Abraham, as the Three Lions thrashed Montenegro 7-0 at Wembley Stadium to book their spots at next year’s European Championships.
