The Peoples Democratic Party in Edo State has said that the exit of its former governorship aspirant in the State, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu from the party would not affect its fortunes. It said the party remains intact and that Pastor Ize-Iyamu had not officially informed the party hierarchy of his decision to dump the main opposition party. State Chairman of the PDP, Chief Dan Orbih, told reporters in Benin City on Wednesday that the party leadership just ended a meeting where decisions were taken on how the party would carry out mass mobilisation of the people for next year’s governorship election. Chief Orbih also denied allegations of agreeing to collect N6 billion from Governor Godwin Obaseki to join the PDP, adding that the party does not collect money from those willing to join. Orbih described the Edo APC as a disorganized party that lacked the structurè to manage issues for the benefit of the people. He said the PDP was poised to kick the APC out of power in the state. His words, “Few years ago when Pastor Ize-Iyamu first left the ACN for the PDP, he said he was coming home. Now that he is going to the APC, he said he is going back home. Is it that he is homeless? “We are not aware of his leaving. He has not officially informed us. The Edo PDP is intact. The departure of one man will not affect us.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
