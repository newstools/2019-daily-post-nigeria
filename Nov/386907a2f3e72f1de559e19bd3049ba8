The Rev John Pofi Foundation and some communities in Bayelsa State, have warned the Nigerian military personnel against turning communities into war zones, following an intelligence that the security agency was being mobilised to disrupt collation process. The foundation warned that the military personnel in large numbers and stationed at Aridof Hotels, the political base of All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Minister of State for Petroleum, Chief Timipriye Silva, is currently experiencing unusual large presence of military officers. The military personnel were allegedly drafted to the communities by the APC stalwart and the Governorship candidate, David Lyon, on the suspicion to be used to disrupt the collation of election results. “They are allegedly camped in a location within the communities in preparation for disruption of results”, said Mr. Owie Luke one of the indigenes of Bayelsa. Rev. John Pofi of Reverend John Pofi Foundation, expressed great worries that the development would spell great dangers to the state. “Why are these soldiers in Bayelsa? What are these large number of soldiers doing here which are even more than during the general elections. “Nigerians must cry out today and condemn the attempt by the military to repeat the mayhem and bloodbath they caused in Buguma, Rivers State, during the last general elections,” Rev. Pofi lamented. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
