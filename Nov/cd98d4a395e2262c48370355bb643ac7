In a post on his Twitter page, Banky W said he plans to do at least one album in the coming year. He said this while responding to a tweet from a fan who talked about how much he misses Banky W the singer and clamored for some more music. Banky W in response wrote: “Okay, I’m gonna do at least one more album, in 2020. “Not sure if there are too many ppl who feel the same as you do, but thanks for this. I appreciate it.” DAILY POST reports that Banky W released his last single ‘Mi Re Do (Cocoloso) Feat. Stonebwoy and Shaydee’ sometime in 2016. In 2017, the singer also released EP, Songs About U.
