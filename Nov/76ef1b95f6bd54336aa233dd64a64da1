The Seme Command of Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), on Wednesday has reacted to reports making the rounds of customs officers collecting bribes at borders. The Customs Spokesman in Seme, Abdullahi Hussaini, said in a statement described as baseless and unfounded reports on social media alleging that officers were collecting money in order to allow passage of fairly-used vehicles into the country despite the border drill. He urged members of the public with tangible evidence that could assist the Command to tackle any recalcitrant to come forward for the benefit of all. Hussaini also advised social media users to do proper investigation before making such serious allegations in order not to dampen the morale of officers in the discharge of their duties, NAN reports. He said NCS has introduced palliatives to help those whose vehicles were impounded or without duty and were willing to pay duty to approach the nearest Federal Operations Unit to the pay their duty.
