Manchester City will be without four key players: Bernado Silva, Leroy Sane, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Aymeric Laporte when they face a high flying Chelsea side after the international break. Manchester City’s first game following the November international break is a big one against Frank Lampard’s side. The reigning Premier League champions Manchester City face the Blues at the Eithad Stadium and Chelsea can move four points clear of Pep Guardiola’s side with victory in the day’s late kick-off. City boss, Pep Guardiola has somewhat of a selection dilemma on his hands ahead of the game. Silva is to serve a one-game suspension in relation to social media message about teammate Benjamin Mendy. Silva was charged by the Football Association last month after he compared Mendy to the character on a packet of Conguitos – a sweet brand available in Spain and Portugal. He has also been fined £50,000 for the tweet and will only sit out the clash against Lampard’s side. A statement via the FA’s official website reads, “Bernardo Silva has been suspended for one first team competitive fixture, fined £50,000 and must complete face-to-face education after admitting a breach of FA Rule E3. “The Manchester City midfielder’s social media activity on 22 September 2019 breached FA Rule E3(1), as it was insulting and/or improper and/or brought the game into disrepute, and constituted an “Aggravated Breach”, which is defined in FA Rule E3(2), as it included reference, whether expressed or implied, to race and/or colour and/or ethnic origin.” Sane suffered a serious knee injury in the Community Shield win over Liverpool back in August and is not expected to play again this year. The same goes for defender Laporte while Zinchenko could return later in the year.
