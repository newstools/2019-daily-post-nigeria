Liverpool boss, Juergen Klopp has identified Manchester City coach, Pep Guardiola as his best manager in the world. Klopp said this ahead of Liverpool’s Premier League clash against Guardiola’s men on Sunday at Anfield. “We constantly get asked questions and sometimes we say what is in that second in our mind without thinking about anything else, that we are in public, that there is a camera,” Klopp told Sky Sports. “I couldn’t have more respect for Pep Guardiola, that’s how it is. I’ve known him for so long, for me it’s a big thing to be his contender. “For me he’s the best manager in the world and we have the chance to win against his team which is very difficult but possible. That’s enough for me.” The kick-off time for the match is 5:30pm. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
