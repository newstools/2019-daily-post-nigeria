A Federal High Court, sitting in Ilorin, capital of Kwara State, Monday sentenced Abdullahi Ibrahim and Ezedigboo Paschal to four months imprisonment respectively without an option of fine for internet fraud. DAILY POST gathered that the convicts were arrested in Agric Estate, Ilorin sometime in February this year by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission ( EFCC), Ilorin Zonal Office, which separately prosecuted them on a one-count charge of fraud. EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren said this in a statement in Abuja. The charge against Ezedigboo reads: “That you, Ezedigboo Paschal(allas Frank Pethron or Frank Peth), sometime in January , 2019, at Ilorin, within the judicial division of this honourable court, with intent to defraud, falsely represented yourself to be one Frank Pethron or Frank Peth a white male Caucasian, vide Google account with email address: frankpeth009@gmail.com and thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under Section 484 of the Criminal Code Act.” That of Ibrahim reads: “That you, Abdullahi Ibrahim (alias Dennis Franklin), sometime in March, 2019, at Ilorin, within the judicial division of this honourable court, with intent to defraud one Kristie Johnson and others from the United State of American, falsely represented yourself, thereby committing an offence contrary to and punishable under Section 484 of the Criminal Code Act.” However, the defendants pleaded guilty to the charges before presiding Justice Babangana Ashigar. It was on this premise that the prosecuting counsel, Andrew Akoja urged the court to convict and sentence them in accordance with the plea bargain agreements they separately reached with the prosecution. In his ruling, Justice Ashigar sentenced the duo to four months imprisonment without an option of fine.
