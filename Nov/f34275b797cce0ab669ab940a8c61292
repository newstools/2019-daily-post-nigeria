Manchester City playmaker, Kevin De Bruyne has reacted to his side’s 2-1 victory over Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday. Two goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez gave Pep Guardiola’s men all three points against Chelsea. However, N’Golo Kante scored a goal for Frank Lampard’s men at the Etihad Stadium. “We had a couple of chances at the beginning and didn’t hit the target,” De Bruyne told Sky Sports. “They scored but then we reacted with two quick goals. In the second half, we kept it tight — they might have had more of the ball but we created the better chances. “We don’t care what happens to other teams — Liverpool, Leicester, Chelsea — we have to keep running. We know after the last two years the hard work we have to put in.” Also, reacting to Man City’s win over Chelsea, Riyad Mahrez said: “It was a difficult game but we reacted very well after we conceded the first goal. This type of game,it’s most important to get three points. We’re not going to play very good all the time.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
