Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has insisted that he is happy with goalkeeper, Kepa Arrizabalaga, despite a number of incidents where he feels the Spain international could have done better this term for the Blues. He also gave the latest injury update on defender, Antonio Rudiger. Speaking at his pre-match press conference on Friday ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash with West Ham United on Saturday evening, Lampard was quoted by Football London as saying: “I’m happy. Like everybody, we’re all trying to improve. “Kepa is a professional, and you can see it in his attitude everyday. He’s a keeper that’s striving to be better, as he should do at his age and the status he has – Chelsea’s No.1, big price tag, Spain’s No.1 and competing with another great goalkeeper (De Gea). “He’ll want to get better all the time, and there have been a few incidents this season where he’ll be the first to say he can do better. That’s football at the top level, but I’m happy with him and with his work ethic.” Lampard added: “Rudiger is getting closer, he has had a really good week’s work by the realisation and the reality is that he has not played for a very long time. “It’s a mini pre-season now that the injury seems to be hopefully finished and over. Now we need to get him fit and he is working very, very hard to make sure of that. It is days and weeks, rather than months which is great news for us.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
