Following the kidnap of a one-year-old boy at a popular church in Akure, the Ondo State capital, family of the missing child has accused the founder of the church, Prophet Babatunde Alfa of using police to harass everyone. According to the mother of the missing boy, Mrs. Modupe Kolawole, the paternal grandmother of the boy, Mrs. Kemisola Kolawole has been arrested and detained by the police Anti-kidnapping Squad. She stated that her mother-in-law was arrested following a peaceful protest at the church premises by family members, friends and sympathizers. Recall that DAILY POST had reported how the boy, Gold Kolawola was kidnapped at the popular church, Sotitobire Miracle Centre after his mother took him to the church’s children department. Since the incident happened, the family has been pointing accusing finger at Prophet Alfa for allegedly being behind the mysterious disappearance of the boy. .
The boy’s mother, Modupe said nobody had been invited within the church by the police since the incident occurred. She also stated that the family’s lawyer had already written a petition to the State Commissioner of Police to intervene in the matter. “It is unfortunate that police that is supposed to be protecting citizens, is being used to harass citizens. My mother in-law has been detained since Tuesday till now, they don’t allow us to see her since.” Meanwhile, Prophet Alfa has continued to ignore calls made to his phone as well as messages sent since the incident occurred.
