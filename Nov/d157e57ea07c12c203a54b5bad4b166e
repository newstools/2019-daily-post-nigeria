Kinsmen of former President Goodluck Jonathan in Kolo, Ogbia Local Government Area, of Bayelsa State, on Saturday trooped out to celebrate the defeat of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ward 9. The ex-President’s kinsmen took over the road leading to Ogbia town immediately the results of the 13 units in Ward 9 were announced by officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, officials and APC was declared the winner of the ward. Some of them flew the flag of APC while others used their brooms to sweep the road, saying they had suffered under the current PDP government. Some of them said they were given as much as N10,000 but rejected the money because they were united and determined to vote out PDP. “We are happy because we won the PDP in all the units,” one of them, who failed to mentioned his name out of excitement said. Also in Eppie-Atissa in Yenagoa, residents took over the road jubilating over the defeat of the PDP in the area.
