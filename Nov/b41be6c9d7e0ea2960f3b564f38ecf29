The federal government has reacted to fears over the Third Mainland Bridge in Lagos. Government assured motorists of safety and advised users not to be scared. The Federal Controller for Works, Lagos, Adedamola Kuti, spoke to newsmen on Tuesday in reaction to a new video about the bridge. “We have just been informed that part of the third mainland bridge has opened up and the bridge is shaking. “This is an old video. The bridge is not designed to be static. Expansion joints are not structural elements. We are very mindful of public safety. “However, this worn-out expansion joint will be replaced soon. All materials for the replacement of worn-out expansion joints on Third Mainland Bridge are already in the country. “As soon as I get our traffic management plan approved, work would commence. Kindly disregard all rumours going round,” he said. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
