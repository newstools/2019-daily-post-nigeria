Nigeria will begin their quest to be at the next Africa Cup of Nations in 2021, when they take on Benin Republic on Wednesday, in their qualifying fixture. The Super Eagles, who have won the AFCON three times in the past, finished in third place in this year’s competition. Gernot Rohr’s men go into the match against their West African neighbours in fine form, having held Ukraine and Brazil to credible draws in recent friendly matches. The game will be played at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom state capital. Kick off is 5pm Nigerian time. Supersport 3 and 9 are expected to beam the encounter live, with analysis beginning half an hour before.
