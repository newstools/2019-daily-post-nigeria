The Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami, has explained that the major reason the ministry was renamed was to make Nigeria “a force in Information and Communication Technology (ICT)”. He spoke in Abuja, weekend, at the 2019 Annual General Meeting (AGM) and Conference of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR). Pantami pointed out that with an effective ICT industry, Nigeria stands to become the hub of digitalization in Africa in not too distant future. The minister, in his speech, however stressed that effective, purposeful and service-oriented leadership is key to fast-tracking speedy and enduring socio-economic development. Pantami said: “Today in Nigeria, we look at things from sentimental perspectives. Sentiment is one of the reasons people do not regard competence in leadership roles. “Rather, they consider personal interests, geographical locations, religion, tribe or ethnicity, which are not the fundamental criteria at any point in time.” FCT Minister, Musa Bello, represented by his Chief of Staff, Bashir, Mai Borno, noted that once leadership deficit was solved, most of the problems bedeviling the nation would defeated. “There is a need for us to re-engineer the process of good, dedicated and exemplary leadership in the country’, he said.
