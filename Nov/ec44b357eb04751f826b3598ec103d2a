Tottenham manager, Jose Mourinho has ruled out the possibility of signing former Manchester United and LA Galaxy striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Mourinho said that Spurs will not sign Ibrahimovic because they already have a ‘top striker’, Harry Kane. Ibrahimovic was linked with a move to join Mourinho at Tottenham after he mutually parted ways with LA Galaxy following a two-year stint with the MLS club some few days ago. The 38-year-old played under Mourinho at Manchester United, winning the Europa League and EFL Cup before he left Old Trafford in 2018 for LA Galaxy. Speaking ahead of Tottenham’s UEFA Champions League clash against Olympiacos on Tuesday, Mourinho was quoted by Sky Sports as saying: “I would say we have one of the top strikers in England. “It doesn’t make any sense of a striker of Zlatan’s dimension to come to a club where we have Harry Kane.” He added: “I love this competition as much as everyone in football. “It’s something that everybody dreams of winning. Not everyone has the privilege of being a Champions League winner which I was happy enough to do.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
