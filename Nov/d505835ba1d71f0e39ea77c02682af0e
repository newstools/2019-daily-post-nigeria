The House of Representatives, Thursday resolved to probe International oil companies over alleged Labour Law violation. It also urged Minister of Labour, Employment and Productivity and other appropriate ministries, Departments and Agencies to address the challenges of exploitation and abuses of workers in the oil and gas sector. This development followed an adopted motion sponsored by Hon. Benjamin Okezie Kalu. In his lead debate, Kalu recalled that Nigeria, as a member of the International Labour Organisation, ILO, has ratified 40 International Labour conventions and has through the National Assembly enacted the labour Act,among other Labour related laws through which Nigeria is sworn to protecting the rights of workers in the country. The lawmaker also flayed the trend of work casualisation in the oil and gas sector by the international oil companies which he argued led to an uncertainty of employment for thousands of workers. Besides, Kalu posited that the inhuman situation has brought about precarious conditions with denial of benefits associated with permanent and decent work. In their contributions, many lawmakers upheld the motion in its entirety and voted for investigation. It was on this premise that Speaker of the house, Femi Gbajabiamila firmed up the majority resolution with a gavel and directed committee on Labour, Employment and Productivity to probe the contentious conditions and report back within two weeks for further legislative actions.
