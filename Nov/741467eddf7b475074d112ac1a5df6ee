Lille striker, Victor Osimhen, has admitted that their last Champions League group fixture against Chelsea, will be difficult. Whether they win or lose at Stamford Bridge on December 10, Lille have already been eliminated from the competition, as they trail the third placed team in Group H by seven points. Osimhen was on the losing side, as Ajax won 2-0 at Stade Pierre Mauroy-Villeneuve d’Ascq. Speaking after yesterday’s game, the Super Eagles frontman told reporters: “It was devastating to concede such an early goal. But we had chances, we could have led 2-1. “I’m always positive in what I think and do, so we’ll go to Chelsea to play our game. “We are playing against one of the best teams in the world, and we know it’ll be tough. But our best performance so far came against Chelsea here.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
