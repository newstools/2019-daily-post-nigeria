The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has reacted to the disqualification of a governorship candidate, David Lyon of the All Progressives Congress, APC. DAILY POST reports that a High Court on Thursday, presided over by Justice Jane Inyang ruled in a case filed by Heineken Lokpobiri, one of the APC governorship aspirants. A former Minister of State for Agriculture, Lokpobiri, had approached the court, seeking a declaration, that he, and not David Lyon, is the authentic candidate of the APC. The court on Thursday, pronounced that “the governorship primary conducted by the APC in Bayelsa state was not done in compliance with the guidelines and the constitution of the party, and, therefore, the party has no candidate.” INEC’s National Commissioner and Chairman of Information and Voter Education Committee, Mr. Festus Okoye, reacting said the commission will obey the court judgement. Okoye added that Bayelsa election will not be stopped despite many court pronouncements. Speaking to the Nation, Okoye said: “All electoral materials had been deployed. “The Saturday election in Bayelsa will go on as planned despite court ruling disqualifying APC candidate, David Lyon.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
