Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard has said that Tammy Abraham’s injury in Chelsea’s 2-2 draw with Valencia in the Champions League last night may not be too serious. Abraham landed awkwardly on Valencia’s Ezequiel Garay at the end of the first half and was in obvious pain as he limped off the pitch. The England international had to be taken off on a stretcher at the Mestalla but while initial reports suggested he had gone to hospital, Lampard said he was not sure about that. Asked if Abraham was taken to the hospital, Lampard told BT Sport, “I’m not sure if that’s true but he’s in the dressing room now. “The word at half-time was it looked quite severe, a bang on the hip. “Then the word after the game was it might not be as severe as we first thought.” Abraham was on the ground for a lengthy period as he received treatment following the incident, before gingerly getting to his feet. But he struggled to walk off the pitch and eventually Chelsea’s medical staff had to call for a stretcher with the youngster in agony. Former Chelsea star, Joe Cole added, “That’s a sore one. He’s in a lot of pain. “Tammy is not the type of lad, it will take a big incident for him not to play, he loves playing football.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
