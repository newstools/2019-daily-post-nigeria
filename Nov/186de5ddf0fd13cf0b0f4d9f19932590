President Muhammadu Buhari has revealed that his government was disturbed by the strikes in the education sector. “Government is fully aware of the challenges in the university and will continue to do its best to address them,” he said. NAN reports that Buhari stated this in Ibadan on Monday at the Foundation Day and Convocation ceremonies of the University of Ibadan. He, however, urged labour unions in the universities to be sensitive to the effects of industrial actions. The president, who is the Visitor to the university, was represented at the event by Prof Abubakar Rasheed, the Executive Secretary, National Universities Commission (NUC). “One of the cardinal objectives of education in any country is nation building, especially in the 21st century where knowledge is the key determinant of growth and development of nations,” the president said. He enjoined the graduands to explore the enormous knowledge gained from the university to ensure the country’s socio-economic development. “It is our hope that these graduating students will turn out to be worthy ambassadors of this university wherever they find themselves. “The various speeches delivered today have highlighted the challenges and limitations of the universities and the nation at large. “Since the inception of my administration, we have made appreciable contributions to education, and we will not relent in improving education to fast track Nigeria’s transition to a knowledge-based society,” he said.
