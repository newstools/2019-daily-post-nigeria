Minister of Women Affairs, Mrs Pauline Tallen, yesterday visited the New Foundation School (NFS), Yola, Adamawa State. She made the trip in company of the outgoing Miss Nigeria, Chidinma Aaron. The NFS located inside the premises of the American University of Nigeria (AUN) is a special education facility for the rescued students of Chibok following the April 2014 Boko Haram abduction incident. The minister commended the girls for their courage and resilience, adding that as their, “mother” she would continue to be there for them, anytime. She explained that her visit was to hear from them, get an update about their welfare and know the progress of their academic and other trainings. “The Federal Government would continue to take care of their needs as well as provide necessary materials for development”, Tallen said. In her remarks, Aaron stressed the need for young women to continue to maintain their dignity and esteem. “It was a great moment for me, seeing those strong women who in the past went through horrible experiences. They are real women, confident and ready to face the future,” the beauty queen said. Meanwhile, the 2019 Miss Nigeria pageant holds this weekend. The annual event began as a photo show in 1957. Grace Oyelude won the maiden edition that year. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
