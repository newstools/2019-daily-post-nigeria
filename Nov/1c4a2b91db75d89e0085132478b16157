The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Prince Uche Secondus on Tuesday called on the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to “act quickly” on the Abuja High Court ruling which disqualified the Deputy Governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Bayelsa State, Bishop Degi by invoking the relevant sections of the constitution and the Electoral Act. Prince Secondus said that a gubernatorial candidate without a “deputy cannot stand on one leg and walking into an election and should be quickly disqualified.” The PDP Chairman stated this in a statement signed by his Media Aide, Ike Abonyi and sent to DAILY POST. According to the statement, Secondus said the court ruling “means that APC has no validly nominated candidate for the November 16 governorship election as the law requirement on this is clear.” He urged the INEC to do the needful by “disqualifying APC candidate in the race as he cannot stand alone nor replace at this time.” “What is happening with APC in Bayelsa obtains when desperadoes chase power without any clear vision and love to serve the people,’ he added. He also took a swipe at the attitude of the military in the two states of Kogi and Bayelsa States ahead of the November 16 elections. The PDP National Chairman said the image of the country before the global democracies was being damaged by the military. He advised the military to stay away and not do anything that will further endanger the reputation of the nation’s military. “You are supposed to be apolitical and neutral established to protect the country and its citizens all the time and not government in power at a time,” he said.
