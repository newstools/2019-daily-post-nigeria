Chelsea forward, Callum Hudson-Odoi could leave Stamford Bridge to join Zinedine Zidane’s Real Madrid next summer. DAILY POST had reported that Hudson-Odoi refused to sign a new five-year deal with the club last December and almost left for Bayern Munich last January this year. The player also said that he will sign his new contract with the club on the condition that the Blues will give him assurances of playing time. However, El Desmarque is now reporting that Real Madrid have joined the race to sign Hudson-Odoi at the end of this season in a bid to bolster their attack line. The newspaper reports that the Los Blancos president, Florentino Perez is closely monitoring the 19-year-old, as well as several other youngsters, Everton’s Moise Kean, Villarreal’s Samuel Chukweze and RB Salzburg’s Erling Braut Haaland.
