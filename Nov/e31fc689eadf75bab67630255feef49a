Kogi State Deputy Governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Khalid Adams, has described the attack on the party’s State Secretariat early Monday morning in Lokoja as “coward’s alternative.” Reacting to the development on Monday, he said that the attack was not only despicable, but a coward’s alternative by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), which has lost the peoples goodwill as a result of bad governance. He said that the party has failed to stop their gubernatorial bid as eminent citizens of Kogi State through surreptitious approach, but has now resorted to crude attack on SDP properties and supporters. He said: “The APC thugs shattered the properties and destroyed windows and louvers on Sunday night and pasted APC governorship posters all over the places. “That wasn’t satisfactory to them, early this morning, they came and razed the party’s secretariat because Natasha Akpoti is contesting election against the State Governor. “Why is APC intimidated? Why are they afraid of SDP? “They tried to stop us through surreptitious means and it didn’t work. We got judgement from a Federal High Court in Abuja last Thursday which has reinforced our faith, but APC has been jittery and are unleashing violence on the party.” The deputy governorship candidate ruled out any setback as a result of Court judgement in favour of the party few days to the election, saying that the party was ready to face the election. He called on the State Commissioner of Police and other security agencies to fish out the perpetrators, adding that himself and Natasha Akpoti have been earmarked for attack by thugs loyal to the ruling All Progressives Congress in Kogi State.
