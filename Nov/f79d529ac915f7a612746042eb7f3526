Chelsea chairman, Bruce Buck, has revealed that the club owner, Roman Abramovich, will not entertain “bargain bids”. Abramovich had issues renewing his British visa last year and has not been seen at home games this season. The Russian billionaire also cancelled plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge. It has been speculated that Abramovich is looking to sell the club, after taking Israeli citizenship in May last year. “I have never heard a word from Abramovich: ‘Let’s get this ready for a sale,’ or something,” Buck told the UK Guardian. “Because of the political situation, there are people who think they might want to buy Chelsea at a bargain. We do get inquiries and we really have nothing to say to these people. “In terms of being involved, in looking at new players, talking about whether to extend players’ contracts… [he] was always intimately involved in that from day one and is just as intimately involved now.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
