Barcelona manager,Ernesto Valverde, still retains the support of the board, although there are concerns about how the team is playing, ESPN reports. The LaLiga champions have endured their worst start to a league campaign in 25 years, failing to win any of their first three away games. Valverde’s men were defeat 3-1 by Levante last Saturday and played out a 0-0 draw with Slavia Prague in the Champions League on Tueday. Barca president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, is not ready to fire Valverde just yet, but it is understood that if the poor results continue, he may change his mind. There were calls for Valverde to be sacked at the end of last season, following losses to Liverpool and Valencia in the Champions League and Copa del Rey. Bartomeu instead handed him a contract renewal until 2021 in February. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
