Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has spoken out on the conversation he had with Bayern Munich’s hierarchy this week. Wenger is one of the names linked with the Bundesliga champions, after they sacked Niko Kovac. “On Wednesday afternoon, [Karl-Heinz] Rummenigge called me. “I could not answer at that moment and out of politeness I called him back. He was in his car to the game against Olympiacos. “We talked for four to five minutes maximum and he told me that they’ve signed [Hans-Dieter] Flik to be the coach. “He will manage the next two games, because they play Borussia Dortmund tomorrow [on Saturday]. “He asked me if I’d be interested because they are looking for a coach, I told him I didn’t have any thoughts about it. It needs some time to think about. “We decided together we will talk next week, because I’m in Doha until Sunday night. This is the true story. “I wish well to Bayern, which is actually at a turning point because [Uli] Hoeness, a key man for this club, is leaving. “Rummenigge will leave in one year, it seems the future is uncertain. “And this club which has always managed stuff by being very discreet and direct is today very exposed with rumours coming from everywhere. “For myself, I wish good luck to Bayern and for me the situation is clear,” Wenger told beIN Sports.
