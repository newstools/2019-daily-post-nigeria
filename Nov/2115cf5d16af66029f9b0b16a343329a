Police in Benin City on Tuesday evening, repelled an attempt by armed robbers to attack the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Benin branch. The ugly incident, which happened at King Square (the city center), saw the attempt by the robbery gang trying to break into the bank when a bullion van carrying cash to an unknown commercial bank was about leaving the CBN premises. The hoodlums were, however, repelled by the armed police security team attached to the bank. The exchange of gunfire between the bank security and the robbers that lasted few minutes forced the robbers to retreat and escaped, while people and motorists around scampered for safety. An eyewitness told DAILY POST that luck ran out of the robbers who may have been prepared for the worse. “Bros, the robbers were ready for anything but the police also showed them that they were super ready for them. “You can see how unusual the environment is for now, this whole place was locked down, traffic was heavy here due to the attack. How can robbers come to this place, the centre of our capital city, place like Ring Road. I think the state government has to do something about the security of this state, especially now that Xmas is around the corner, thank God that no casualty was recorded in gun duel. Our correspondent reports that, more policemen had been drafted in to beef up security around the CBN. The State Commissioner of Police, Danmallam Mohammed and the command spokesperson, Mr. Chidi Nwabuzor, could not be reached for comment at the time of filling this report.
