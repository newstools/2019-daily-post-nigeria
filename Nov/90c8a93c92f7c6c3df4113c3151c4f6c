The Supreme Court has held that Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and his party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) were not able to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC had a server and that it transmitted election results electronically. The apex court stated this while giving its reasons for dismissing the appeal by the PDP and Atiku. The court held that the PDP and Atiku were wrong to have relied on results to get from a website: www.factsdontlieng.co., whose owner they could not establish, to claim to have won the election. Justice Inyang Okoro, the lead judge, said, “I agree entirely with the court below that the appellants failed to prove that INEC has the server from which they got their figures. “As a result, all the results, calculations, and analysis based on the results claimed are of no moment.” The court resolved issue 3 against the appellant. The apex court also resolved issue 4 against irregularity and corrupt practices against the appellants. The 5th issue was also resolved against the appellant, which relates to the admission of some documents tendered by the respondents to the petition before the lower court. The Supreme Court proceeded to dismiss the appeal after resolving all the five issues determined against the appellants.
