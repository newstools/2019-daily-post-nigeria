The convener of #RevolutionNow protest, Omoyele Sowore has met the bail conditions imposed on him. DAILY POST reports that Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu had, on Oct. 21, varied the bail conditions granted Sowore, and his co-defendant, Olawale Bakare. Justice Ojukwu granted the order in a ruling on the application for bail variation by the duo charged with treasonable felony among others. She waived the earlier requirement, stating that Sowore should deposit N50m as security and also reduced the amount attached to Bakare’s bail. Ojukwu added that the defendants be remanded in the custody of the Department of State Service (DSS) pending when they are able to meet the bail conditions. The judge, thereafter, adjourned till Nov. 6 and 7 for the commencement of trial. Upon commencement of trial on Wednesday, Human rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), told the Federal High Court in Abuja that the defendants would be freed later on Wednesday. He said, “I have already explained to the learned prosecuting counsel that we are encumbered by the refusal of the State Security Service to allow us to prepare for the defence of the defendants. “I had already asked my learned counsel for the prosecution, that we are confident that the defendants will be freed today (Wednesday) from the custody of the SSS having met the bail conditions imposed on them by this honourable court. “Once they are liberated from the custody of the SSS, we will be in a position to take full instruction from them.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
