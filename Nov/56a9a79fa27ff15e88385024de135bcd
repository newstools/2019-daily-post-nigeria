The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State on Thursday said it remains in the race for the November 16 governorship election. The party insisted that in spite of a Federal High Court judgment that nullified the party’s governorship primary of Sept 4, 2019, the party would participate. DAILY POST reports that a the High Court presided over by Justice Jane Inyang had on Thursday nullified the nomination of Chief David Lyon as the candidate of the APC. Inyang held that the primary election conducted by the APC violated the party’s rules and constitution and therefore a nullity in the eyes of the law and restrained INEC from recognising any of the aspirants that participated in the exercise. Reacting to the judgment, Mr Jothan Amos, Chairman of Bayelsa chapter of APC, said that the party was optimistic of overcoming the setback before Saturday’s poll. According to NAN, Amos said that the party had set in motion the legal process of appeal and was in the process of obtaining a stay of execution pending the determination of the appeal. He assured party followers that the APC was seeking judicial review of the judgment and urged them to remain calm. Recall that a Federal High Court in Abuja had on Tuesday disqualified the Deputy Governorship candidate of APC for the Bayelsa governorship election Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo, from participating in the forthcoming election. The court disqualified the Deputy Governorship candidate on the grounds that he provided conflicting information on the documents he presented to INEC.
