The Court of Appeal sitting in Makurdi, the Benue State capital has sacked the Deputy Speaker Benue Assembly Christopher Adaji (Ohimini/PDP). The court affirmed the earlier decision of the National/State House of Assembly Election Tribunal sacking the lawmaker. The lead judge of the three-man panel Justice I. G. Mbaba, who delivered the judgment, said the appeal by the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) and Christopher Adaji, lacks merit. Mbaba upheld the decision of the Tribunal and return of Adaji by Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the winner of the 2019 Ohimini State Constituency election. The court further held that the findings of the Tribunal has not been appealed. “I find no merit in this appeal,” Justice Mbaba held and consequently dismissed the same. He directed the INEC to conduct a fresh election in the two polling units within 90 days as earlier ordered by the Tribunal. The court awarded the cost N200, 000.00 only in each of the appeals against the appellants as cost.
