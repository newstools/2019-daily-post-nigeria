Chelsea midfielder, Willian, has named Ronaldinho as the best player of all time, ahead of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldinho made his name at Barca, where he played alongside Messi. The Brazilian made more than 200 appearances and won LaLiga twice and the Champions League. He then left Spain for AC Milan, before winding down his career back in Brazil with clubs like Atletico Mineiro and Fluminese. Ronaldinho hung up his boots in 2015. “Ronaldinho was the best of all time. Better than Messi and Cristiano. “They score goals, but what Ronnie did was incredible. He was amazing on the field and also scored. “As a fan of his, I have to say that he left too soon. “If he had kept up the level a couple of years, he would have won many more Ballon d’Or’s,” Willian said according to the UK Mirror.
