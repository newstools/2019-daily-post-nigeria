The Ogun State Police Command confirmed the incident. Adenuga was said to have been abducted around 10pm on Wednesday at his residence when the gunmen held him at gunpoint and whisked him away. DAILY POST learnt that Adenuga had hardly returned from office to his Aiyepe hometown when the incident happened.
