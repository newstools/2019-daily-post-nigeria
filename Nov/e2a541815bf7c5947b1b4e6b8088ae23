The Police in Enerhen Divisional Headquarters on Wednesday arrested a suspected thief and his girlfriend (names unknown) for allegedly passing the night inside a Sterling Bank toilet in Uvwie Local Government Area of Delta State. The suspects were found inside the bank’s restrooms when Staff resumed operations for the day, DAILY POST can report. It is not clear yet if the suspects stole any money or items from the bank but they were discovered by the bank’s cleaner carrying out her duties in the toilets area. As at the time of this report, details of how the suspects breached the bank’s security and gained access were still sketchy. In a chat with Our Correspondent, a bank official who craved anonymity said, “The suspects may have entered the bank the previous day with a motive to steal. Thank God they were caught.” Security Operatives investigating the matter had cordoned off the bank and shut customers and onlookers out and also prevented our correspondent from gaining access to the suspects. While the Delta State Police Command is yet to confirm the incident, the state commissioner, CP Adeyinka Adeleke said, “The DPO has been dispatched to Asaba to investigate, I will get back to you when he confirms the incident.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
