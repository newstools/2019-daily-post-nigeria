Chelsea defender, Kurt Zouma has praised fellow teammate, Olivier Giroud as a true ‘professional’ despite being ‘frustrated’ by his lack of game time at Stamford Bridge. Zouma also said that Giroud still gives advice to Blues teammates, Tammy Abraham and Michy Batshuayi, adding that the striker wants the best for Chelsea. Giroud has barely featured for Chelsea this season with manager, Frank Lampard preferring Abraham and Batshuayi as his first and second choice strikers. The former Arsenal star recently expressed frustration while on international duty for France at his lack of minutes for Chelsea this season and said that he “will make a decision in January” over his future. “Giroud is frustrated, he wants to play more,” Zouma told Canal+. “Like any football player, he wants to be on the pitch, but he is taking everything very calmly. “He is a professional, he works hard in training. I have a lot of respect for the player he is. “As someone in the dressing room, he is someone who gives advice to Tammy and Michy. “He wants the best for the team, which is important, and it is why he is a good person.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
