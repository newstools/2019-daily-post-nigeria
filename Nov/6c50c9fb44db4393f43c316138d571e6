Former Real Madrid goalkeeper, Iker Casillas, has said neither his former team mate, Cristiano Ronaldo or Barcelona’s Lionel Messi, deserve to win this year’s Ballon D’Or prize. Casillas, instead has chosen Liverpool defender, Virgil van Dijk, as the best man for the award. Messi recently picked up the FIFA Best award, while Van Dijk took the UEFA Player of the Year gong. They are both considered to be the frontrunners for the Ballon d’Or, but Casillas told talkSPORT: “For me, the winner is obvious: Virgil van Dijk. “I believe that because of the massive impact he’s had on Liverpool Football Club. “Obviously, you’re dealing with the best players in the world and when you look at Lionel Messi’s goalscoring record, if he did win it over Van Dijk, you would have to understand why. “But his form didn’t help Barcelona win the Champions League. Usually (nine out of the last 12 years) the winner of the Ballon d’Or comes from the winner of the Champions League. The criteria is there and I don’t see why that should change. “In terms of a defender winning it, there are some people who would say it’s easier to destroy than create and I understand that philosophy. But when you look at the impact on others and the way he gets others to perform around him, that’s a wonderful quality.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
