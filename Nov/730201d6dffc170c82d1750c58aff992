The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has described the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu as the “worst electoral umpire” in the political history of Nigeria. PDP made the claim while lamenting over the conduct of the just concluded elections in Bayelsa and Kogi States, stressing that Nigerians across board has completely lost faith in the nation’s electoral process under the current regime. In a statement signed by its spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP also alleged that President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) are against democracy in Nigeria. The statement reads: “For us in the PDP and, we believe, to the majority of Nigerians as well, Professor Yakubu is the worst electoral umpire in the political history of our nation. “Furthermore, the police and the military high commands have been reduced to tools of election brutality to ensure that votes do not count. “Even the Police high command has openly admitted that the police are incapable of protecting voters and votes; thus validating the reported involvement of security agents in the brutalization of voters and disruption of the electoral process. “More distressing is the fact that Nigerians, particularly our members and supporters in Kogi and Bayelsa states, are still in trauma over the murderous November 16 elections. “A lot of our people have been killed and our members are still grieving.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
