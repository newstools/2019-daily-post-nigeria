No fewer than 13 persons lost their lives, while 10 others sustained injuries in a multiple accident around Saapade, near Ogere on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, on Wednesday. Florence Okpe, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) spokesman in Ogun, in a statement said the crash occurred around 5 pm at Saapade, where diversion was created by RCC, the construction company currently working on the rehabilitation of the corridor. She noted that the accident was caused by a speeding truck heading towards Lagos which suddenly suffered a tyre burst. “In the process, the truck collided head on with two other speeding commuter buses heading towards Ibadan, with one of them, in the process, attempting to wrongfully overtake within the diversion area. “The vehicles involved are a yellow Mazda bus, marked KTU 93 XW, a white Toyota bus with registration number: KEY 847 XA and a Man diesel truck, marked KAB 97 XA,” Okpe noted. The spokesman explained that the accident involved a total of 37 people, comprising 20 male adults, 15 female adults and two female children. People injured in the crash were 10, comprising four male adults and six female adults, adding that 13 persons, comprising four male adults, seven female adults and two female children, died in the accident. Okpe said that the corpses of the deceased had been deposited at the Ipara mortuary, while the injured were taken to Victory Hospital, Ogere.
Oladele said that the incident would have been avoided if the maximum speed limit of 50 at diversion and construction zones was observed. The official requested the relations of the victims to contact the FRSC command in Ogere or Victory Hospital. She added that the FRSC can always be contacted on its toll free number 122.
