Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, scored two brilliant free-kicks and his first hat-trick of the season, as they beat Celta Vigo 4-1 at the Camp Nou on Saturday. Messi put the Catalans ahead from the spot in the 23rd minute, before giving away a foul from which Lucas Olaza equalized. But the Argentine superstar restored Barca before halftime, curling the ball into the top corner. Messi added another free-kick after the break to make it 3-1, before Sergio Busquets struck the fourth goal. It was the first win for Barca in three games, after falling to a shock 3-1 defeat at Levante last week in LaLiga and drawing 0-0 at home to Slavia Prague in the Champions League. They remain on top with 25 points, but a better goal difference from Real Madrid.
