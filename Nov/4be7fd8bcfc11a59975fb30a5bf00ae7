Uruguay striker, Edinson Cavani reportedly asked Argentina captain, Lionel Messi, if he wanted to fight him during both side’s international friendly 2-2 draw on Monday night. Goals from Edinson Cavani, Luis Suarez, Sergio Aguero and Lionel Messi ensure both teams played a draw in Tel Aviv, Israel. According to Argentine newspaper, Ole, Cavani was spotted on camera telling Messi during the match to fight him. Messi, in response, told the Paris Saint-Germain star ‘whenever you want’. This came as the pair were involved in a bust-up during the encounter. It followed a strong foul on Messi that sparked an argument between him and Cavani as the action continued in the tunnel at half-time. However, it took Uruguay striker, Luis Suarez to separate Cavani and Messi. Speaking after the game, Cavani played down the incident. The former Napoli star was quoted by ESPN as saying: “It was a classic, a very friction match with strong entries such as South American football. “On both sides there are good things, we leave with a positive feeling and we try to play football, then it was already a classic, we live it like this.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
