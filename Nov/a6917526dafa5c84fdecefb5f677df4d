Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has said Manchester City and Pep Guardiola will be “devastated”, following their defeat to Premier League title rivals Liverpool. The Premier League champions were beaten 3-1 at Anfield on Sunday afternoon to slip nine points behind the Reds. Fabinho, Mohammed Salah and Sadio Mane all scored for the hosts, before Bernardo Silva pulled one back. “First of all, to lose a big game is terrible. “You saw the reactions from both of the managers tonight. You can see the pressure they are under and how much a game like that means to both of them. “Pep will go home and be absolutely devastated, more than you think. If you think a quantity, add 100% and you might get close to that. “Overall, nine points is too big a difference for Man City after 12 games,” Wenger told beIN Sports.
