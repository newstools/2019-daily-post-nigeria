Two men have been indicted for “terrorist criminal conspiracy” and placed in pre-trial detention over a bomb plot against French President, Emmanuel Macron. Franceinfo, a French news channel, reported this on Saturday. The plotters, aged 30 and 45 respectively, were arrested in Moselle, northeastern France. They had been presented to an examining magistrate for their indictment. The national anti-terrorist prosecutor’s office had requested their detention on remand. The suspects were believed to have planned an action against President Macron during the commemoration of the centenary of the end of the First World War, in Nov. 2018.
