Governor Darius Ishaku of Taraba State has described Friday reports on social media carrying rumours of a purported impeachment of principal officers of the Taraba State House of Assembly including the Speaker, Abel Peter Diah as false and malicious. Governor Darius Ishaku made his position known in a statement signed by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mr. Bala Dan Abu and made available to newsmen saying, “The article made spurious claims to the effect that Governor Darius Dickson Ishaku was the sponsor of that so-called impeachment plot and that he had committed N200 million Naira public funds to it. “Nothing can be more untrue. It is yet another wicked and malicious attempt to cause confusion and conflict in the relationship between the executive and legislative arms of government in the state on the one hand and governor Ishaku and Peter Diah, his political godson, on the other.” According to the statement, both men have had several years of fruitful personal and official relationships nurtured by mutual trust, cooperation and collaboration. It further explained that Governor Ishaku would never sponsor and did not sponsor the so-called impeachment move, “If indeed there was any such move by the Honourable members, let alone fund it with such a staggering amount of money from the public purse,” the statement explained. “The allegations are ridiculous, absolutely false and malicious. It is certainly for these reasons that the author of the article failed to sign it. Governor Ishaku wants the general public to ignore this article and the lies contained in it,” the statement clarified. The statement, however, described governor Ishaku as an apostle of peace who will not do anything that will rock the existing level of trust and understanding between him and members of the State House of Assembly.
