Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola has tipped his assistant, Mikel Arteta to become an outstanding manager amid reports linking him to replace Arsenal coach, Unai Emery at Emirates. DAILY POST had earlier reported that Arsenal chiefs are interested in talking to Arteta and former Juventus manager, Max Allegri about replacing Emery at Emirates following the clubs disappointing 2-2 draw at home against Southampton in the Premier League over the weekend. But reacting, Guardiola was quoted by Metro UK as saying: “I think for my news Unai Emery is the manager for Arsenal, so… of course he [Arteta] will be a manager sooner or later. “If I was in his position, as an assistant coach as young as he is, always we will have that. Now we are going to finish this season and in the future, I don’t know what is going to happen.” He added: “I would like honestly for him to stay with us as long as possible. Not just Pep, Manchester City has an incredibly valuable person to work in this club for the future. “But personal life is personal life. Professional desires are professional, each one. Everyone, not just me, is more than satisfied to have him here, but what will happen at the end of the season I don’t know.” Arteta, a former Arsenal midfielder, has enjoyed much success as an assistant to Guardiola at Manchester City.
