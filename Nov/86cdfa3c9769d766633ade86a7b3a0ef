Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has said it is not important whether or not his side wins the Premier League title this season, ESPN reports. Guardiola insists that he only demands his team push Liverpool as far as they can. Man City remains nine points behind leaders Liverpool, after a 2-1 win over Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday. “I think it’s not a good message for society, for our kids, for our teenagers, showing them that just the winner is perfect,” Guardiola said. “We are creating a depressed people, loser people. “It is not, what is important is the effort, the commitment, the situation. In football I know we want to win but just win once and the other is a disaster? It’s not, it doesn’t work in that way. That’s why I said to the players relax, do your job, we will see in December, January, February, March and we will see what position we are in. “If the position is far away, OK it’s far away. We are going to try again next season.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
