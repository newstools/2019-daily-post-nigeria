Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has revealed that Tahith Chong apologised to his teammates, after his horror open goal miss against Astana. Chong was gifted a tap-in by Luke Shaw to put United into a 2-0 lead, during the second half of the Europa League clash. But instead of scoring his first senior goal for the Red Devils, he blasted the ball over the bar. Less than a minute later, Astana were level through Dmitriy Shomko, before Di’Shon Bernard put through his own goal. “Yeah, of course, he knows he messed up, but he said the same in the dressing room. “It’s a difficult game, but no forward or striker should worry about missing chances. That’s about growing up, I think I did that as well when I was young,” Solskjaer told BT Sport.
