Two members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) currently undergoing their 3-week orientation course for the 2019 Batch C Stream 1 in Ebonyi State have been sacked from the orientation camp. The Corps members were sacked from camp for refusing to wear trousers. It was learnt that the duo refused to wear trousers because it was against their faith and as such preferred to wear skirt. The two corps members are Okafor Love Obianuju with registration number EB/19C/0523 and Odji Oritsetsolaye (EB/19C/0530). Spokesperson of the NYSC in the state, Ngozi Ukwuoma disclosed this in a statement made available to newsmen on Saturday. She said that they were caught by the camp director, Mrs Isu Josephine, and her team during routine inspection. The statement reads in part: “When they were accosted and interrogated, they disclosed that they could not wear the white shorts and the trousers given to them by the NYSC since it was against their faith. “Efforts were, however, made by the office of the Camp Director to make them see reason why they must obey the rules and regulations guiding the orientation and NYSC, but all efforts to do that proved futile “The corps members were queried and subsequently made to face the camp court where they were found guilty.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
