Head coach of Benin Republic, Michel Dussuyer, has admitted that his side was defeated by a superior opponent following their 2-1 defeat to Nigeria in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, qualifier encounter on Wednesday. According to Dussuyer, Gernot Rohr’s side did not create many opportunities in the first half but gained more confidence in the second half after scoring a penalty. DAILY POST had reported that the Super Eagles had to fight from a goal down, as the Squirrels opened scoring at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo. Stephane Sessegnon latched on a defensive error to make it 1-0. Victor Osimhen made it 1-1 from the penalty spot, shortly before half time. Samuel Kalu grabbed the winner, with a fine solo goal. “We played well in the first half, defended well, Nigeria did not create many opportunities but we conceded a penalty just before the half time which gave more confidence to Nigeria in the second half,” Dussuyer told reporters at his post-match press conference in Uyo. “The second half was very hard for us and we wasted many balls, gave it to Nigeria so many times. “In the end we tried to recover after conceding and we had an opportunity at the end (which hit the post) but it is logical; there’s a difference between Nigeria and Benin but we have fought for as much as we can.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
