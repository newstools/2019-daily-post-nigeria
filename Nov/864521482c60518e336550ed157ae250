The Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja on Thursday upheld the election of Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State. The court dismissed the appeal filed by the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate in the poll, Emmanuel Jime, for lacking in merit. In a unanimous judgment, the court also resolved all the issues against the appellants. The court also awarded the sum of N150,000 fine against Jime. Governor Ortom contested for re-election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) after defecting from the APC.
