An Ikorodu Magistrates’ Court in Lagos State, on Monday, remanded a 25-year-old prophet, Adebowale Obaloluwa, in custody over alleged defilement of a 14-year-old girl. The defendant, who claimed to be a prophet and interpreter of tongues at a branch of Cherubim and Seraphim church, is facing a charge of defilement. His plea was, however, not taken by the court.
