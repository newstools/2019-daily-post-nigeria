Former Liverpool midfielder, Vladimír Smicer singled out Super Eagles’ Peter Olayinka for special praise after Slavia Prague drew 0-0 with Barcelona in the Champions League on Tuesday. Olayinka put up an excellent performance against the European giants and was clearly one of the most impressive players on the night. Olayinka started on the left wing and proved a handful for the Barcelona defenders with his pace and physicality. Smicer told UEFA official website, ”Slavia fully deserved their point. They stood firm; there’s nothing to be ashamed of. ”It is a pity they did not take one of the chances. Olayinka was excellent, especially in the first half.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
