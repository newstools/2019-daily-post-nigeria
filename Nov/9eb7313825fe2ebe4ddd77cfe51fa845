Nigeria’s premier movie at the Oscars, ‘‘Lionheart’’ would have won the Oscars if only it had been in Igbo language with English subtitles. This is according to social commentator and a PDP chieftain, Femi Fani-Kayode. He was reacting to the disqualification of the movie directed and produced by the star actress, Genevieve Nnaji by the Oscars. The Oscar Academy had on Monday disqualified the “Lionheart” from the race in the Best International Feature Film category. Lionheart was disqualified for violating the Academy rule for entries in its category that mandates movies to be in ‘‘predominantly non-English dialogue track.” Unfortunately, the movie, Lionheart, in which Nnaji also stars, is mostly in English language, with excerpts of Igbo language scenes. The Academy announced the disqualification of “Lionheart” to voters in the category in an email on Monday. Fani Kayode says the Nollywood movie would have been on its way to winning the best international film at the Oscars if it had adhered to the rules. ‘‘It is so sad and unfair, after- all English is our lingua franca in Nigeria even though we hate to admit it’’ he said. “My heart goes out to @GenevieveNnaji1 and all the other wonderful Nigerian thespians both in Lionheart and in other Nollywood movies that have brought honour and glory to Nigeria through their noble endeavours. Despite this setback, you have done us proud! Keep it up! #Lionheart.”
