Paris Saint-Germain are set to replace star player, Kylian Mbappe with Barcelona forward, Antoine Griezmann. According to FourFourTwo, the Ligue 1 champions believe Griezmann is the ideal and perfect replacement for Mbappe, who is wanted by Real Madrid. The British newspaper reports that PSG feels the former Atletico Madrid star has the ideal profile to work alongside their star striker, Mauro Icardi and Neymar and are willing to enact their €70 million buy option on the player. DAILY POST had reported that Mbappe was linked with a move from Paris Saint-Germain to Madrid last summer, but ended up staying with the Ligue 1 side. The France international has been impressive for PSG so far this season. The 20-year-old has scored seven goals and assisted four in nine appearances for the Ligue 1 champions this term.
