Premier League legend, Alan Shearer has warned Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola that the Citizens ‘cannot afford’ to lose to Liverpool when both sides clash in the Premier League on Sunday at Anfield. Writing in his column for the Sun, Shearer said: “Sunday’s trip to Anfield is a match Pep Guardiola just simply cannot afford to lose. “Liverpool will go nine points clear by beating Manchester City in their crunch title clash. “With a deficit like that — even in mid-November — Guardiola knows he would have a mountain to climb to win the Premier League. “The Reds have turned Anfield into a fortress and they haven’t lost there in 45 Premier League matches stretching back to April 2017. “That is an astonishing record and means they start this game as favourites despite City arriving as back-to-back champions. “You can expect a battle right to the final whistle. “Both teams showed how they can fight to the death with dramatic late wins at the weekend. “Jurgen Klopp’s side seem to have forgotten how to lose and went from 1-0 down at 87 minutes to coming away with three points at Aston Villa.” Liverpool are currently on top of the Premier League table with six points ahead of second-place Man City after eleven matches.
