DAILY POST reported yesterday that in his ruling, Justice Oathman Musa of the Federal High Court in Abuja, held that the matter against Fatoyinbo amounted to injustice and an abuse of judicial process; adding that the case was empty and purely sentimental. The judge further explained that the case was aimed more at cruelty than at obtaining justice. The court also awarded costs of N1m against Busola Dakolo and held that the fine should have been 10 times more because the court’s time was wasted. Dakolo has vowed to appeal the court’s decision.
