Reno Omokri, former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, on Wednesday mocked Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, saying he has “audio power.” Omokri made the remark while faulting the decision of President Muhammadu Buhari’s Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari to travel down to London with the amended Deep Offshore Act for Buhari’s assent. In a post on his Facebook, the former presidential aide stated that while Osinbajo has “audio power” Kyari has “De factor power.” He also berated the National Assembly for failing to condemn Buhari’s failure to handover power to Osinbajo before traveling to London. He wrote: “You are going on a 2 week “private visit” and you can’t have over to Osinbajo. Kyari has to take strange documents for you to sign in London. It is obvious. Osinbajo has AUDIO POWER, while Abba Kyari has DE FACTO POWER! “How can APC even say an unelected Chief of Staff is more powerful than a supposedly elected Vice President? That is the definition of a CABAL. And our rubber stamp National Assembly is quiet. Don’t you just miss Saraki? Nigeria can’t be led by General Buhari’s unelected puppeteers.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
