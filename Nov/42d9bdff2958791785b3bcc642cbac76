Chelsea striker, Tammy Abraham has allayed fears he had suffered a serious problem during their 2-2 draw with Valencia last night. Abraham suffered a painful hip injury during the Champions League clash. He landed awkwardly on Ezequiel Garay at the end of the first half and was in obvious pain as he limped off the pitch. He had to be taken off on a stretcher at the Mestalla, but while initial reports suggested he had gone to hospital, the 22-year-old received treatment inside the dressing room. “I got in and was able to walk again, move about, so I’m thankful and hopefully it’s not too long,” he told BT Sport. “I hope so [bruising]. I’ll have a scan or x-ray tomorrow to see what the news is but hopefully it is just bruising. It was a knee to my hip area, so hopefully it’s nothing too serious.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
