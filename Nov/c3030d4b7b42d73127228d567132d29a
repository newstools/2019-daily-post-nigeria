Former England manager, Fabio Capello has advised fellow Italian Massimiliano Allegri to wait for the Manchester United job to become available. While Capello feels that his compatriot would do well in the Bundesliga in the light of Niko Kovac’s sacking as Bayern Munich coach earlier this week, he has advised him to wait for his opportunity in the Premier League. Asked by Football Italia whether he thought that Allegri should consider a move to Bayern, with whom he has been heavily linked, Capello said: “Allegri would be a good fit at Bayern Munich, although I don’t know how welcome Italians are in Germany after [Carlo] Ancelotti. “England’s exciting, there’s the possibility of doing well and the Premier League is a championship that enriches you. “If I was Allegri, I’d go to Manchester.” Capello was one of Allegri’s managerial predecessors at Juventus, where the latter won five consecutive Serie A titles before his departure at the end of last season. As two of the most successful Italian coaches in recent history, Capello won the Scudetto four times with AC Milan, and once with Roma.
