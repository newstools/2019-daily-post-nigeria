Chelsea defender, Kurt Zouma, has hailed fellow teammate, Fikayo Tomori as a “very talented” player ahead of the Blues’ UEFA Champions League clash with Ajax at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night. According to Zouma, the 21-year-old has pace, can defend very well and even on one-on-ones he doesn’t get beaten. Speaking to the Evening Standard, Zouma said: “I am chatting a lot with Fikayo. We are both young but we also have [Cesar] Azpi[licueta] on one side, Marcos [Alonso] too and Jorginho in front of us and they are experienced. “The thing is, the age doesn’t matter. You can see, you can play well. We talk a lot and it is all about communication. He [Tomori] is very talented. He got his first call-up in the last few weeks and he deserved it. “You can see the way he plays, he is very comfortable with the ball and without it, he has got pace and can defend very well, even on one-on-ones he doesn’t get beaten. “He is a very good player for us. Like everyone, he is working hard because the competition is hard. We just want to be on the pitch doing well.” The kick-off time for the match is 9pm.
