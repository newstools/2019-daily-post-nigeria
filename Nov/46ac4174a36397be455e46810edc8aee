Former Manchester United and Liverpool striker, Michael Owen, has predicted some of today’s UEFA Champions League fixtures. Chelsea will take on Dutch giants, Ajax at Stamford Bridge following a 2-1 victory over Watford in the Premier League last weekend. Liverpool will tackle Genk at Anfield after defeating Aston Villa 2-1 in the Premier League on Saturday. Speaking with Betfair, Owen gave his predictions thus; Chelsea vs Ajax: “Frank Lampard’s side have bounced back tremendously well in the Champions League when you consider they lost their opening game at home to Valencia and I think the Blues will edge what promises to be another terrific game between two inform, free-scoring sides. “Chelsea FC were 2-1 winners against Watford at Vicarage Road on Saturday evening thanks to goals from Tammy Abraham and Christian Pulisic. The Blues are in fourth place in the table and six points ahead of fifth-placed Arsenal in the race to secure a place in next season’s Champions League.” Liverpool vs Genk: “Liverpool are unbeaten in their last 23 home European games (W17 D6) and it would be a major surprise if Genk – struggling midtable in the Belgian First Division – were able to stop the Reds from going into Sunday’s vital league game with Manchester City on the back of another comfortable home win,” Owen told BetVictor. “Jurgen Klopp’s side won the reverse fixture 4-1 in Belgian on Matchday 3, but I can’t see the visitors finding the back of the net at Anfield.” The kick-off time for all the matches is 9pm.
