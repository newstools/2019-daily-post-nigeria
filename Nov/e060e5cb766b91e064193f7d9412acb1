Former Arsenal defender, Martin Keown, has advised new caretaker boss, Freddie Ljungberg, to drop David Luiz following Unai Emery’s dismissal. Ljungberg has been placed in charge of the Gunners on a temporary basis after Emery lost his job at the Emirates. Arsenal travel to Carrow Road to face Norwich City on Sunday and Keown believes Luiz should be dropped to the bench for the Premier League clash. “Whoever they decide to bring in after Freddie Ljungberg will be inheriting the same problems that Emery failed to fix,” he told the Daily Mail. “Their lack of solidity at the back, for example. For Norwich on Sunday, I’d have David Luiz on the bench. “Sokratis and Calum Chambers would be my centre backs and I’d have Lucas Torreira deep in that midfield, patrolling that area in front of them. “Get that triangle right, then build the team from there. Whoever comes in after Emery’s exit, he has a big job to do. The board have to get this one right.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
