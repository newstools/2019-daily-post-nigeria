Nigerian-born Juventus forward, Eni Aluko, has noted that the current Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola must lift the Champions League title with Manchester City to be considered an all-time great. Guardiola has not won the champions league competition since he captured the trophy twice with Barcelona in the 2008-09 and 2010-11 seasons. However, 32-year-old Aluko believes that 48-year-old manager’s failure to reach the final without Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi could see him miss out in the conversation for all-time greats. Aluko, a former England international took a shot at the former Barcelona boss by saying that Liverpool’s Jurgen Klopp managed to win the trophy with Divock Origi last season. “Guardiola has never got to a European final without Lionel Messi, whereas Klopp has won one with Divock Origi,” she told The Guardian. “Guardiola’s Barcelona side won the treble of La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League in 2008-09, something no other manager had done, but Luis Enrique repeated the feat in 2014-15 and nobody has him down as one of the all-time greats. “Jose Mourinho won the Champions League with Porto and Internazionale and eight league titles in four countries, yet he seems to be disregarded as an old‑school manager with outdated ideas. “Guardiola, who is one of the most successful trophy-winning managers in history, has failed to progress past the quarter-final stages of the competition with City so far. And the former Bayern Munich boss claimed only last month that his side was not ready to win UEFA’s coveted prize this season. “Guardiola […] took over Barcelona when they had won the league in two of the previous four seasons, Bayern Munich when they were reigning champions, and Manchester City when they had been champions in two of the five previous seasons and had unrivalled spending power.”- Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
