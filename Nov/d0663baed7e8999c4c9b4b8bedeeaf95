Rafa Benitez has tipped his former club, Liverpool, to win this season’s Premier League title ahead of Manchester City. Both teams clash this Sunday at Anfield, with the Reds six points ahead of City at the top of the table. Last season, Pep Guardiola’s men won the title by one point, with Liverpool finishing second. However, Benitez is confident they will win it this time around. He wrote in the Athletic: “After last year, Liverpool have more experience and that’s always a positive, but City have grown used to being at the top. They know what it takes to win. They also have fantastic talent. “What Liverpool possess is the advantage and they certainly have the potential to go one step further, but this is football and it’s far too early to talk about what will happen in May. Nothing is definitive in November. “Are Liverpool doing well? Yes. Do they have a great team and a great manager? Yes. Can they win the title? Yes, of course. “Why can they win it? Because they’ve done things right for the last few years and now they have the resources to back that up. That’s the biggest difference.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
