Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, has recovered from injury but does not want to play for the club, according to Sport Witness. It is claimed that sources from inside the Old Trafford dressing room, insist Pogba is fit. The 26-year-old is now so desperate to leave Old Trafford and join Real Madrid in January, he has effectively gone on strike. Solskjaer, however, maintains the player is still recovering from an ankle injury. The Norwegian who refused to sell Pogba in the summer is now willing to allow him leave. Pogba has not featured since United’s 1-1 draw with Arsenal at the end of September and Solskjaer was targeting the Manchester Derby on December 7 as a potential comeback date for the World Cup winner.
