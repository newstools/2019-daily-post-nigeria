One Rotimi Adelodun, a senior driver at Innovative Multi-Concept Transport Company, Lagos and his two other accomplices have been sentenced to jail by Ejigbo Magistrate court over conspiracy to steal and sell a company’s truck. It was said that Adelodun was instructed by one Mr. Dayo Bello, the company’s Managing Director, to get a buyer for one truck head which was damaged in order to free the space it was occupying at the company’s parking space. According to the Prosecutor, Supol Kenneth Asibor, Adelodun got one Mr. Kabiru Bello who deals in buying of iron scraps to buy the truck head from the director. He explained further: “Thereafter, at another time, Rotimi, the driver went to call Kabiru again, took him to another truck valued at N4million and sold it for him at N450,000 without the knowledge of the company’s Managing Director and ran away with the company’s Toyota Previa with registration no: EU 263 LSR. “The secret was exposed when the logistics manager discovered that a truck was missing at Igbele park and immediately informed the MD on phone. “Mr. Bello, the MD then reported the case to the police and Mr. Rotimi was later accosted by the police in Ibadan, Oyo State while the police in Lagos together with the MD went to arrest him and recovered the car from him. “He then confessed to having sold the truck to Kabiru who also said it was one Mustapha Muhammed that bought the truck.” After three years that the case has been charged to court in August 2016, it was finally decided at Ejigbo Magistrate court last week. Giving his judgment, the presiding magistrate, Hon. Teslim Shomade, sentenced Rotimi Adelodun to two years imprisonment with hard labour, Kabiru Bello to 12 months jail term with hard labour, and Mustapha to six months jail with an option of N100,000 fine to be paid to the Lagos state government.
