Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has confirmed that his side will be without their number one goalkeeper, Ederson, when they take on Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday at Anfield. According to Guardiola, second-choice keeper, Claudio Bravo will feature for the Citizens in the absence of the Brazilian international. Ederon was substituted at half-time during Man City’s Champions League 1-1 draw against Atalanta some few days ago after sustaining a muscular problem. Speaking at his pre-match press conference on Friday, Guardiola was quoted by Man City’s official website as telling reporters: “Ederson is not able to play. I don’t know how long he will be out for, but Sunday, he cannot play. “We have another keeper. Claudio Bravo and he can do it, too. I have every confidence in him. “We won the Carabao Cup thanks to Claudio. He is an exceptional keeper and has won a lot of international games and tournaments with Chile. I have no doubts.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
