Legal luminary, Femi Falana, has alerted that the Department of State Services (DSS) was preparing a fresh charge against Omoyele Sowore, convener of RevolutionNow Movement. The Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), who is the counsel to the publisher of SaharaReporters, raised the alarm on Channels TV programme on Monday. Last Wednesday, a federal high court in Abuja, ordered the release of Sowore alongside Olawale Adebayo. The DSS is yet comply with the order and claimed that no surety had come to take Sowore on bail. But Falana stated that the plot was to keep Sowore incarcerated. “I was reliably informed last night by a security official that the government was currently fishing for evidence,” he said. “An attempt is being made to file a fresh charge on Tuesday so that there will be an excuse that ‘we are arraigning them in court, hence we are unable to release them’. “If you recall, that was what was done when Justice Taiwo Taiwo granted Sowore bail on September 24. “For a whole week, the order of the court was flouted. And then, of course, on September 30, he was arraigned together with Olawale Bakare. We are ready for them.” Falana also declared readiness to file contempt charge against DSS Director-General, Yusuf Bichi.
