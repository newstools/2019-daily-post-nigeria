The Kogi State Resident Electoral Commissioner, Professor James Apam, has blamed the low turnout of voters in the Saturday’s Kogi West senatorial district rerun on poor mobilisation by political parties. He was speaking against the backdrop of voters’ apathy observed in most polling units visited by DAILY POST in Lokoja wards. Apam said that instead of the political parties to embark on membership drive aimed at convincing their supporters on the need to come out and vote for them, they turned around to blame the Independent National Electoral Commission for poor turnout of voters. Some voters told our correspondent, that the low turnout could be blamed on the fear of a repeat of the violence that greeted the November 16 election. Bala Bariga, a Peoples Democratic Party chieftain, who spoke with DAILY POST at Ward C Polling Unit 001 attributed the low turnout to citizens’ mindsets that their votes don’t count. He also said more voters stayed away for fear of being caught in any violent crossfire. However, as of the time of filing this report, there has not been any reported case of violence as the few voters on the queue were seen casting their votes without any hindrance.
