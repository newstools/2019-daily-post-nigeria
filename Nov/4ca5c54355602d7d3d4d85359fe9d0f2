Former Italy and England national team coach, Fabio Capello, has criticised Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo after Maurizio Sarri’s men defeated AC Milan 1-0 in the Serie A on Sunday. Ronaldo reacted angrily after being replaced by Paulo Dybala in the 55th minute during the encounter and immediately made his way up the tunnel. The 34-year-old also left the stadium three minutes to the end of the match. But. Capello, Who supported Juventus manager, Maurizio Sarri’s decision to substitute Ronaldo, said that the Portugal international had not dribbled past anyone in the last three years. “[Cristiano] is a great champion, nobody argues with that, but he hasn’t dribbled past anyone in the last three years,” Capello told Sky Sport Italia. “At the moment, he isn’t at his best and it is normal to replace him. Sarri doesn’t need to be brave or show his personality to make that change. “It’s not nice that he didn’t sit on the bench [after being taken off] and argued with Sarri. “One has to be a champion even when he is replaced, not only when things are going well. He must respect his team-mates.” Juventus will now take on Atalanta in their next Serie A fixture.
