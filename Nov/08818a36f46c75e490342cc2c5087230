Former Manchester United and Liverpool striker, Michael Owen, has predicted some of this week’s UEFA Europa League fixtures. Manchester United will take on Partizan Belgrade in the Europa League at Old Trafford on Thursday following a 1-0 defeat to Bournemouth in the Premier League last weekend, while Arsenal will tackle Vitoria on Wednesday evening in an away fixture. Speaking with Betfair, Owen gave his predictions thus; Manchester United vs Partizan: “United came up short at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday but I am prepared to forgive Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side for that defeat – their fourth away game in nine days – and feel they will take all three points against the Serbs and qualify for the knockout stages of the competition with two games to spare. “Solskjaer may well field a young and inexperienced side but United are unbeaten in their last 10 home games in the Europa League and have yet to concede in the competition so far this season.” Vitoria vs Arsenal: “Two late Nicolas Pepe free kicks kept the points in London in the reverse fixture two weeks ago and Arsenal are taken to maintain their perfect record in the group stages out in Portugal. “Vitoria are unbeaten in their three games against English opposition on home soil, while the Gunners have only won one of their six previous visits to Portugal, but I still feel Unai Emery’s side will take all three points and confirm their place in the last 32 of competition, they reached the final of last season.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
