Suspected armed robbers have murdered a security guard attached to one of the outlets of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC Station, in Akure, the Ondo State capital. The gunmen were said to have stormed the filling state situated at
Onyearugbulem junction, Shagari Village area of the state capital in the early hours of Sunday. The 27-year-old guard, simply identified as Moses, was macheted on the head before he was shot dead. According to sources, the armed robbers overpowered the security guard, who was sleeping before they invaded the NNPC facility. One of the sources, who is an attendant in the filling station, stated that the amount carted away by the robbers was yet to be ascertained. She also said that the CCTV camera attached to the filling station was destroyed alongside other properties by the gunmen. “We just came to work as usual this morning, only for us to see that some people have burgled our filling station by forcefully gaining entrance. “We also noticed blood by the side of the station and saw the security guard (Moses) already dead and with his torchlight, so, we quickly raised the alarm. “The robbers broke the office of the Manager and destroyed the things inside the place. During the process of looking for money, they ransacked everywhere in the office,” he said. A resident in the area, who does not want his name mentioned, said the hoodlums must have entered silently into the petrol station to carry out the criminal act. Confirming the incident, the Police Public Relations Officer, Ondo State Command, PPRO, Femi Joseph, said that investigations have already commenced. Meanwhile, the corpse had been moved to the state specialists hospital in Akure by policemen from the homicide department of the Ondo State Police Command.
