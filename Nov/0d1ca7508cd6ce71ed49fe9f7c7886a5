Former Chelsea and Manchester United manager, Jose Mourinho, as revealed that Manchester City and Liverpool are ahead of their rivals in the English Premier League (EPL) because of the structures of the two clubs. Man City won the Premier League in the last two seasons, while Liverpool are currently in pole position to win the English top-flight league this campaign. Speaking on Liverpool and Man City’s impressive season so far, Mourinho told The Telegraph: “I think the structure of the clubs. “When you look at City, for example: the owner, Ferran Soriano [chief executive], Txiki Begiristain [director of football], Pep Guardiola, Pep’s staff and then the players. “This looks like harmony, empathy, chemistry, quality, sharing the same project, sharing the same ideas. “Liverpool? I also think that Jurgen [Klopp] is in a good position. He is very stable. “I think he has control of his ‘areas’. He is supported by people who think the same way, the structure of the club.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
