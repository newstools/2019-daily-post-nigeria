The Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, has reacted to the court ruling in favour of the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly, COZA, Pastor, Biodun Fatoyinbo on Thursday, stressing that they should reconcile. CAN lamented that the image of the church in Nigeria has been dented by the rape saga and the court proceedings. DAILY POST reported yesterday that Justice Oathman Musa of the Federal High Court in Abuja held that the matter against Fatoyinbo amounted to injustice and an abuse of judicial process. The judge held that the case was empty and purely sentimental. The judge further explained that the case was aimed more at cruelty than at obtaining justice. The court also awarded costs of N1m against Busola Dakolo and held that the fine should have been 10 times more because the court’s time was wasted. Busola, however, vowed to appeal the court’s decision. However, Pastor Bayo Oladeji, Media Aide to CAN President, Rev Samson Ayokunle, while speaking with Vanguard, said: “While we note that the image of the Nigerian Church and its leadership was dented before and during the court proceedings, CAN urges Pastor Fatoyinbo and Mrs Dakolo, to put away all that has transpired and reconcile. “The Church preaches forgiveness and reconciliation, and that is our position as the umbrella body of Christians in the country. “We begrudge neither Pastor Fatoyinbo nor Busola Dakolo, and urge them to extend a similar hand of love and fellowship to each other.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
