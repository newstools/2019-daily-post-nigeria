Former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, has lamented over the conduct of Kogi and Bayelsa State governorship elections. The election in both states were marred by violence, ballot box snatching. DAILY POST reports that the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, declared thirty of its ad hoc staff who participated in yesterday’s governorship election in Olamaboro Local Government Area (LGA), Kogi state, missing. The electoral body disclosed this early Sunday morning through the Local Government Area’s Electoral Officer in charge of collating and announcing results, Garba Mahmood. Mahmood said that the INEC ad-hoc workers were reported missing after some police officers raised concern that they were last seen shortly after voting ended at 2 p.m. Also, Senator Dino Melaye announced the death of his nephew, Olorunjuwon, who was shot by unknown gunmen at his polling unit during the Saturday’s election. Reacting, Fayose described the outcome of election in Kogi and Bayelsa States as a dark one for Nigeria and democracy. The former governor, however, warned those responsible for violence. Lamenting, Fayose warned that “the graveyard silence of Nigerians should not be mistaken for consent of these shenanigans.” Fayose on his Twitter page wrote: “Today is another sad and dark moment for our country and democracy going by the outcome of Kogi and Bayelsa election brazenly rigged in connivance with INEC and security agencies. “The graveyard silence of Nigerians should however not be mistaken for consent of these shenanigan, be warned!” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
