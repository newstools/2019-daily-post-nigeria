Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has failed to play down speculations linking him with the Bayern Munich job. The Bundesliga champions sacked Niko Kovac last week, following a 5-1 loss to Frankfurt on Saturday. Wenger has been linked with the vacant role, along with Jose Mourinho, Massimiliano Allegri and Ajax boss Erik ten Hag. When asked if he’d be interested in the Bayern Munich job, Wenger told beIN SPORTS: “I came here to speak about the games and you start very strongly there, putting me straight under pressure!” When pressed further on whether he misses management, he continued: “Of course! Coaching was my whole life until now and everybody who has coached will tell you the same. “You miss the intensity. There’s some things you miss a lot, and some things you don’t miss. So I enjoyed as well things I don’t miss too much. “But on the other hand, winning football games, preparing a team for a game, developing players and getting satisfaction and shared emotions is something that you miss. “So of course yes, I was responsible at 33 years of age and coached until 69 without interruption at top level. So that is 36 years without stopping. “So on the other hand, even if I miss it, to get a little bit out of that pressure for a year was not too bad for me – people who know me well say I’m more relaxed, it’s true!” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
