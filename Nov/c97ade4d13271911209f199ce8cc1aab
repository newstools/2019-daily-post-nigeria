Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has been given the backing of the board. The Gunners stretched their winless run in the Premier League to over a month, as they suffered a 2-0 defeat to Leicester on Saturday evening. The loss meant it was their worst start to a season since 1982. Emery has overseen five matches without a win, with their last victory coming against Vitoria in the Europa League on October 24. Also, their last Premier League three points, came in a narrow 1-0 victory over Bournemouth on October 6. But according to the Athletic, there are absolutely no plans to get rid of Emery, with Arsenal’s hierarchy, “100 per cent” behind the manager. Board members technical director Edu and Head of Football Raul Sanllehi were present at the King Power Stadium to watch the game. But despite being completely outplayed by the Foxes, they were happy to report, “clear signs of improved performance” and are on the “right path” to the rest of the Arsenal top brass. It is also believed that the duo, plus owner Stan Kroenke, his son Josh and managing director Vinai Venkatesham, are all “firmly on the same page.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
