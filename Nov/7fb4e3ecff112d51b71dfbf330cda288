The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP’s candidate in the last governorship election in Plateau State, Lt. Gen. Jeremiah Useni (rtd), has rejected the verdict of the Appeal Court, which affirmed the victory of Governor Simon Lalong. DAILY POST reports that the 5-member panel of the appellate court, which upheld the decision of the Justice H.A. Suleman-led Governorship Election Petition Tribunal, ruled that Useni failed to prove his allegations of forgery and electoral irregularities against Lalong and INEC respectively. Useni had claimed that Lalong was not qualified to contest the election, having held three certificates with three different names and therefore guilty of forgery. He also claimed that the election was marred with malpractices and irregularities. But the panel, in its judgment, declared Lalong winner of that election on the ground that Useni and PDP “could not prove the allegations of forgery against Lalong nor the allegations of electoral irregularities against INEC”. “This appeal has therefore failed in its entirety and judgment is hereby entered in favour of the 2nd respondent (Lalong),” the panel declared. However, speaking shortly after the judgment, Mr. Edward Pwajok (SAN), one of Useni’s Counsels, told newsmen that “our client has instructed us to appeal this judgment of the appellate court at the Supreme Court. “It is our conviction that we shall succeed with our appeal at the Supreme Court and reclaim the stolen mandate of our client,” NAN quoted Pwajok as saying.
