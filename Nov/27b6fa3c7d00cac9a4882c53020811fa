Abba Moro, Senator representing Benue South Senatorial District, on Thursday, congratulated the State Governor, Samuel Ortom, on his victory at the Appeal Court. Moro also congratulated the people of the state and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, over what he termed “resounding victory.” DAILY POST had reported that the Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja on Thursday upheld the election of Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State. The court dismissed the appeal filed by the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate in the poll, Emmanuel Jime, for lacking in merit. The court also awarded the sum of N150,000 fine against Jime. However, Moro, in a statement signed by his spokesperson, Godwin Ameh, said the verdict of the “Appellate Court, which upheld the election of Governor Ortom is a testament to the fact that no man can give power except God.” The terse statement reads: “The Judgment has further confirmed that Governor Samuel Ortom was overwhelmingly voted for by the people of the state during the last governorship election, and cannot be uprooted through the backdoor. “The Comrade Senator lauds the Judiciary for a sound Judgment, which has further shown that the people of Benue State freely gave Governor Ortom their support in the last election. “The Senator calls on those aggrieved over the outcome of the election and the various courts judgments to bury the past and join hands with Governor Ortom to work for a better Benue. “The Senator will continue to work with Governor Ortom to take Benue State to greater heights.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
