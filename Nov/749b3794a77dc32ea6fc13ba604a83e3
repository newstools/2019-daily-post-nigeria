The Bayelsa State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has reacted to the disqualification of its Deputy Governorship Candidate, Senator Biabarakuma Degi by the Federal High Court. DAILY POST had reported that the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on Tuesday disqualified the Deputy governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the November 16, 2019 governorship election in Bayelsa State. The court disqualified Senator Biobarakuma over false information in his CF0001 form submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commissioner (INEC) to contest the election Reacting, the Party’s Publicity Secretary, Doifie Buokoribo, in a statement on Tuesday described the judgement as ‘dead on arrival.’ Buokoribo said, “The judgement occasioned a miscarriage of justice; it is glaringly perverse and against the weight of evidence before the Court. “We are totally surprised that the Court could despite the objections by our lawyers, go ahead to determine a weighty criminal allegation of falsification and fraud solely on the bases of affidavit evidence contrary to well established judicial precedents that such must be proved beyond reasonable doubt by calling oral evidence. “We strongly believe that the judgment can not withstand a superior judicial scrutiny, therefore, our lawyers have filed a notice of appeal and other court processes to arrest the execution of the judgment pending the outcome of the appeal. “We call on all our members and supporters not to be distracted but continue to peacefully mobilize for the November 16, 2019 elections.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
