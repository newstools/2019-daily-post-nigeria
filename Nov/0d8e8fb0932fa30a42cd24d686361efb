Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has reacted to his side’s Premier League 1-0 defeat to West Ham United on Saturday. A second half goal from Aaron Cresswell ensured Manuel Pellegrini’s men defeated Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. “Generally, collectively we could have handled that game better,” Lampard was quoted by Football London as saying at his post-match press conference. “This isn’t the worst thing for us as long as we react in the right way. “There will be moments like this. We weren’t going to be Invincibles, we have to pass little tests. We can do more going forward.” Lampard added: “It will pan out itself over the course of the season. I still believe in the squad. That will be questions that will be asked. I do believe in the squad. “There isn’t a time for harsh reactions or judgements. It is a look for a bit of character.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
