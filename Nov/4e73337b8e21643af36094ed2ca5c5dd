The balkanization of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus of the House of Representatives today took another turn as the House ordered its Ethics and Privileges committee to investigate Kingsley Chinda for impersonating the minority leader. The committee also has the mandate to probe Chukwuma Onyeama, Yakubu Barde and Muraina Ajibola, all of whom emerged as PDP consensus leadership candidates during the minority leadership tussle. The resolution followed a motion on Privilege moved by Ben Igbakpa during plenary on Wednesday. Igbakpa in his motion accused Kingsley Chinda of impersonating the minority leadership. According to Igbakpa, the four individuals “issued a press statement on behalf of the PDP caucus, one of the statement was published on Daily Trust.” The matter was referred to the committee on ethics and privilege by the Presiding Officer, Idris Wase. Chinda in his response said that he is the recognized leader of the PDP caucus. In a press statement made available to journalists, Chinda said that he has the mandate of his party. “I am the PDP Caucus leader in the House with the authority and consent of the party. “PDP is a registered political party and a creation of law and not the rules of the House. PDP has its leaders in units, communities, amongst students, traders, Professionals and parliamentarians. These leaders are recognised by the party as such. “I have the mandate of the PDP to act as its leader in the House. “Other minority parties are free to have their caucus leadership. I don’t see how that offends the rule or law of the House or the constitution. “ Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
