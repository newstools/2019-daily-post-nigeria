Manchester City winger, Raheem Sterling, will not sign a new deal, unless manager Pep Guardiola commits his long-term future to the club, according to The Sun. Sterling, who has played the best football of his career under the Spaniard, has entered the last 18 months of his current contract. City are keen to begin talks over fresh terms and will reportedly go as high as £450,000 a week. However, Sterling would follow Guardiola out, if he decides to leave The Etihad. The England international has struck a deep bond with the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss since he arrived at the club. In the Catalan’s first season, Sterling managed just 10 goals. But the 24-year-old bagged 23 in the 2017-18 campaign, 25 last season and 14 so far in this one.
