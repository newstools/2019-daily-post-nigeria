Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane has hailed winger, Gareth Bale for his brilliant display in the Los Blancos’ 3-1 win over Real Sociedad in the La Liga on Saturday night. Zidane also urged the club’s supporters to start backing Bale and stop booing the Welsh international. Bale’s commitment to Real Madrid has come under the microscope this week after he helped his country qualified for Euro 2020. The former Tottenham Hotspur star joined his country’s teammates dancing after their qualification alongside a banner saying “Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order”. “There is too much noise with Bale, he wants to be here and do as well as he can, that’s why we don’t want to talk too much about this. He is integrated into the group and he wants to play well, just like everyone else,” Zidane told reporters at his post-match press conference. “I hope this doesn’t continue throughout the season. We want the fans to be with us from the start of the game to the end but we can’t control this. The fans have a right to do what they want but I ask them to support everyone.” Zidane added: “Real Madrid supporters have booed all of the very best players and Bale put in a good display when he came on. He just needs to focus on working hard on the pitch. “It’s not about whether I understand the boos or not, we need our fans on our side and so does Gareth, just like every other player. “If that happens we can move on from this. We want the fans to applaud him, like they did after the goal.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
