Two persons, Oyetola Ogungbemi and Damilola Tolorunlase have appeared before an Akure Magistrate Court for allegedly stealing goods worth N3.6 million. 30-year-old Ogungbemi and Toorunlase, 25, were arraigned before Chief Magistrate Charity Adeyanju on three counts charge of conspiracy and theft. It was gathered that the duo committed the offence at No 28, Town Planning Office, Shagari Village, Akure, the Ondo State capital when they carted away the goods belonging to one Kikelomo Ajibola. Among the goods, which the defendants were accused to have stolen included; 70 cartons of Praise Jah Blood Tonic valued at N1,848,000; 50 cartons of Akanvic Herbal mixture valued at N450,000; 50 cartons of Atomobi valued at N450,000, 20 cartons of Toothache valued N560,000, 20 cartons of Yoldyn valued at N332,000, total valued at N3,640,000. The crime was said to be contrary to sections 383 and 516 of the Criminal Code Cap. 37 Volume 1, Laws of Ondo State of Nigeria, 2006. However, the first defendant, Oyetola Ogungbemi pleaded not guilty to the charge while the second defendant, Tolorunlase Damilola pleaded guilty to the first count of conspiracy and not guilty to the second and third count of stealing. Counsel to the second defendant, Adewunmi prayed the court to allows his client to change her plea to the first count. Adewunmi submitted that his client pleaded guilty because she did not understand English which was used to read the charge. Chief Magistrate, Charity Adeyanju, however, discountenanced the counsel’s plea, stating that the defendant was asked the language she understood best before the charge was read to her. The prosecuting counsel, Inspector Uloh Goodluck, informed the court that he has four witnesses with a request for an adjournment to enable him to assemble all his witnesses and study the case file. The first defence counsel, Mr. Ogungbemi, however, did not object the application but prayed the court to grant the first defendant bail in very liberal terms. Magistrate Adeyanju subsequently granted the first defendant bail of N500,000 and one surety in like sum. She adjourned the case till December 11 and 12, for hearing, December 13 and 14, for defence and December 15, for judgement.
