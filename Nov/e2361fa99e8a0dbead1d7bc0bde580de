Vitoria will host Arsenal in their Europa League clash on Wednesday. The game in Portugal has been fixed for a 4:50 pm kick-off (West African time) and is not taking place on the traditional Thursday slot. The move comes due to the close proximity of Guimaraes to Braga, who are hosting Besiktas in the competition on Thursday night. Unai Emery’s men won the reverse 3-2, with Nicolas Pepe smashing in two late free-kicks. Arsenal XI to face Vitoria SC: Martinez, Sokratis, Holding, Mustafi, Maitland-Niles, Ceballos, Willock, Tierney, Pepe, Martinelli, Saka Vitoria XI vs Arsenal: Douglas Jesus, Garcia, Frederico Venancio, Tapsoba, Rafa Soares, Pepe, Agu, Evangelista, Edwards, Duarte, Davidson.
