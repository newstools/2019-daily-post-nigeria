The National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has reacted to the political development in Edo State. It disclosed that it had set up a committee to look into the face-off. APC said it was deeply disturbed by the recent turn of events inspite of the various steps the party had taken to find an amicable resolution. Within the last 24 hours, factions of the state chapter had suspended the National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole and Governor Godwin Obaseki. In a statement on Wednesday, Lanre Issa-Onilu, APC National Publicity Secretary, recalled that leaders such as the Chairman, Nigerian Governors’ Forum (NGF) and Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi; Chairman, Progressives Governors’ Forum (PGF) and Governor of Kebbi State, Abubakar Bagudu, and other eminent party leaders, had all tried at various times to ensure that the issues do not escalate. “Sadly, these interventions have not yielded the desirable results”, it added. “However, the immediate concern of the NWC is how to ensure that unity returns to the ranks of the party in Edo State. “In achieving this, we have decided to constitute a high-power fact-finding and reconciliation committee of party leaders to meet with all disputing parties to ensure that all issues are addressed and resolved”.
