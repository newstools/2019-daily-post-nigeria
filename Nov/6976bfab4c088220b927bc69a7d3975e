Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has officially approved the payment of N35,000 new minimum wage to workers under government’s employment beginning from this month. The approval was contained in a circular issued by the Head of Service, Hakeem Muri-Okunola on Wednesday. The circular stated that Sanwo-Olu, in his determination to improve the welfare and wellbeing of public servants in Lagos State, has graciously approved the implementation of the new minimum wage with effect from 1st November, 2019. The HOS said the salaries for the month of November was being delayed beyond the usual 23rd day cycle in order to adequately process payment of the new minimum wage. He said government had agreed to pay GL. 01-06=N35,000.09;. GL. 07=30%; GL. 08-10=25%; GL. 12-14=22.5% and GL. 15-17=20%. According to Muri-Okunola, “kindly note that the payment of salaries for the month of November 2019 is delayed beyond the usual 23rd day cycle in order to adequately process payment of the new minimum wage. The consequential increase of the new minimum wage in Lagos State for Senior and Management grade level is as follows: GL. 07=30%; GL. 08-10=25%; GL. 12-14=22.5% and GL. 15-17=20%. “Accordingly, it should be noted that that approved minimum wage and consequential adjustments are more than the federal government’s approved recommendation, which further demonstrates this administration’s commitment to staff welfare.” He, therefore, enjoined public servants to show more commitment, dedication and selflessness in the delivery of qualitative service to Lagosians. “By this action, public servant are thus enjoined to show more commitment, dedication and selflessness in the delivery of qualitative service to the citizens of Lagos State, whose fulfillment of tax obligations largely contribute to payment of these salaries. “In addition, public servants are expected to give unalloyed support to the state government’s agenda, as we collectively strive to actualise set goals,” he said.
