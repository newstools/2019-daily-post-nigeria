Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, on Wednesday met with Premier League officials, to discuss potential improvements to the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system, Sky Sports reports. The Premier League’s head of football relations Simon Morgan and director of football, Richard Garlick, travelled to Manchester to meet with the Norwegian. Solskjaer had to move the meeting by one day, because of their Europa League fixture against Partizan Belgrade at Old Trafford. He will be absent when referees chief, Mike Riley, meets with top-flight managers based in the north of England on Thursday. So far, United have avoided being on the wrong end of any controversial VAR decisions. They were given two penalties against Norwich after VAR checks, while Marcus Rashford’s goal against Liverpool was allowed to stand, after VAR deemed there was no foul on Divock Origi in the build-up.
