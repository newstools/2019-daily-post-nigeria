Harry Kane, on Thursday, became England’s all-time highest scoring starting captain, after netting a hat-trick against Montenegro on Thursday. The Three Lions have all but booked their place in next summer’s European Championships, following a 7-0 win at Wembley. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain opened the scoring after 11 minutes, before Kane grabbed his first goal in the 18th minute. The Tottenham striker doubled his account in the 24th minute, before Marcus Rashford made it four on the half-hour mark. Kane completed his hat-trick with a tidy finish as the half-time whistle approached. He also becomes the first player to score a hat-trick in successive appearances at Wembley, having also scored a treble against Bulgaria on September 7.
