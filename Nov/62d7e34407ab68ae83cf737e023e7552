Thierry Henry has vowed to bounce back from his bad spell in charge of Monaco, after he was unveiled as the new manager on Montreal Impact on Monday. Henry has signed a two-year contract and is tasked with dragging the club out of mid-table obscurity. The former Arsenal striker was handed his second opportunity in the hot seat with the MLS club, despite his failings at his boyhood side in France. “You have to start somewhere. That’s how you acquire experience. For me it came with Belgium and Monaco, where I learned a lot about myself. “It’s about fighting. This isn’t just my story but the story of everyone in life. Everyone falls. It’s about how you get up. “It didn’t work out in Monaco (as a coach). I can give you a lot of excuses but at the end of the day it didn’t work out and I am here as a coach of Montreal. “I learned a lot there. The only mistake you can make is not learning from what happened. You have to confront it,” he said at the press conference. The former Arsenal striker added: “The face of a team is often a reflection of the coach, but I want the community, the players to feel what’s going on in this city. Finance is not a problem. In this league, winning teams do not always have money.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
