The suspension, which is for 30 days, in the first instance, according to a statement by the Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Simon Uchenna Ortuanya, was in the interest of peace, order and good governance and in compliance with Section 10 (b) of the Traditional Rulers Law, Cap 151 Revised Laws of Enugu State, 2004.
