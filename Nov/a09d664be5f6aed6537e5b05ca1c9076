The manager of Chelsea Football Club, Frank Lampard, has expressed satisfaction with the way his team played against Crystal Palace on Saturday. Chelsea had on Saturday defeated Crystal Palace 2-0 to climb to the second place on the English Premiership table. However, Lampard while addressing a post-match press conference, said he was happy with the way the team started both halves of the game. Lampard said it was a difficult decision putting “Reece James in for the in-form Cesar Azpilicueta because of everything our captain offers on and off the pitch, but he feels vindicated by the youngster’s performance on what was his full Premier League debut.” According to Lampard: “It was a nice solid win with a clean sheet. “I was delighted with our game management, and I got as much joy out of Zouma and Tomori’s performances in defence, and the midfielders shielding in front of them, as I did our attacking play.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
