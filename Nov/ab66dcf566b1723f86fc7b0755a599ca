The accused persons are Dr Aisosa Amadasun, Adams Osabuohien, Prince Stephen Alao, Dove Momodu and Mallam Ali Sulayman. The court however, granted the accused persons’ bail on 13 October 2017. Justice Ohimai, however, foreclosed witness hearing schedules for today and adjourned to December 13 for definite hearing. Counsel to the 3rd and 4th defendants, Barr.
