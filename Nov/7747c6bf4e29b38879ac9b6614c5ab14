Super Eagles head coach, Gernot Rohr has disclosed that his side is not the best team in Africa because it still has a lot of work to do. He also warned his players to stay humble when they tackle Lesotho in today’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier at the Setsoto Stadium. Rohr’s men head to the game following a 2-1 victory over Benin Republic in their last encounter. ”I am calm because they played well in the second half against Benin, but you never know in the next match (against Lesotho), they must stay humble,” Rohr told reporters in his pre-match press conference ahead of Nigeria’s clash with Lesotho. ”Like I told them after the Brazil game, don’t believe you are the best team in Africa because you held Brazil to a draw, there’s still a lot of work to do. ”I am not excited, I’ll be excited if we win the AFCON for example.” The kick-off time for the match is 5pm.
