Chelsea have set a £5million asking price for Olivier Giroud, ahead of the January transfer window, the Daily Express reports. Giroud moved to Stamford Bridge from Arsenal last year and won the FA Cup and Europa League with the Blues. However, the 33-year-old has endured a frustrating spell and is behind Tammy Abraham in Frank Lampard’s pecking order. As a result, the France forward has been repeatedly linked with a move away from west London, with the likes of Inter Milan and Crystal Palace interested. Giroud is, “frustrated” at Stamford Bridge and is open to leaving Chelsea, who will demand a £5m fee to sanction his departure.
