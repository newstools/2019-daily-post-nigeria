Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has said he wants to win the Champions League, for the third time in his career. Mourinho’s second game in charge of Spurs is the group game with Olympiacos, where a point will send them through to the knockout stages for a third successive year. The Portuguese have previously won the competition with FC Porto and Inter Milan. “I love the competition as much as everyone in football. “It’s something that everybody dreams about, to win it. “Not everyone has the privilege to be a Champions League winner, which I was happy enough to do twice. “Do I want to win it a third time? Of course, I would love it but I know the difficulties of it. “But with these boys, I will never be afraid of any Champions League match that comes into our faces. “I repeat, we need to qualify, that is the focus. I always say that. “We have to qualify, but, as I was saying, give me time to work, give me time to float my ideas with these boys and I will have no problem at all going to any stadium at all to face any big opponent in Europe or in England. “We are not going to be afraid of anybody,” Mourinho told a press conference on Monday.
