Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chuks Ibegbu, has called on the federal government to reconsider its stand on border closure as the pain Nigerians were undergoing presently outweighs the gain of the closure. He noted that security agents were the beneficiaries of the policy and like the Apapa gridlock would make it fail. Ibegbu, who spoke in a telephone interview with DAILY POST on Monday night, regretted that the exercise was being abused by customs senior officers and security agents. “Most borders in the North are still porous and more efforts should be made to halt the entry into our country by foreign herdsmen and others that infiltrate to cause havoc in the country.” The Ohanaeze spokesman also warned all stakeholders in Nigeria against the politicisation of the next census exercise in Nigeria. Ibegbu noted that Nigeria have not had any credible census exercise since independence as he claimed that the past census were politicised. He said, “Census is for national development and not for politics and political advantage.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
