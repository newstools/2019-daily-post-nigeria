The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has denied commencing the sale of application forms for the 2020/2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). The board’s Head of Media, Dr Fabian Benjamin, made this known while speaking with NAN on Friday in Abuja. Benjamin explained that the board was still in the process of admissions and so had not commenced the sale of any form. “There’s a guideline being circulated presently that the board will soon commence the sale of its 2020 UTME forms in January, while others even said it had commenced already. “This is not true because we have not rolled out our forms for sale yet; admissions into tertiary institutions are still ongoing and have not closed yet because we work with a calendar. “Nigerians should disregard all that is presently being circulated, it is all the antics of fraudsters who want to hoodwink unsuspecting public and dupe them of their hard earned income. “When we commence the sale, we have our official channels like our Twitter handle to pass the information and would also advertise to let the public be aware,” he said. Benjamin also noted that JAMB was still in talks with the National Identification Management Commission (NIMC), over the plan for prospective applicants to acquire a National Identification Number (NIN), before registering for the examination.
