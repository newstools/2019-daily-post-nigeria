Super Eagles’ head coach, Gernot Rohr on Wednesday said winning the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) for Nigeria would make him the most excited person. He also blamed his players for not taking their goal-scoring chances during the game. Rohr spoke at a post-match conference in Uyo after his team came from behind to defeat the Squirrels of Benin Republic 2-1. “It will be exciting for me to win the 2021 AFCON title with Nigeria. That’s my desire, and I will be the most excited. “So, winning today (Wednesday) is just the beginning. I can’t be excited until we win the title in 2021,” he said. Rohr also said Benin Republic have a good team, noting that the Nigerian side had a good game in the second half. “The Super Eagles had a lot of scoring opportunities, but they failed to convert all of them.” He, however, pointed out that the game’s opening goal, scored by the Squirrels’ captain, Stephane Sessegnon, in the match’s second minute, was a big shock. “In the second half, we played a very good match, ‘one-touch two-touch’, and we have good wingers. We had a lot of opportunities, and with the changes we made, we did very well. It is good for us.” Rohr also said he could not use home-based players for now in the Nigerian team due to specific reasons “At the moment, the quality we have from abroad is higher than what we have in the home league (Nigeria Professional Football League),” he said.
