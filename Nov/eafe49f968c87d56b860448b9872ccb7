A burial ceremony almost turned violent when two opposing families from the Oruwari Briggs clashed in Abonnema, Akuku-Toru Local government area of Rivers State. DAILY POST reports that while sympathizers were witnessing the Lying-in State of Late Chief Ibim Iyibo Briggs, some errant kinsmen stormed the venue and tore the clothing of the deceased. It was a classic case of utter disrespect to the dead. The angry youths who are from a rival family laying claim to the Chieftaincy Stool occupied by Late Chief Iyibo-Briggs stormed the spot where the body of the lifeless Chief was lying and tore his clothes. The youths said since Late Iyibo-Briggs was not a recognised Chief, he should not be ardoned in a Chieftaincy attire and should not be buried as such. The incident left many guests scampering for safety for fear that the situation may escalate. One of the guests, Mary Itubo told newsmen that, “I have never seen such an incident before. That people will come and attempt to strip a dead body because of Chieftaincy tussle. “The way they came, we thought they were also coming to sympathize, only for one of them to grab the corpse’s clothes and tore it. He was so angry, he was questioning why Chief Iyibo Briggs should be dressed like that.” “They were saying he was not their Chief and should not have been treated like their Chief. I think the matter is still in court. But my women group left when the incident was happening because these boys are not predictable,” she said.
