The National Youths Service Corps, NYSC, Area Coordinator, South-West, Mr Emmanuel Attach, has warned corps members to stop embarking on unauthorised journeys to avoid unpleasant experiences during their service year. Attah on Saturday advised corps members to stop “gallivanting around when he paid a courtesy visit to the Oyo State NYSC Permanent Orientation Camp, Iseyin. The official said that most of the deaths recorded among corps members happened during road accidents and advised that they settle down at their various places of primary assignment. According to him, if they must travel, they should, first of all, obtain permission following the laid down procedure by the scheme. Attah assured the corps members that if found to be genuine, permission would be granted for them to travel. The area coordinator praised the corps members for their discipline and behavior since the beginning of the Orientation Course. He urged them to be good ambassadors of the scheme and to avoid spreading fake news through the social media. “It will be recalled that lately the National Youth Service Corps established six area offices all over the country in a bid to decentralise its operations for effective monitoring and supervision of corps members. “Each of them is located in a particular geopolitical zone of the country and all the states in a particular zone are under the supervision of the Area Coordinator,” he said.
