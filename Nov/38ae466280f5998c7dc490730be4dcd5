The Peoples Democratic Party in Ekiti State has commended the judiciary for upholding the victory of the party’s candidate, Sen Biodun Olujimi in the last senatorial election. PDP said that the judgment of both the lower tribunal and the appeal court did not come as a surprise because the result declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission did not reflect the true vote cast in the first instance. In a statement by the PDP Publicity Secretary in the State, Mr Jackson Adebayo, the Party berated INEC for colluding with the All Progressives Congress to steal the mandate which was given to Sen olujimi and PDP at the poll without minding the Democratic consequences on the nation. The Party, however, gave kudos to the judiciary for righting the wrong appropriately by declaring Sen olujimi and PDP as the authentic winner of the National Assembly election. “We congratulate all members of our Party in the State and particularly congratulate Sen Biodun Olujimi for her courage to fight the battle to a victorious logical conclusion . ” The Party urge all the leaders as well as members of the Party to see this victory as that of God, hence the need to cooperate to move the Party forward. “We want to assure all our members that with the victory of Sen. Olujimi there is a great future for the Party, what we just need is to walk in unison towards subsequent elections in the State “ Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
