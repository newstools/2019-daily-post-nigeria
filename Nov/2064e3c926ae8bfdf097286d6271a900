Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State has ordered the implementation of N30,000 new national minimum wage in the state. A statement by the Director of Media and Communications, Solomon Kumangar, said the governor directed that the new wage must take effect from this month, November 2019. The statement reads, “Governor Ahmadu Fintiri has directed that payment of the new national minimum wage should commence from November 2019. “This order covers state civil servants as well as local government employees.” This would cheer the state civil servants, although it is expected, as Governor Fintiri had always assured that the new national minimum wage would be implemented once the federal government concluded discussions on consequential adjustments.
