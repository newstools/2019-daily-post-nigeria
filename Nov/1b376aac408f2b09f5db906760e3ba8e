Liverpool legend, Phil Thompson has revealed that manager, Jurgen Klopp’s wife, Ulla prevented the Reds boss from joining Manchester United in 2015 during his time with Borussia Dortmund. Thompson said Ulla told Klopp that a move to the Red Devils would not be right before she approved of his switch to Liverpool in 2015. Speaking with TV2 in Denmark, Thompson said: “I interviewed Klopp for Sky, and I asked if he and Liverpool were created for each other. He looked at me and asked “Why?” “Then Klopp told me he could have taken over Manchester United, but his wife said it wasn’t right. “When Liverpool arrived, his wife said it was right. There is something strange there. It is as if he’s created for Liverpool.” Thompson added: “In my time we always lost three to four games [at this stage of the season], but this team leads by nine points and lost only one game last season. “This season they have beaten everyone, except for a draw at Old Trafford. They are doing something great.” Klopp won successive Bundesliga titles with Dortmund and also took them to the UEFA Champions League final during his time with the German giants.
