Former Manchester United star, Gary Neville has slammed midfielders, Fred and Andreas Pereira following their display in the Red Devils’ 3-3 draw against Sheffield United on Sunday. He also urged Man United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to sign three experienced players in the January transfer window. “Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has to go and spend the club’s money in January for himself. He has to go and spend the club’s money on two or three experienced players – he must demand it,” Neville said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football. “Those young lads, he’s not gonna be there to see the fruits of the labour that he’s putting in, the foundations that he’s lying because there’s a lot of good young players out on that pitch. “But unless they get the players in and around them quickly, they’ll not see the standard and they won’t have the maturity. Neville added: “Fred and Pereira is not a midfield for a mid-table club, let alone one of the top spending clubs in Europe. “They have got injury problems and other issues in midfield.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
