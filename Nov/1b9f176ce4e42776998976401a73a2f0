Head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr has explained why he started Rangers star, Joe Aribo in Nigeria’s 2-1 win over Benin Republic in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, qualifier encounter on Wednesday. Rohr, who had hinted before the match that Aribo would not be risked for the clash against the Squirrels due to travelling fatigue, said that the midfielder told him he was not tired after a long flight. Stephane Sessegnon latched on a defensive error to make it 1-0. Victor Osimhen made it 1-1 from the penalty spot, shortly before half time. Samuel Kalu grabbed the winner, with a fine solo goal. “Aribo told me he was not tired after a long flight, and I have confidence in my players when they tell me they are ready to play,” Rohr told reporters in his post-match press conference in Uyo. “Also his father was here and this his (Aribo’s) second time coming into the country, so it was important for him to play.” Nigeria will now take on Lesotho on Sunday in their next match.
