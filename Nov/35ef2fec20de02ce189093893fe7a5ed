Former Senate Minority Leader, Senator Godswill Akpabio, has reacted to his victory at the Appeal Court on Saturday. DAILY POST reports that the Court of Appeal sitting in Calabar, Cross River State, ruled in favour of Sen. Akpabio, of the All Progressives Congress, APC. The appellate court nullified the election of Dr. Chris Ekpenyong, of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, who was declared winner of the February 23, 2019 National Assembly election in Akwa Ibom North West Senatorial District. The court also ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to withdraw the Certificate of Return issued to Dr. Ekpenyong and conduct fresh election in the Akwa Ibom North West Senatorial District within 90 days. Akpabio in a swift reaction on his Twitter page, said the judgement was a victory for democracy. He said, “Today’s Appeal Court Judgement is a victory for democracy. Let me say that, I am grateful to God and my people for always standing by me. “I will never take your support for granted.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
