Former Manchester United striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s next possible club after leaving LA Galaxy last Wednesday has been revealed. DAILY POST recalls that Ibrahimovic mutually parted ways with LA Galaxy following a two-year stint with the MLS club. However, Bologna director of sport, Riccardo Bigon believes the relationship between Ibrahimovic and manager, Sinisa Mihailjovic is key to luring the 38-year-old Swedish star to the club in January. According to Bigon, Ibrahimovic has said he’s open to joining his team next year. “There is only a month-and-a-half to the opening of the transfer window,” Bigon told Sky Sport Italia. “Ibrahimovic and the coach have a really strong personal relationship. He has told us that he is open to the idea of joining Bologna. “We are fascinated by the idea of him coming to the Stadio Dall’Ara, but it is very clear that we don’t control the situation. “The choice is down to the player, so we wait, and in case the player gives his OK, then we will be ready. Ibra will take his time to evaluate the offers after announcing his farewell to MLS.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
