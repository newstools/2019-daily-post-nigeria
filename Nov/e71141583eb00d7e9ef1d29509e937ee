Former Chelsea captain, John Terry, blocked the West London club from signing Manchester City star, Sergio Aguero. According to The Athletic, Terry advised Chelsea against signing Aguero when the Blues were working on a deal to bring the striker to Stamford Bridge two years before he joined Man City in 2011 from Atletico Madrid. The newspaper reports that the ex-defender was not a huge fan of the Argentina international having played against him twice in the UEFA Champions League. Terry also suggested that Chelsea’s hierarchy should sign striker, David Villa from Valencia at the time ahead of Aguero. Aguero has been impressive for Man City since his move to Etihad from Atletico. He has scored 173 goals for Pep Guardiola’s side and helped them to win four Premier League titles.
