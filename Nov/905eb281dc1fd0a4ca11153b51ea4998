National Coordinator, Rotary International Project on National Family Planning Campaign, Professor Dolapo Lufadeju has declared that Nigeria is losing 68,000 women yearly as a result of pregnancy and child birth complications. Lufadeju disclosed this on Thursday during the South West family planning Campaign project in Ibadan. He said that the number represent 23 per cent of the entire world death as a result of pregnancy and child birth complications. “This implies that for every 5 women that died as a result of pregnancy and child birth, one is a Nigerian and this is scaring and Roatary International was upset about it. “Rotary International being an organisation with national network of volunteers to be able to mobilise and create awareness in communities, will do community dialogue, training among others to reduce maternal and child birth mortality. “We are in South West for the meeting to bring stakeholders together to plan and strategise on steps to be taken in the next three years in order to reduce maternal and child birth death,” he said. Lufadeju said that the club is partnering with the Society of Gynecologist and Obstetrics of Nigeria (SOGON) and Ministry of Health to achieve this objective. “We will deploy the zeal, commitment and with rotary standard, we are going to innovate and propose solution to the challenges. “We are going to do advocacy in the community, with traditional rulers, political leaders, religious leaders, train doctors among others. “Our aim is to reduce maternal death and everyone has to know that the issue concerns us all”.
