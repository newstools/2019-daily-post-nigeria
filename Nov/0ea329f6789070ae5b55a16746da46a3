Edward Onoja, Deputy Governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kogi State has said that Yahaya Bello is ‘God-sent.’ Onoja said this on Saturday after voting at unit 13, ward 3, Omonyoku-Odidoko, Ogugu-Olamaboro Local Government Area of Kogi. The Deputy Governorship candidate said voters were eager to return Bello to office. According to him, Kogi residents will return Bello as their Governor because they want him to consolidate on his achievements. ”You can see the enthusiasm of the voters who want to usher in a government that will continue to consolidate on its gains in service delivery. ”God brought a divine leader who in spite of coming from another senatorial district saw the need to meet the infrastructural gap in the Eastern district that has always produced the governor of the state. ”Because of this, our people who are people of gratitude appreciate that gesture and then made up their mind to repay good for good. ”I think today at the end of the day, we will all be happy,” Onoja said.
