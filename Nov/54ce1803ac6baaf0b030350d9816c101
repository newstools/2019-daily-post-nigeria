An Upper Area Court sitting in Kasuwan Nama in Jos has sentenced a 30-year-old driver, Rabiu Mohammed, to five years in prison for stealing from an MTN mast. The Judge, Lawal Suleiman, however, gave him an option of N50, 000 fine NAN reports. Suleiman said the judgment would serve as a deterrent to those who would want to indulge in such a criminal act. The Prosecutor, Sgt. Ibrahim Gokwat told the court that the case was reported on Oct. 15, at the Laranto Police Station by a complainant Donfa Ponfa of Dadin Kowa, Jos. According to the prosecutor, the convict who resides at Angwan Rimi, Jos, was caught and arrested with 25 litres of diesel valued at N6, 600. “Other items include recovered were one 75 AMPS battery valued at N20, 000 and 8 pieces of BUB battery, value not yet known. He said, ‘‘the thief has been going there to steal but on this particular day when he broke in, he got caught and handed over to the police,’’ Gokwat said. On arraignment, the convict pleaded guilty to the offence and begged the court for leniency. The prosecutor said the offence was contrary to Section 271 and punishable under Section 272 of the Plateau Penal Code law.
