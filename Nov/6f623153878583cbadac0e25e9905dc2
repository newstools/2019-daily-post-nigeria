President Muhammadu Buhari’s Personal Assistant on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, has pointed out reasons why the Chairman of Air Peace, Allen Onyema evacuated Nigerians who were stranded in South Africa during the xenophobic attack. Onochie claimed that Onyema had an ulterior motive when he evacuated stranded Nigerians in South Africa free of charge. In a series of tweets, the presidential aide said she was not fooled by Onyema’s “heroism” because she knew something was up, adding that the Air Peace boss knew America had him where they wanted him. She tweeted: “When the scales suddenly fall off their eyes, we must give it time because it’s either they are pursuing something or something is pursuing them. “When AirPeace Proprietor became a “Hero”, I was not fooled. Something was pursuing him. He knew America had him where they wanted him.” DAILY POST reports that Onyeama was charged with bank fraud and money laundering for moving more than $20 million from Nigeria through United States bank accounts in a scheme involving false documents based on the purchase of air-planes. The US State Department of Justice (DoJ), in a statement posted on its website on Friday, said Air Peace Chief of Administration and Finance, Ejiroghene Eghagha, has also been charged with bank fraud and committing aggravated identity theft in connection with the scheme. But, reacting, Onyeama said all money transferred to the US went through the CBN, adding that the allegations were false and are in no way in line with his character as a person and as a businessman.
