Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has singled out the performances of Anthony Martial and Brandon Williams, following their 3-1 victory over Brighton on Sunday. Andreas Pereira, Marcus Rashford and a Davy Propper own goal, ensured the Red Devils picked up three points at Old Trafford. The winlifted United up to seventh and speaking to BBC Sport, Solskjaer insisted that his team could have scored more on the day. “We should have scored many more goals. “It was an excellent performance from the lads, when you see them going forward it is a joy to watch. “Anthony Martial did not get a goal but he was outstanding. Brandon Williams was excellent too, he has had some good games already and he seems he wants to be out there and enjoy himself,” Solskjaer said.
