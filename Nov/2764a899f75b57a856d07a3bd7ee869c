Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has reacted to the judgment of the Court of Appeal which affirmed his re-election. DAILY POST had reported that the Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja on Thursday upheld the election of Governor Ortom and dismissed the appeal filed by the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate in the poll, Emmanuel Jime, for lacking in merit. The court also awarded the sum of N150,000 fine against Jime. Reacting, Ortom in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, commended the judgement and described it as a victory for the people of the state. According to him, the appellate court’s verdict has not only validated the earlier judgment of the Governorship Election Tribunal but also confirmed the choice of Benue voters in the 2019 polls. He thanked God for giving him the opportunity to lead the state for another term and appreciated the leadership and members of the PDP in the state, as well as the people of the state. Governor Ortom also commended his legal team for their outstanding performance at the Tribunal and the Court of Appeal and stressed that the task of building the state was the responsibility of all the people. He, however, called on the APC candidate and other contestants in the last election to join hands with him to develop Benue State. Ortom also expressed willingness to collaborate with sons and daughters of the state irrespective of political differences, ethnicity, religion and place of origin, for a greater Benue.
