Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, was full of praise for three debutants, despite their 2-1 defeat to Astana on Thursday. Solskjaer handed out seven debuts in the Europa League clash in Kazakhstan. Jesse Lingard gave United the lead, but they were pegged back by the hosts before Di’Shon Bernard turned into his own net. But Solskjaer was impressed by the 19-year-old defender, along with fellow new boys Dylan Levitt and Ethan Laird. “The performance was very good. At times we were excellent and in short spells, we let them push us back,” Solskjaer told BT Sport. “That cost us in the end because there was a 10-minute spell in the second half that they grew in the game. “You want the boys to learn from this – maybe stay down for two minutes and let us get organised. “You have to put them on the pitch before you know if they are good enough. “The full debuts from Ethan, DiShaun and Dylan. I thought all three of them were excellent.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
