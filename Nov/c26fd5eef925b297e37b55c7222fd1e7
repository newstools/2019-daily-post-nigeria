Mr Abba Shehu-Umar, the Personal Secretary to the emir disclosed this in a statement issued on Monday in Maiduguri The emir lamented the increase in number of commercial sex workers, despite clamp down on illegal brothels and commercial sex workers at Galadima area of Maiduguri. The emir warned that those found to be engaging in the act or other forms of criminality would be prosecuted, while their premises would be demolished in accordance with the state government’s policy on such illegal structures in Maiduguri. The statement read in part: “My emirate would not condone illicit activities and other forms of criminality allegedly perpetrated by the sex workers. “You may recall that these girls caused serious criminality in the suburb of the state capital, they engaged in open prostitution, child trafficking, drug abuse and other forms of criminality in the metropolis. “The state government constituted a high powered committee to address the nefarious activities, which led to the demolishing of several hotels, brothels and hideouts in Maiduguri. “Now that their chances in the state capital are narrowing, they are exploring other places in the local government councils. “The trend cannot be accepted; I have instructed Village and Ward Heads to be vigilant and proactive as such attitude will not be condoned,” El-Kanemi was quoted as saying in the statement.
