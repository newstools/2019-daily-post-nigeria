Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has tipped Virgil van Dijk, to win the 2019 Ballon D’Or award next Monday, although he admitted Lionel Messi is the best player of this generation. Van Dijk is one of the favourites for the award, after being named UEFA’s best player. Messi, however, remains firmly in contention for a sixth Ballon d’Or, though he had won FIFA’s The Best award in September ahead of the Reds defender. “If you give the Ballon d’Or to the best player of this generation then you should give it always to Lionel Messi. That’s how it is. “But if you give it to the best player of last season, then it was Virgil van Dijk. I don’t know exactly how it will work but that is how I see it. “The best player of all? That’s Lionel. Best player of last season? That’s Virgil. We will see,” Van Dijk said according to Goal.
