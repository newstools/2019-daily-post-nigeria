Manchester United forward, Jesse Lingard, has revealed the advice former Brazil star Ronaldinho, gave to him. According to the UK Mirror, Ronaldinho told Lingard to always play football with a smile on his face. “When I watched videos of Ronaldinho, he’s always smiling no matter what. “It’s the love of the game. “I remember meeting him in America a few years ago, he said to me: ‘No matter what, always enjoy football, always play with a smile on your face.’ “After that, I constantly do that. It’s mad watching videos of him, then actually meeting him and it felt mad for him to actually have that advice for me. You take that on board from one of the all-time greats. “As soon as I kicked a ball I was happy, I’ve always enjoyed football growing up and wanted to take that into the first team. You can’t stop smiling on the pitch, stop being happy. “Everyone who dreamed of being a footballer and is a footballer, our dreams are made and we’re in a nice position so all I can do is smile. Of course you want to win the game but that enjoyment side is important,” Lingard said.
