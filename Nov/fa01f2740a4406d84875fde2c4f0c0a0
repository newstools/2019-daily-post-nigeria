Manchester City midfielder, Ilkay Gundogan, has identified Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi as ‘the greatest footballer of all time’ ahead of Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo. Gundogan, who is currently away on international duty with Germany national team, following his side’s Premier League 3-1 defeat to Liverpool on Sunday, believes Messi is the star player of this generation ahead of Ronaldo. Asked to choose between Ronaldo and Messi, Gundogan was quoted by Goal said: “Lionel Messi [is the best player in the world]. “In my opinion, he has very special abilities. He has talents and he always manages to show it on the pitch. He always has the instinct to make the right decision. “He uses his speed well against the opponents he plays. He has a strong finish. All in all, no one else has as much quality as Lionel Messi. “He is the star player of my generation and the greatest footballer of all-time. I hope we get to watch him play for a few more years.” Messi is among the 30-man shortlist for this year’s Ballon d’ Or alongside Ronaldo.
