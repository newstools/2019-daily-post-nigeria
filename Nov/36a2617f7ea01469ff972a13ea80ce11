A Chief Magistrate Court in Ilorin on Tuesday ordered that two fake herbalists are remanded in Police custody allegedly defrauding two brothers of N5 million. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the Chief Magistrate, Mrs Kudirat Yahaya ordered that Augustine Joko and Raheem Alaba, be remanded, following an application by the prosecutor, Insp. Mathew Olorunshaye. Olorunshaye prayed the court to remand the defendant pending police investigation. Yahaya adjourned the case until Nov. 26, for further mention. The police charged Yahaya and Joko with two counts of conspiracy and false pretence. Earlier, Olorunshaye, told the court that the case was reported on Nov. 3, through a petition by James and Donald Christopher, both of Budo-Doka, Gweri of Kaiama, to the Commissioner of Police. Olorunshaye said that between the months of April and October 2019, the defendants and four others now at large conspired and presented themselves as herbalists, who specialise in ”doubling money”. He alleged that the defendants and their gang fraudulently deceived the brothers to give them N5 million with a promise to double the amount to N50 million. The prosecutor said that the defendants were arrested during a sting operation, while trying to collect more money from the complainants in Maraba Area, Ilorin. He alleged that other suspects took to their heels. The offence, he said, contravened the provisions of Section 97 of the Penal Code and Section 1(3) of Advance Fee Fraud and other Related Offences Act 2006. The defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
