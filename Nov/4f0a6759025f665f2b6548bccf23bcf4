Arsenal will replace their manager, Unai Emery with former midfielder, Mikel Arteta or ex-Juventus coach, Massimiliano Allegri if the former Paris Saint-Germain boss fails to lead the Gunners to victory in their next three matches against Eintracht, Norwich City and Brighton. According to The Times, Arsenal chiefs are interested in talking to Arteta and Allegri about replacing Emery at Emirates following the club’s disappointing 2-2 draw at home against Southampton in the Premier League over the weekend. Emery has overseen a miserable start to the 2019/2020 Premier League season since he replaced Arsene Wenger last year. Emery’s men are already eight points off UEFA Champions League spots. Arteta, who was strongly linked with the job in north London before Emery’s appointment, has enjoyed much success as assistant to Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, while Allegri won five Serie A titles and four Coppa Italias during his spell at Juventus, before leaving the Italian giants earlier in the year.
