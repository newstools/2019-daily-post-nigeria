The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Wednesday, arraigned a bank staff, Anieka Udoh for allegedly stealing $8,907 belonging to Majo-General Umaru Mohammed. Udoh was made to appear before Justice Sherifat Solebo of the Special Offences Court sitting in Ikeja. DAILY POST recalls that Udoh is also standing trial in a similar case before Justice Saliu Seidu of the Federal High Court, Ikoyi. EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren said this in a statement in Abuja. The charge reads: “That you Anieka Udoh sometime in 2006 whilst being a staff of Ecobank Plc in Lagos within the Ikeja Judicial Division with intent to defraud, stole and fraudulently converted the sum of USD8, 907 (Eight Thousand, Nine Hundred and Seven United States Dollars) property of Major General Umaru Mohammad.” The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge when read to him. Upon the defendant’s plea, prosecution counsel, Kufre Uduak asked the court for a trial date and to remand the defendant in a Correctional Centre, pending the determination of the case. But the defence counsel, O.J. Owoh told the court that a bail application had been filed and served on the prosecution on behalf of his client. He, therefore, urged the court to admit the defendant to bail on liberal terms. In his ruling, Justice Solebo granted the defendant bail in the sum of N2million and two sureties in like sum. One of the sureties, he said must be resident in Lagos, with proof of residence. He also adjourned the case to November 28, for commencement of trial and remanded the defendant in the Nigerian Correctional Service custody pending the perfection of his bail conditions.
