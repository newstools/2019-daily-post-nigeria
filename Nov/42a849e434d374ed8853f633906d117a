Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, is backing Manchester City to defeat Liverpool on Sunday. The Reds, who are currently six points clear at the top, host City at Anfield. Pundits have tipped Liverpool to win the game and go on to win the Premier League. But Berbatov, speaking with BetFair, disagreed and believed Pep Guardiola’s men would take all three points, even without first-choice goalkeeper, Ederson. “Whoever plays in goal for Manchester City won’t be too much of a concern for Pep Guardiola, as he has faith in Ederson’s understudy Claudio Bravo. “The City manager will be aiming to come away from Anfield with three points on Sunday. “It will be tight, and the first half could be a tactical chess match, but I’m backing City to nick this one and blow the title race wide open,” Berbatov said.
