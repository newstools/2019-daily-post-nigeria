Arsenal striker, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, was pictured alongside his crashed Lamborghini, the UK Sun reports. It is believed that incident happened, before his first game as the new Gunners captain against Leicester City, which ended in a 2-0 defeat. Aubameyang appeared to be in despair, as he stood next to the crumpled bonnet of his £270,000 silver Lamborghini, following a prang on the M25. The sportscar had been involved in a crash with a Mercedes near Potters Bar in Hertfordshire. It is believed nobody was hurt in the incident.
