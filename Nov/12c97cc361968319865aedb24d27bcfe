Former presidential candidate of the Young Progressives Party, YPP, Kingsley Moghalu has lamented the conduct of November 16 elections in Bayelsa and Kogi States. The former presidential candidate declared that what transpired during Kogi and Bayelsa States respectively shows that Nigeria has no democracy. The election in both states were marred by violence, ballot box snatching and others. DAILY POST reports that the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, declared thirty of its ad hoc staff who participated in yesterday’s governorship election in Olamaboro Local Government Area (LGA), Kogi state, missing. The electoral body disclosed this early Sunday morning through the Local Government Area’s Electoral Officer in charge of collating and announcing results, Garba Mahmood. Mahmood said that the INEC ad-hoc workers were reported missing after some police officers raised concern that they were last seen shortly after voting ended at 2 p.m. Also, Senator Dino Melaye announced the death of his nephew, Olorunjuwon, who was shot by unknown gunmen at his polling unit during the Saturday’s election. Reacting, Moghalu in a post on his Twitter account, advocated for a solution to electoral problems. He listed electronic voting and an overhaul of the Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC) as a solution to the current electoral problems. Moghalu wrote: “With the conduct of “elections” in Kogi and Bayelsa states last weekend it’s clear we don’t have a democracy really. “We should stop deceiving ourselves. We need fundamental electoral reform in Nigeria; digital/electronic voting,overhaul of INEC. Until that happens.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
