The Federal University of Technology Akure, FUTA has expelled six of its students who were caught on camera assaulting a 100-level student.

DAILY POST had last week reported a viral video where some students stormed a girls room in an off-campus hostel and attacked a fellow student  over an alleged altercation with a school daughter of one of the bullies. The expulsion was contained in a statement issued by the Institution’s Deputy Director, Corporate Communications, Adegbenro Adebanjo The expelled students are 1.

Alao Olabimpe Cecilia CSP/ (100 L) According to the Mr Adebanjo, “the expulsion is in line with the position of Page 48 of the 2019/2020 Students Handbook which prescribes expulsion from the University for Students who engage in physical assault or battery on another student outside the university premises. “As a consequence of their expulsion, their studentship of FUTA ceases forthwith with all its rights and privileges. He added that “the punishment meted out to the affected students is not to pander to the justifiable public outcry that greeted their odious act but in tandem with the rules and regulations as contained in the Students code of conduct as stipulated in the University Handbook and oath of matriculation which all students are made to sign and subscribe to.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
