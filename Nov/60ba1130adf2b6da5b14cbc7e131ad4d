Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has commiserated with the family and professional colleagues of former Information Minister, Chief Alex Akinyele. Akinyele, who was Minister during the era of former Head of State, Ibrahim Babangida died on Thursday at 81 after an illness. Reacting to the death, the former governor of Lagos State, described the late Akinyele as an elder statesman who contributed immensely to Nigeria’s development. A condolence message signed by his Media Aide, Tunde Rahman and sent to DAILY POST, said the late minister would be deeply missed by the country he served to the best of his abilities. He said: “Chief Alex Akinyele was an elder statesman. He served the country to the best of his abilities. He did his best as Minister of Information and later Chairman of the Nigerian Sports Commission. “He was also one leader who was very proud of his Yoruba, indeed Ondo heritage, and demonstrated this often in his appearance and conduct. “Chief Akinyele radiated warmth and tenderness. To meet him is to like him. He was full of life. He was unmistakable with his sartorial elegance. The country he did his best for will sorely miss him. “My thoughts are with his family, friends, and relations at this moment. May they find the strength to live through his passing. I mourn with his professional colleagues, the Public Relations practitioners and members of the Nigeria Institute of Public Relations. “My condolences also go to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu and the government and people of Ondo State. “May the soul of Chief Akinyele find eternal rest in the bosom of the Lord.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
