The new Commissioner of Police in Ogun State, Kenneth Ebrimson, on Wednesday told Gov Dapo Abiodun that he was in the state as a crime fighter. The new CP, who described himself as someone on the field, said he would work tirelessly to reduce, to the barest minimum, crimes and criminalities in Ogun. Ebrimson said this while he met Gov Abiodun, in company with the outgoing CP, Bashir Makama, at the Okemosan Governor’s office, Abeokuta. While promising to fight crime in all the nooks and crannies of Ogun, Ebrimson promised to guarantee the safety of lives and property of the people, no matter who is involved. Abiodun, while welcoming Ebrimson, warned criminals to stay clear of the state, saying his administration has zero tolerance for crimes and criminal activities “As a Gateway State, bordering some States and a neighbouring country, this comes with advantages and disadvantages. It means that criminals also go through our State. We will continue to be innovative and very intolerant to crimes and criminalities in this State. “There will be no room for any criminal in this State. We will not tolerate it. We intend to keep the peace we are enjoying and that is why we are putting in place measures to ensure that the overflow from Lagos translates into a society where people can come and live, work and play without any fear of being attacked, robbed, kidnapped or live with any foreboding fear of criminal behaviour,” he stated. The Governor commended the outgoing Police Commissioner, Mr. Bashir Makama for doing a good job while in the State, attributing the peace in Ogun to the co-operation between government and the police force in achieving a crime-free society. DAILY POST reported Sunday that Ebrimson was redeployed to Ogun State in place of Edgal Imohimi, who was earlier posted to take over from Makama as the state’s Police Commissioner.
