Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters (Senate), Babajide Omoworare, said President Muhammadu Buhari did not undermine the office of Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo by not allowing him to act in his stead. The aide was reacting to public criticisms when the President signed the amended deep offshore and Inland Basin Oil Production Sharing Contract at the Nigerian House in London while on a private visit. At a press conference on Wednesday, Omoworare said, Nigeria’s House in London carries the same jurisdiction for Mr. President to work as if he was actually in the Aso Villa. Many have argued that since the reason for Buhari visit to the UK is not known, he should have handed over to Osinbajo to act in his place who could sign the bill as well. Critics have also said taking documents to the President to attend to in the UK is a waste of taxpayers money. “Contrary to the claims by some individuals and groups, the president has not in any way undermined or relegated the office of the Vice-president. “He has no reason to do so. I don’t think there is any way or manner that the office of the Vice-President has been relegated. “The only celebrated case was that of the late President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua, who was ill and could not transmit any letter to the National a
Assembly. “National Assembly had to work around the situation by ensuring that the executive powers go to the vice-president.” Meanwhile, there were reports that President Buhari had approved the sacking of 35 aides attached to Vice President, Osinbajo’s office.
