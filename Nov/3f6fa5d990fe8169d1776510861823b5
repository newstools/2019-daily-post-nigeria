Two Premier League legends, Alan Shearer and Tim Sherwood, have said that referee Christopher Kavanagh was right not to award a penalty to Arsenal after Nigeria international, Wilfred Ndidi handled the ball in the area during the first half of the game against Leicester City. Leicester City went ahead to win the game 2-0 with goals from Jamie Vardy and James Maddison. Ndidi missed his clearance and his trailing hand prevented Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from scoring. Speaking on Premier League Matchday Live, former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder, Sherwood said, ”Not for me, I am not sure what Ndidi can do there, he’s done well to get back in but I am not sure where he can put his arm, it definitely hits his arm there but that’s a great chance.” Shearer on his part said, ”He’s actually falling down there, isn’t it, so there is nothing else he can do with his arm other than to what you do when you fall down, you got to put your arm down there to protect it to stop that fall but that is a wonderful chance.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
