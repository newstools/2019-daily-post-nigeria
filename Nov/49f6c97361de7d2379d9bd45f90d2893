Nigeria skipper, Ahmed Musa, has admitted his fear of playing on a synthetic pitch, when they face Lesotho in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on Sunday. The Super Eagles are top of Group L with three points, after beating Benin Republic 2-1 on Wednesday. Musa was a late minute substitute in the game and is looking ahead to the next fixture, but is worried for his team mates. “As you can see, it was a tough game for the team today but at the end of 90 minutes, we have three points so we are going over there to have another win because we know that the game is going to be very tough. “We are going to play on an artificial pitch, it is not that easy because some of the players are not used to playing on a synthetic pitch. “But we know what everybody expects from us so we are going there to do our best to win,” the Al Nassr winger told reporters in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom state capital.
