Barcelona and Real Madrid were kept apart in Monday’s draw for the Spanish Super Cup, but are on course to meet in the final. Madrid will play Valencia in the first semi-final on January 8, with Barca facing Atletico Madrid in the other one a day later. The final will be played January 12. All three fixtures will be played at the 62,000-capacity King Abdullah Sports City stadium in Saudi Arabia. The Spanish Football Federation [RFEF] president, Luis Rubiales, speaking at the draw, said: “We hope that our opinion will be respected, which is to back the people that are in Saudi Arabia and to collaborate with the country’s federation to serve as tool for social change. “It’s going to benefit men and women that live there. There are others with different opinions, some created from nothing, but we will also respect that.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
