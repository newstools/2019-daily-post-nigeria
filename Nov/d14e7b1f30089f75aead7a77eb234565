Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has apologised to the club’s fans following his team’s disappointing 1-1 draw in the Champions League against Napoli on Wednesday. Liverpool were held to a 1-1 draw at Anfield on Wednesday night, with Dejan Lovren equalising in the second half after Dries Mertens had put the visitors ahead thanks to a fine finish. The result has left the Champions League holders needing victory in their last group game at RB Salzburg on December 10 to top the group. Klopp has said sorry to Liverpool supporters that were hoping for a pre-Christmas holiday in Austria. “It is still open, the group is still open,’ the Reds manager BT Sport. “It’s ok, not ideal, but ok. “I don’t want to say we need intensity in every game, but now we have it already – can you tell me in all my time here when it was easy. “Last year we had to win 1-0 against Napoli in the final game, and I can not remember a bigger pressure than that. “I know how human beings are and I am sure they were hoping we could win here so we could make a holiday game in Salzburg or something like that. “But it didn’t happen, I am sorry – really it never happens. There is always something on it.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
