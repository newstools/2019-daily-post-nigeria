Arsenal striker, Alexandre Lacazette, has admitted that he and his team-mates are low on confidence. The Gunners have only won once in their last six Premier League matches. The run sees them in sixth place, eight points off Champions League spots and puts manager Unai Emery under pressure. However, Lacazette, speaking to the UK Mirror, insists Emery is not to blame for the poor form. “Last season when we were unbeaten in 20 games in a row, nobody said anything about the coach or manager. “We miss confidence and we need the international break. “I hope we are going to come back well. We want to be top four, of course. “Now we are nine points behind Chelsea and Leicester and it is going to be hard, but everything is possible in football,” Lacazette said.
