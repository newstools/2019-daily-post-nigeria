Former Chelsea star, Joe Cole, has insisted that Manchester City’s 2-2 draw against Newcastle United on Saturday has handed Liverpool this season’s English Premier League, EPL, title. Cole believes that the points gap between Liverpool and Man City on the EPL table will be too much for Pep Guardiola’s men to get back. Jetro Willems cancelled out Raheem Sterling’s opener in the first-half of the encounter. However, two late goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Jonjo Shelvey ensure both teams played a draw at St. James’ Park. “For Man City it is a different story. I think they have handed Liverpool the title here today,” the former Liverpool midfielder told BT Sport. “I think it is too much. Liverpool will probably win today and 11 points will be too much for them to get back.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
