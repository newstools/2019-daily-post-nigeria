Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, scored once and set up two goals, as they beat Borussia Dortmund 3-1, to qualify for the Champions League round of 16 on Wednesday. In doing so, Messi surpassed Cristiano Ronaldo’s record, by scoring against his 34th opponent in the competition. Messi previously shared the record with Raul and Ronaldo, who have each netted against 33 different opponents in the Champions League. The Argentine superstar failed to hit the net in Barca’s first game against Dortmund in September, having come off the bench as a second-half substitute in a game that ended 0-0. But he made up for that at the Camp Nou in his 700th appearance for the club. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
