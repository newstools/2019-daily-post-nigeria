Chelsea midfielder, Mateo Kovacic, has said Frank Lampard is the “perfect teacher” for the young players at the club. Lampard replaced Maurizio Sarri at Stamford Bridge in the summer and has already made a big impact. The Blues are currently third in the Premier League, following a shaky start to the campaign. Kovacic has hailed Lampard as a “great guy”, who enjoys laughing and joking with the Chelsea squad and insists his team-mates are enjoying playing under the legendary midfielder. “It’s been nice, nice of course. Now I see why he was such a great player. “His mentality is really strong. That’s what he wants to bring to us: to have a strong mentality, a winning mentality. He always won a lot of trophies. “He has a great connection with every player. He is a great guy, he likes to joke, he likes to laugh. He’s the perfect teacher for us. “We need to learn from him, and for now we are enjoying it, he is as well enjoying it, so it’s a nice connection. “Now the moment is good, when the tough moments come it will be a test for us and for him, but we need to keep training as we are doing. “We are working really hard. Four months he has been here, and every training was hard, and that’s important being at such a great club like Chelsea,” Kovacic told the official website.
