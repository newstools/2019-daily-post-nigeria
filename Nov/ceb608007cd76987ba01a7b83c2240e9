England manager, Gareth Southgate, will not select Raheem Sterling, for Thursday’s Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro, following an incident at their St George’s Park training base. The FA, in a statement, said Sterling has been dropped because of a “disturbance in a private team area at St. George’s Park” that occurred on Monday. The incident is reported to have involved Joe Gomez, with both players having clashed during Liverpool’s 3-1 win over Manchester City on Sunday. However, Sterling is set to remain with the squad and could play in England’s upcoming match against Kosovo. “We have taken the decision to not consider Raheem for the match against Montenegro on Thursday. “One of the great challenges and strengths for us is that we’ve been able to separate club rivalries from the national team. Unfortunately, the emotions of yesterday’s game were still raw. “My feeling is that the right thing for the team is the action we have taken. Now that the decision has been made with the agreement of the entire squad, it’s important that we support the players and focus on Thursday night,” manager Gareth Southgate said: Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
