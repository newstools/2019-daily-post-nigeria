Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa state has addressed reports of a rift with former President Goodluck Jonathan. Dickson blamed ‘political jobbers’ for making misleading comments and misrepresenting his actions with Jonathan over the choice of the PDP governorship candidate. Dickson said those who claimed to be working for Jonathan did not mean well for the former President. He said that Jonathan remained his leader, adding that he served as a political strategist to the ex-president. He, however, added that those sowing seeds of discord between them were unfair to him. “I do not want to say much but those of them sowing seed of discord were not there when I fought battles for the former President,’’ he stated. Dickson noted that he stood with Jonathan and never compromised during his re-election bid in 2015 as some did, NAN reports. “I told him then that the election was our own and those who wanted to impose a successor on me are unfair. “I will reveal more in my memoirs when I leave office and people will have the details,” Dickson said.
