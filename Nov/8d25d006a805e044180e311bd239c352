The Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Tanko Muhammad, has cautioned judges of superior courts in Nigeria to desist from using technicalities to hinder justice delivery. NAN reports that Muhammad gave the advice on Monday in Abuja in an address at the opening of the 2019 All Nigeria Judges’ Conference of Superior Courts holding at the National Judicial Institute. He said that there was a need for judges to redouble their standards in the process of discharging adjudicatory functions in order to sustain public confidence. “In order to sustain public confidence in the judiciary, judges must continue to be proactive by not allowing technicalities to stand in the way of substantive justice.’’ He noted that relying on technicalities in justice dispensation contributed in the delay of justice delivery. “Technicalities in itself sometimes constitute unreasonable delay in dispensing with cases. “Timely disposition of cases in our courts will in no small measure shore up public confidence in the judiciary,’’ Muhammad said. He added that delay in justice delivery and the volume of cases on the dockets of courts still left much to be desired. The CJN, however, said that urgent reforms were being put in place to take care of the challenges.
