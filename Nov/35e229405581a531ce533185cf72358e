Elder statesman, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu. has told President Muhammadu Buhari that Igbos do not hate him as perceived by some sections of the country. The billionaire politician added that the Igbos only want to be treated as integral part of the country. Iwuanyanwu stated this at the weekend during a courtesy visit by the Emir of Bichi, Kano State, Aminu Ado Bayero to his house in Owerri, the Imo State capital. He said that Ndigbo does not hate the president and also have nothing against him. He said, “He is not corrupt. Nobody should tell me that Buhari is not fighting corruption. He introduced War Against Indiscipline in this country. His lifestyle is simple. But he thinks Ndigbo hate him. We don’t hate him. “Ndigbo believe in what Buhari believes in — that corruption should be stopped. That’s why you can hardly see any Igbo man in the list of corrupt Nigerians or those being prosecuted by the EFCC for corruption. “Though, we may have some cases of 419. But, look at the case where our country was defrauded to the tune of $9.6billion. You can’t find any Igbo man there because we believe in what Buhari believes. “But some people give wrong impression that Ndigbo hate Buhari. That’s not true. “The only thing Ndigbo want is to be given our due in the country. Anything that is due to us, give it to us. When these things are not done and our people agitate for them, it looks as if Igbo hate Buhari.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
