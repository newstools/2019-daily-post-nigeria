Gov. Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa has appealed to the people of Bayelsa to keep their faith with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as they go to the polls on Nov. 16 to elect his successor. He said the faithful of the party who supported former President Goodluck Jonathan to become President would be disappointed if the people of Bayelsa dumped PDP for the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC). He advised the people to make informed choices between Sen. Douye Diri of the PDP and Chief David Lyon of the APC after listening to the candidates sell their plans as they canvassed for votes in a peaceful atmosphere. Dickson made the call in a radio broadcast, on Sunday night, monitored by News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Yenagoa, adding that voting against the PDP would amount to betrayal of trust to PDP faithful nationwide. “I advise Bayelsa people in their own interest to keep faith with PDP; the followers of PDP across the country who made sacrifices and supported one of our own to become President will feel disappointed if we abandon PDP. “It is on record that some of them were attacked for supporting former President Goodluck Jonathan and so it is only reasonable that we remain with PDP,” Dickson said.
