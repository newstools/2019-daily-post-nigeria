The Department of State Services, DSS, Friday, declared that it has confirmed receipt of the court order for the release of Omoyele Sowore. It also affirmed that nobody has come to take him on bail. DSS Public Relations officer, Peter Afunanya said this in a statement in Abuja. He said, “It is important that the public notes that since the receipt of the order, no person has turned up at the DSS to take delivery of him. This becomes imperative for reasons of accountability. “However, the Court has been properly briefed on this development and the steps being taken to ensure compliance with its order. “The Service, under the leadership of Yusuf Magaji Bichi (fwc), as the Director General, is not a lawless organization and will never obstruct justice or disobey Court orders. It, therefore, affirms that it will do all that is needful once the appropriate processes have been concluded”.
