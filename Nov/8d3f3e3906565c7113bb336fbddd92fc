A Court of Appeal sitting in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital on Monday set aside the tribunal judgement that nullified the petition brought to the court by the Governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Mr. Adebayo Adelabu in the March 9th election in Oyo state against Governor Seyi Makinde of the State. DAILY POST recalls that the tribunal had in September dismissed the petition of Adelabu challenging the election of Seyi Makinde as the Governor of Oyo State. However, the Appeal Court on Monday found out that the judgement of the tribunal dismissing Adelabu’s petition was perversed, therefore set the judgement aside. The Court of Appeal did not make any further order concerning the election of Makinde. The Court did not make any order for re- hearing of the election petition due to the number of days that have been spent in the case. The Court added that status quo as the time of filing the petition by Adelabu remains. The Court of Appeal in its lead judgement ruled that the appellants, APC and Adelabu were not given fair hearing by the tribunal and thereby set aside the tribunal judgement. Bearing in mind that electoral act only gives a grace of 180 days for the case to be heard at the tribunal, the Appeal Court affirmed that the tribunal has duly spent her time and so nothing could be done on their pronouncement as to the validity of the election. The Appeal Court resolved all issues in the favour of the appellants. Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
