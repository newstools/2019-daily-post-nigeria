Super Eagles head coach, Gernot Rohr has said that he preferred to concede first and win the match following his side’s 4-2 victory over Lesotho in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, qualifier encounter on Sunday in Maseru. DAILY POST recalls that the hosts took the lead in the 11th minute through Masoabi Nkoto.  However, the Super Eagles fought back through Alex Iwobi and Samuel Chukwueze, to take a 2-1 lead into the break. Victor Osimhen, who set up the first two goals, then helped himself to a second-half brace. Collins Awaziem’s own goal did not do much damage, as Gernot Rohr’s men sealed a second successive win in Group L. “Some matches, you score the first goal and in some matches you concede first,” Rohr told reporters in his post-match press conference after the game. “We scored first against Brazil and Ukraine but we didn’t win, so I prefer to concede first and win the match. “This has proven that my players have a good spirit because they never give up. “They continue to play well and do not panic. We have a very young team and what I like is the enthusiasm to play football.” Rohr added: “We know that it’s difficult to win in Lesotho especially when you concede the first goal. They played very well in the beginning but we had to take the game in our hands. “We had a long travel by night and you can see that at the beginning, my players were not fully concentrated. “In the second half, we changed our organisation a little bit and it was better and better. I feel that my players have fun when they play football and that is most important. “We won but congrats to my colleague, he has a good team they gave us a lot of trouble.” Rohr’s men will now host Sierra Leone in their next match on August 31, 2020.
