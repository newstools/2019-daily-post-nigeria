The man suspected of have stabbed two people to death in London on Friday before being shot dead by police has been identified by authorities as a 28-year-old Usman Khan, who had previously been convicted for terror offences. DAILY POST had reported that a man and a woman died during the attack on London Bridge. According to BBC, a man and two women, were also injured and have remained in hospital. Neil Basu, head of British counterterrorism policing, in a statement said, “This individual was known to authorities, having been convicted in 2012 for terrorism offences. “He was released from prison in December 2018 on licence and clearly, a key line of enquiry now is to establish how he came to carry out this attack,” he said, adding that officers were carrying out searches at an address in Staffordshire, the area where the suspect had been residing. Basu further stated that police were not actively seeking anyone else in relation to the attack.
Extensive cordons were, “likely to remain in place for some time,” Basu added, asking the public to continue to avoid the area. London Mayor Sadiq Khan tweeted that during the weekend there would be “enhanced police patrols, including firearms teams, on the streets of London”. The suspect, who was shot dead by specialist armed officers, was wearing a, “hoax explosive device,” Basu had said earlier. He said police were called just before 2 pm (1400 GMT), “to a stabbing scene at a premises near London Bridge.” “A male suspect was shot by specialist armed officers from City of London Police and I can confirm that this suspect died at the scene,” he said.
