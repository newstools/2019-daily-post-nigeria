Magnus Abe, immediate past Senator from Rivers South East has said the insistence of the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi to “summarily expel” him from the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the state was responsible for the crisis in the party. In a statement he signed and issued on Tuesday titled: “The truth about Rivers APC crisis,” Abe stated that he has been maligned in the party due to his political ambition. He said: “Nigerians are aware that the crisis in the APC in Rivers state had its origin in the unconstitutional decision of the leader of the party in the state, Rt Hon Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi to summarily expel me, and other leaders of the party in the state seen as sympathetic to my governorship ambition for no discernible reason. “He announced this publicly at the meeting of party stakeholders held at the Dome. “He stated at that meeting that Senator Abe and all those sympathetic to him must leave the party and went further to state that he was ready to destroy the party in Rivers State to Achieve that objective. “Despite the pleas of several leaders present at that meeting, in fact, Mr Loolo Ibieneye told him that the path he has chosen was not only unconstitutional but will lead the party to disaster. “Incidentally this was the last day that Rivers APC sat together in unity with Amaechi present. “The directive to unilaterally exclude party members from all party activities without due process is the origin and the root of the crisis in the party.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
