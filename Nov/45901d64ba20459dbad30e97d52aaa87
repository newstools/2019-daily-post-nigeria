Former Liverpool striker, Michael Owen, has predicted a loss for Newcastle United when they face Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday. Newcastle host the league champions in this weekend’s early kick-off, and despite registering a win in the corresponding fixture last season, the ex-Magpie is not holding out high hopes for his former club. Speaking to Bet Victor, he said: “I was disappointed with Newcastle at Villa Park on Monday and their attacking players continue to struggle to create opportunities let alone score goals at present. “Steve Bruce’s side will have to be at the top of their game when champions Manchester City come to town in Saturday’s early kick-off. “Yes, the Magpies came from behind to win the corresponding fixture 2-1 at St James’ Park last season, but I don’t expect Pep Guardiola’s side to slip up at the weekend given they have the opportunity to cut the deficit – albeit briefly – to leaders Liverpool to six points with a win.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
