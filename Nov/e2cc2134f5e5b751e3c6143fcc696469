Liverpool ace, Mohamed Salah has insisted that his side will still have a long way to go in winning this season’s English Premier League title even if they beat Manchester City on Sunday at Anfield. Unbeaten Liverpool play host to Pep Guardiola’s men, who have won five of their last six matches in all competitions. Jurgen Klopp’s side are unbeaten in the league this season and go into the match six points clear of rivals City after 11 games played. But Salah now believes that victory over the Citizens this weekend will not prove decisive at this stage of the season, adding that it is too early. “They [Man City] were talking about that [victory over Liverpool will prove decisive] in December last year when we were six or seven points ahead,” Salah told Sky Sports. “It is not over. It is for three points. If you go through a period of time and lose three games, you are in trouble. “Even if we win against Man City, it is a long way. We are in November, it is too early to talk about the Premier League [title].” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
