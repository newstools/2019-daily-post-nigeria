Manchester United striker, Marcus Rashford, has said it is “not impossible” for the club to finish in the top four this season. The Red Devils are currently in 10th place with 13 points, 10 behind Leicester City and Chelsea who are currently third and fourth. But Rashford believes that making the Champions League places is not out of United’s reach. “It’s going to be tough [to get into the top four] but it’s nowhere near impossible. We don’t need to focus on any other teams, we play our best football when we focus on ourselves and us improving. “That’s the only way Man Utd play good football and we need to get back to doing that. It can be very simple for us and at the same time, you don’t want to make it complicated for yourself. “The main thing is bouncing back. I always think with home games, if you’re energetic on the pitch, you’re making runs and you’re lively, you win games more often than not. “Old Trafford is a special place and if we do that with the fans behind us, it’s a tough place to come. With the tempo we play at when we’re at our best, it’s very hard to stop us so we use it as a template and we need to get back to doing that. “I just look at the games where we’ve done it well and the games where we haven’t. You weigh them up and look at how you can be more consistent in the games you’ve done well in. “There was the game against Leicester where it wasn’t 90 minutes of fun but you go through the game. We won 1-0 and it does a lot for the team and you as an individual. But ideally, you want that support there and you want to be in positions to help your team-mates,” he told Soccer Saturday.
