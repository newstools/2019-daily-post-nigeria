Arsenal have publicly backed under-fire manager, Unai Emery, the UK Mirror reports. This happened on Monday, when the club’s head of football Raul Sanllehi and managing director, Vinai Venkatesham, met staff at a pre-planned get together for 200 staff. They admitted that they do “need to improve” but still “firmly believe” Emery is the right man for the job. The Gunners currently sit in sixth place and are eight points off Champions League places. However, the Arsenal hierarchy told staff: “We are as disappointed as everyone else with both our results and performances at this stage of the season. We share the frustration with our fans, Unai, players and all our staff as they are not at the level we want or expect. “Things need to improve to meet our objectives for the season, and we firmly believe Unai is the right man for the job, together with the backroom team we have in place. We are all working intensively behind the scenes to turn things around and are confident we will. “We never take our fantastic support for granted. We hope we can all stick together and get behind the team in this challenging period, as together we are stronger.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
