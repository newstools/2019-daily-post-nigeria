The Zamfara State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has commended the PDP-led leadership in the state for canceling bogus allowances to past political leaders of the state. The party spoke through Alhaji Sani Gwamna, its Vice Chairman in the Central Senatorial District. Gwamna, told newsmen shortly after the party’s meeting on Saturday in Gusau, that monies saved from repealing the pension law should be channelled into development projects. Gov Matawalle had, on Wednesday, passed into law a bill cancelling bogus pensions for former Deputy Governors, their deputies, Speakers, and other officials of the state legislature. Gwamna, while describing the step as “commendable”, said that the money saved from the repealed pensions law should be channeled into opening up the rural areas to improve the lives of the people. On current happenings in the state, Gwamna alleged that security personnel were “being used by politicians in power to achieve selfish interests”. “We have remained law abiding, but our members are being subjected to intimidation, harassment and threats by law enforcement agents. This is becoming a cause for concern. “We know there are offices of security agencies; as law abiding citizens, we are ready to go to these offices when invited on any issue, but when security men arrest our members without due process, that will not be fair.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
