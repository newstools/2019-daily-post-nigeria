Femi Fani-Kayode, former minister of aviation has commended the court ruling in favour of Commonwealth of Zion Assembly, COZA, Pastor, Biodun Fatoyinbo. DAILY POST on Thursday reported that a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory dismissed the rape case filed by Busola Dakola, wife of popular singer, Timi Dakolo against Fatoyinbo. The court sitting in Bwari, Abuja dismissed the case against Fatoyinbo on the ground that it amounts to injustice and an abuse of judicial process. According to the ruling, the case is empty and purely sentimental. The presiding judge, Justice Oathman A. Musa, said the case was aimed more at cruelty than obtaining justice. Justice Musa also awarded the cost of N1,000,000 against Busola Dakolo and held that the fine would have been 10 times more because the court’s time was wasted. Reacting to the ruling, Fani-Kayode said Fatoyinbo has been vindicated by the court ruling. He described the ruling as a shame to those that accused and mocked Fatoyinbo. On his Twitter page, he wrote: ”Now that Biodun Fatoyinbo of COZA has been vindicated I say shame on the accuser of the bretheren and all those who mocked and crucified him wirhout seeing ANY hard and credible evidence. “Those that make false allegations do great damage to the cause of decency and justice.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
