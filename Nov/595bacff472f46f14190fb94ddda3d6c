Tottenham Hotspur forward, Heung-Min Son, has had his red card against Everton overturned. Son was sent off for his tackle on Andre Gomes during the 1-1 Premier League draw on Sunday, which led to the Portugal midfielder suffering a fracture dislocation to his right ankle. Referee Martin Atkinson initially brandished a yellow card, but it was later confirmed he showed a straight red card, which enabled the club to appeal the FA’s decision. An Independent Regulatory Commission assessed the case on Tuesday and agreed it was wrongful dismissal. “Heung-min Son will be available for Tottenham Hotspur FC’s next three domestic fixtures after an independent Regulatory Commission upheld a claim of wrongful dismissal. “The forward was sent off for serious foul play during the Premier League fixture against Everton FC on Sunday 3 November 2019,” the FA said in a statement.
