The Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brig.-Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim, has commended the Federal Government over its ongoing closure of the country’s land borders. Ibrahim spoke on the sidelines of his visit to inspect facilities at the General Yakubu Gowon NYSC Orientation Camp, Dutse, on Saturday. He was represented by the Director, Human Resources Management (HRM), NYSC National Headquarters, Abuja, Mr Abdulrazak Salawu. “The closure of our land borders is a welcome development toward our economic development,” NAN quoted him as saying. “It is unfortunate that most of the goods manufactured in foreign countries that are being imported into Nigeria through these outlets are not better than our goods. “If you take advantage of this closure to do something through the Skills Acquisition Entrepreneurship Development (SAED), there is a market for your goods and services. “I, therefore, charge you to rededicate yourselves to learn something that will make you to become self reliant after your one-year mandatory national service because there are no more white-collar jobs,” he said. The DG also urged the corps members to take advantage of the border closure to learn something through SAED that would sustain them after service.
