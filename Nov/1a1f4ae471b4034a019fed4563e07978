Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, wants to sign Lazio midfielder, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic if the Blues’ FIFA-imposed transfer ban is lifted before the January transfer window, according to the Daily Mirror. DAILY POST had reported a few days ago that the Court of Arbitration for Sport, CAS, has announced that Chelsea’s appeal against a transfer ban by the Federation of International Football Association, FIFA, for breaking rules to sign youth players from abroad will be heard on November 20. FIFA imposed the ban on the Premier League giants after they were found to have broken rules regarding the registering of young players. However, Lampard would be able to make new signings in January if Chelsea’s appeal is successful. Lampard wants to bolster his midfield options for the second half of the season with Ross Barkley and Ruben Loftus-Cheek currently injured. Milinkovic-Savic has been impressive for Lazio so far this season. He was previously linked with a move to Manchester United.
