The Chief Medical Director, CMD, Alex Ekweme Federal University Teaching Hospital, AE-FTHA, Dr. Emeka Ogah at the weekend said that high rate of poverty in Ebonyi State has made many men to deny their wives while in hospital in the state. Ogah made this known while addressing political stakeholders of the state during the official launch of a PET Project of the wife of Ebonyi governor, Mrs Rechael Umahi, in Abakaliki. According to him, “The wife of the governor has done well and has provided succour to many women in the state. We that are working in the hospital can testify that before now, a greater number of women will come with obstructed labour, and they will not come with any wrapper, or any cloth for the unborn child. “There are situations where a woman will come with somebody who is and should to be the husband but will deny that the man is her husband. This is because of poverty. This is because the man has threatened her never to say or agree that he is the husband,” he said. Ogah lamented that such attitude and actions has affected the growth of the hospital, hence many of them cannot pay their hospital bills after treatments. He stated further that a greater number of patients stay longer than expected, thereby resulting to congestion of the hospital, adding that such situation would create no space for the new patients. The CMD revealed further that a greater number of patients as a result of poverty had attempted to run away after treatments to avoid paying the bills.
