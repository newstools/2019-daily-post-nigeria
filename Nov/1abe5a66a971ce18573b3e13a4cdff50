Dr Daniel Olukoya, the General Overseer, Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM), has urged Nigerians to increase their prayers for the country. The GO said Nigeria is in a period that requires all positive input from the citizenry. He also implored Christian leaders to be bold and speak up when there was a need for them to do so. Olukoya spoke on Saturday at the sidelines of a one-day crusade at the Miracle City, Gwagwalada, Abuja. He said: “This moment in time in Nigeria, we need what is called divine intervention; we all need to increase our prayer tempo because prayer is awesome and prayers can do a lot of things. “So, Christians ought to increase their tempo for themselves, for the nation and also live a life of righteousness and holiness because the Bible says that righteousness exalts a nation and sin is a reproach to any people. “We must shun corruption and be people that will love God and our neighbours as we love ourselves”.
