Legendary Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger has predicted this weekend’s English Premier League clash between Liverpool and Manchester City. Wenger believes the absence of Man City defender, Aymeric Laporte, who is yet to recover from a knee injury, could give Jurgen Klopp’s side a major advantage in their EPL title clash with Pep Guardiola’s men on Sunday. Speaking to beIN Sports, Wenger said: “Well, we have seen in recent years that they are very tight games. “We know Man City will take the game to Liverpool, and that Liverpool will be very dangerous on the counter-attack. “I personally feel they could not afford to lose Laporte, Manchester City. “If you look at their results, they still play great football but they are a fractionally a bit more vulnerable defensively. “And that could be a big handicap against Liverpool.” Liverpool are currently six points ahead of Man City in the Premier League table ahead of the encounter.
