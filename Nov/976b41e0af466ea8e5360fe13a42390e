President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in the November 16 election in Bayelsa State, David Lyon, on his victory. Lyon won six Local Government Areas out of the eight in the state to defeat the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Senator Douye Diri, who won just two LGAs – Sagbama and Kolokuma/Opokuma. Buhari, in a statement Monday morning, commended APC supporters in particular and Nigerians who exercised their civic rights in a peaceful manner, notwithstanding the pockets of unrest recorded in some locations. Condemning the loss of lives in Bayelsa, particularly prior to the election, Buhari commiserated with the families of the victims. According to the president: “Violence during elections vitiates our commitment to demonstrate to the world and upcoming generation that we are people capable of electing leaders in a peaceful and orderly manner.” He noted that while officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agencies did their best within the ambit of the law to ensure free, fair and credible elections, “it is unfortunate that pockets of unrest, mostly sponsored by desperate politicians, were recorded during the poll”. “The President looks forward to working with the incoming government to improve the lives of the people in Bayelsa State while ensuring the security of lives and property of all citizens. “President Buhari urges Governor-elect Lyon to carry other divergent interests along in the next phase of governance, imploring those not satisfied with the outcome of the poll to seek redress through the constitutionally established channels”, the statement added.
