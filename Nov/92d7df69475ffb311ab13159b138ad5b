Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has reacted to the Zamfara State House of Assembly’s decision to scrap payment of pensions and other allowances to all former governors, deputies, speakers and deputy speakers. It called on former and serving elected officials to stop collecting outrageous benefits and urged federal lawmakers to enact a similar bill that will stop former public office holders from duplicating payments of pension and allowances in any form. The director, Professor Ishaq Akintola, in a statement on Friday called for a total and comprehensive abolition of all arbitrary payments to past political office holders in the country. Noting that Zamfara lawmakers have taken a bold step towards stopping profligacy in governance, MURIC advised lawmakers in other states to emulate Zamfara lawmakers. In particular, we charge members of the National Assembly (NASS) to lead this action. It said: “There are several past governors in Senate who are earning mouth-watering allowances from the red chamber and still earning pension and allowances from their states as former governors. “This is atrocious, selfish and greedy. How can Nigeria come out of its financial mess if our leaders continue to behave like this? “MURIC throws this challenge to all former this and former that. The challenge goes to those who are currently in Senate and the House of Representatives. We want to know those who are ready to identify with the poor masses. “We remind our lawmakers and holders of public offices, past and present, that if the Nigerian system is so loose that they feel so comfortable, the system of heaven is different. Islamic eschatological tenets affirm that all of them will render account one day before the King of Kings and Master of all masters.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
