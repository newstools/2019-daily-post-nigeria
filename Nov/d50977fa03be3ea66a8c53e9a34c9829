Chelsea striker, Tammy Abraham has reacted to England’s 7-0 victory over Montenegro in a Euro 2020 qualifier encounter at Wembley Stadium on Thursday night. Goals from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (1), Harry Kane (3), Marcus Rashford (1), Aleksandar Sofranac (OG) and Tammy Abraham (1) ensure the Three Lions qualified for Euro 2020. Abraham, who netted his first senior England goal against Montenegro, said that he hopes to channel the praise into his game and continue to deliver for both country and club. “I’ve always believed in myself to score goals,” the 22-year-old said as quoted by Chelsea’s official website. “There’s still a lot in my game I need to develop but I can’t complain. It’s going well. ‘It’s just about maintaining it, not just for the rest of the season but for many years, hopefully. I’m just going into every game, believe in myself, block everything out and focus. “There’s going to be a lot of praise, you just have to stay focused, ignore some bits and use some bits to lift my confidence. “That’s what you need as a player to get to the top level. To always believe, even in tough times.” Abraham added: “Hopefully, hopefully, I don’t want to jinx myself but I believe so [England can win a trophy]. “My dream? Probably being at the Euros, winning it, finishing in the top four or even the top two in the Premier League with Chelsea. Just believing! The sky really is the limit.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
