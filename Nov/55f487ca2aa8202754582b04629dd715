The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), has arraigned one Dennis Joke Emuekevwo, over alleged N557,000 criminal breach of trust. Emuekevwo was brought before Justice Mariya M. Ismaila of the Niger State High Court, Suleja. DAILY POST also learnt that Emuekevwo, a team leader and supervisor in Real Aid Development Initiative was arraigned by the Abuja Zonal Office of the Commission. EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren said this through a statement in Abuja. One of the charges reads: “That you Dennis Joke Emuekevwo, sometime in 2018 in Suleja within the judicial division of this honourable court whilst acting in your capacity as a Team leader/supervisor in Real Aid Development Initiative was entrusted to supervise the operations of the said office, you dishonestly converted the aggregate sum of N557,000( Five Hundred and Fifty Seven Thousand Naira) to your own use and thereby committed a criminal breach of trust in respect of the said sum contrary to and punishable under Section 315 of the Penal Code.” But the accused reportedly pleaded not guilty to the charges over which prosecution counsel Aishatu Ibrahim asked for a trial date and urged the court to remand him in a correctional center, pending trial. In his reaction, Defence counsel, E.E Ekpo prayed the court for a short date for the hearing of his bail application. In his ruling, Justice Ismaila adjourned the matter until December 4, for hearing on the bail application and ordered that the defendant be remanded in the custody of the EFCC.
