Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has instructed the Red Devils’ board to sign Salzburg’s Erling Haaland in the January transfer window. According to Norwegian newspaper, Dagbladet, Solskjaer is eager to land Haaland to Old Trafford in order to bolster his attacking options in January following the departure of Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku from the club last summer. Haaland played under Solskjaer during their time at Molde, where he scored 26 goals in 18 matches in all competitions. The 19-year-old has been impressive for Salzburg so far this season. He is currently the highest goal scorer in the 2019/20 UEFA Champions League with seven goals so far.
