Paris Saint-Germain Sporting Director, Leonardo, has hit back at Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, after he spoke about Kylian Mbappe’s “dream” to play for the Spanish giants.

Speaking all the time about dreams and will, I think it is time to stop a bit. “Kylian is very important for us — he is the best young French player, a world champion and one of the best players in the world. This is not the time to knock him and destabilise him. Honestly, it is time for this to stop,” Leonardo told reporters, after PSG’s 1-0 win over Club Brugge.
