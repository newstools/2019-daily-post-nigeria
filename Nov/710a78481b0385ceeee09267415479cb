Having achieved comparably low human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection prevalence at 1.2 per-cent in Adamawa, the state government is now working to achieve zero prevalence of the virus. The Executive Secretary of Adamawa State Agency for HIV/AIDS, Dr Stephen John, who made the disclosure, said that HIV infection had been dropping steadily over the years and has further gone from the previous 2.5% to 1.2% Dr Stephen, in an interview published on Sunday by a state-owned newspaper, The Scope, said the low infection rate had been achieved in collaboration with a number of implementing partners. “With all this, the percentage has dropped by far, from over 2.5% to 1.2%, which is one of the lowest in the Northeast geopolitical zone,” he said. He added that with so much achieved in the drive against HIV/AIDS, “It is now easier to address bigger problems and possibly eliminate HIV in the state.” He said the 1.2% is an average level and the agency would be focusing on key populations or communities that have a higher prevalence. “Some of these communities are commercial female and male sex workers, long-distance drivers and people found in congregate settings like prisons, communities with poor access to healthcare,” he explained. Giving further hint of how the state has achieved its low HIV prevalence, Dr Stephen said pregnant women were being given top priority. “If any one of them is tested positive, she is actively linked to treatment, care and support to prevent stigma, which is very important,” he said, repeating the resolve of the state to considerably pull down the present 1.2% prevalent rate of HIV infection across the state.
