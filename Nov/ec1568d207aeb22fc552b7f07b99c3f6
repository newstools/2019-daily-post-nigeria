Chelsea Manager, Frank Lampard has revealed what he told his players during the half time of their 4-4 draw with Ajax in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday night at Stamford Bridge. Lampard’s side were three goals down in the Champions League tie, before Ajax saw two of their central defenders, Daley Blind and Joel Veltman sent off. It swung the match in Chelsea’s favour, with a second penalty of the match from Jorginho and goals from Cesar Azpilicueta and Reece James bringing the hosts to level at 4-4. Speaking after the match, Lampard was quoted by Express UK as saying: “I can’t explain the game. “I said [to my players] at half time it will be 3-3 or 4-4, we were so in the game. “We looked dangerous and I felt we would build momentum. “I am not happy overall, this is the Champions League and we made too many mistakes. “The biggest pleasure is the spirit the whole stadium showed. I can’t give you much on the red cards, I didn’t really see what they were for. “At half time I would have taken a draw for sure. Let’s take it as what it was. I was expecting somewhere towards 10 minutes of added time, not sure where four came from.”
