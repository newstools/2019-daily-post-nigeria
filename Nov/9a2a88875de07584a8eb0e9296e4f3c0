Barcelona’s Luis Suarez has identified Chelsea striker, Tammy Abraham, as one of the players that can replace him at the LaLiga club. Suarez recently admitted he is aware the Catalan club is looking at long-term options to replace him in the No.9 role. And the 32-year-old feels Abraham could be the man. Abraham has been in stunning form for Frank Lampard’s side in the Premier League, leading to admiring glances from Suarez as he watches on from Spain. “Obviously there are many very good young people who are playing. “I personally have certain strikers that I look at because I like to watch their football, whether young or old. “One is Abraham, the “9” of Chelsea.
