Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has said he is “in love” with Kylian Mbappe, as his team prepare to host Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League on Tuesday. Madrid were beaten 3-0 by PSG in September in their opening Group A fixture, that Mbappe missed through injury. The French forward was heavily linked with a move to the Santiago Bernabeu in the summer, but ended up staying with the Ligue 1 champions. “I’ve known him for a long time” Zidane told a news conference on Monday ahead of the match. “I’ve been in love with him for a long time, but as a person first. “He came here for a trial a long time ago. Tomorrow he comes here as an opponent.” He added: “What’s important to me is what we are going to do. We know the player he is and his importance to his team. We have to be ready.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
