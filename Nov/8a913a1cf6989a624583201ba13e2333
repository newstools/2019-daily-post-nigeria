Ibrahim Magu, the acting Chairman of the EFCC, has warned Nigerian youths against taking the fast route to achieve success. Magu said the desperate quest by Nigerian youths to ‘blow’ – the modern slang which according to him, depicts desperation for quick wealth, has pushed many into committing crimes. Magu said this at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife on Friday, while delivering the keynote address at the 2019 Symposium of the National Association of Philosophy Students (NAPS), OAU branch. The EFCC boss, who was represented by the Zonal Head of the Commission’s Ibadan zonal office, Friday Ebelo, admonished the students to take their studies seriously rather than engage in fraudulent crimes. Lamenting the increasing trend in the involvement of the Nigerian youth in internet-related crimes, Magu challenged them to re-direct their energy into positive activities that will benefit them and the Nigerian nation. He added that with diligence and persistence success was sure for them rather than engage in crime which may in turn cut short their dreams. “At the individual level, every youth must shun all temptation to be corrupt or be corrupted by any means. “They must realise that the only way to success is hard work. The fast way only leads to destruction. GROW, don’t BLOW! “An attempt to sacrifice steady growth on the altar of a ‘blowing success’ is an invitation to self-destruct. “EFCC is doing its best to ensure that the exceptional talents of the Nigerian youths are properly harnessed and put into appropriate use in the nation-building efforts,” he said.
