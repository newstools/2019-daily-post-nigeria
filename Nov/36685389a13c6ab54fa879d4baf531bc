Juventus manager, Maurizio Sarri, has claimed that he regularly substitutes Cristiano Ronaldo, because of ongoing fitness issues. Ronaldo was replaced by Paulo Dybala in the 55th minute during Juve’s Serie A clash with AC Milan and immediately made his way up the tunnel. Reports in Italy also suggested the 34-year-old left the stadium three minutes to the end of the match. Ronaldo was also replaced midweek in the Champions League. “We must thank Ronaldo, because he made a sacrifice to be there at all tonight in a difficult situation. “He did everything possible to play, but I saw he was not well and thought it best to take him off. It’s only natural a player is going to be irritated to leave the pitch, especially when he worked so hard to be there. “Over the last month, he has had this little knee problem, he had a knock in training and it hurt the collateral ligament. When he trains at high intensity or plays, it unbalances him, so he ends up overcompensating and it damages the calf and thigh muscles. “It is affecting his performances and he is not at his best at the moment. All players who are trying to give their best will have at least five minutes of being annoyed when they are substituted, but a coach would in general be much more worried if he didn’t seem upset,” Sarri told Sky Sport Italia post-match.
