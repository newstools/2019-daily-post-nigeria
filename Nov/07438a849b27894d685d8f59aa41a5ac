Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has alleged that the late Sardauna of Sokoto, Sir Ahmadu Bello was the progenitor of hate speech in Nigeria. Kanu claimed that Bello and the people of the Fulani extraction were the first to experiment hate speech against non-Muslims to advance their political domination in Nigeria. A statement by IPOB’s spokesperson, Emma Power quoted Kanu as saying: “Sir Ahmadu Bello the preliterate Fulani Caliphate feudal lord with his primitive xenophobic tendencies was and still remains the undisputed progenitor of hate speech and irredeemable hater of non-Muslim ethnic groups in the disastrous British colonial experiment known as Nigeria. “Fulani were the first to utilise hate speech to advance their domination of the political space in Nigeria, but today they want to stifle debate and criticism. I suggest this fact guide the thinking of Almajiri lawmakers sponsoring this bill. “Some inhabitants of the abominable damnation, especially those from the south- with their warped and misguided sense of patriotism, still accommodate the obnoxious and downright ignorant views of the Janjaweed unity begging desert dwelling cow loving reprobates. Britain must close their African Zoo to help put the animals that inhabit it out of their collective misery and hopelessness. “Here is undisguised and raw hatred from core Arewa North as represented by Sir Ahamdu Bello in this BBC interview. Are these the type of hypocrites you want to share the same country with?
