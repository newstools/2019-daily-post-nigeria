Candidate in the Kogi West Senatorial rerun election for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Senator Dino Melaye, has spoken on alleged plans to boycott Saturdays rerun senatorial election. Melaye had defeated his All Progressives Congress (APC) rival, Smart Adeyemi, in the February election, but the tribunal and appellate court annulled the election and ordered a fresh one. In the fresh election conducted on November 16, Melaye was trailing Adeyemi, before the exercise was declared inconclusive. A supplementary poll was fixed for November 30. There were reports that Melaye was planning to boycott Saturday’s election. Speaking on Channels TV on Sunday, however, Melaye said the reports making the rounds was a misrepresentation by PDP spokesman. He disclosed that he and his party will not shy away from the rerun election o Saturday despite alleged falsified results. Melaye said: “The reports about me boycotting Saturday election is just the imagination of APC. We never said we are boycotting the election. “PDP only rejected the results of the past election. The PDP is the people’s party and will never shy away from political participation though we know they are not credible and fair. “PDP respects the constitutionalism of democracy and will never boycott election even though figures from Kabba local government area are wrong. “I will not boycott Saturday’s election.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
