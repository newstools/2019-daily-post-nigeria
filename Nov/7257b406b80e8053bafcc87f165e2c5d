The Senate at its plenary on Thursday ordered its Committee on Water Resources to investigate the delay in the execution of Kagara dam in Niger State, despite the receipt of funding to the tune of N7.7 billion from the Federal Government. In a motion sponsored by Senator Musa Mohammed Sani representing Niger North Senatorial district alongside nineteen others, the upper chamber said, the contract has failed after non completion in seventeen years. The Kagara Water Dam, which is located in Niger State, was awarded to WRECA in 1999, but remain uncompleted due to alleged non release of funds. In her contribution, Senator Uche Ekwunife, called for termination of the contract, saying that the contractor lacked capacity to executive that contract. Senator Musa in the motion revealed that the FG took over the project in order to provide portable water and irrigation to Kagara and its environs, which was re-awarded to Biwater Shellaber (Nig.) Limited in December, 1992 at the cost of N199, 222,596. The lawmaker said the project suffered neglect because of lack of funding, which necessitated its renegotiation in the year 2001 at the cost of N2,219,746,244.75. He further disclosed that the Upper Niger River Basin Development Authority, which is the supervising agency, issued a revised estimated cost to complete the project in the year 2010 pegged at N5,555,416,689.78. “If this project continues to be operated in a ‘stop and go’ manner, the dream of our people for portable water and economic empowerment through irrigation farming will remain a mirage,” Senator Musa said.
