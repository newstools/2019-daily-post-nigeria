The APC also won Ogbia, former President Jonathan’s LGA with a wide margin, which was one of the strongholds of the PDP. APC polled 58,016 while the ruling PDP in the state got 13,763. Declaring the results, the Collation Officer, Prof Victor Igbenedion, declared that the APC won in the LGA after polling the highest number of votes. In Brass LGA where the current Minister of State for Petroleum hailed from, the APC also won with a total of 23,831, while PDP polled 10410.
