Reno Omokri, former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has berated Aisha Buhari, wife of President Muhanmadu Buhari for urging the people of Kogi State to forgive their governor, Yahaya Bello. Omokri said Aisha Buhari should forgive the family of her husband’s nephew, Mamman Daura, if she wants people of Kogi State to forgive Bello, who is owing salaries. Mrs Buhari had made the appeal on Thursday during the All Progressives Congress (APC) rally held in the state, ahead of the governorship election slated to hold on November 16, 2019. She assured the residents that salaries will be paid in the state following the President’s intervention. Aisha urged the citizens to forget Bello’s wrongdoings in the state, adding that they will not be disappointed if they vote for him. However, Omokri in a tweet on Friday wrote: “If @AishaMBuhari wants Kogi people to forgive Yahaya Bello, who has not paid them salary for years (not months), then she should also forgive Mamman Daura and his family and invite them back to Aso Rock. What is good for Kogi should be good for Aisha!” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
