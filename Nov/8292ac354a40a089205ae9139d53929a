Head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, singled out the duo of Ola Aina and Samuel Kalu for special praise, after their 2-1 victory over Benin Republic in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on Wednesday. Both players returned to the starting line-up, having missed the team’s last international friendly against Brazil. Aina won the penalty converted by Victor Osimhen to make it 1-1 and generally put in a good display. Kalu grabbed the winning goal in the 63rd minute, with a fine solo goal. “I am happy to see also that the two changes I made since the Brazil game, bringing in Ola Aina and Kalu, the two players did very well also. “It is good for the team to know that even other players can come, there’s competition for the starting positions and this is very good for us,” Rohr told the media.
