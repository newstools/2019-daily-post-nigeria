Real Madrid ace, Eden Hazard has hailed Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard for his impressive start in charge of the Blues so far this season. Lampard’s men are currently in the third position on the English Premier League, EPL, table with 26 points from 12 games. Hazard, who scored twice in Belgium’s 4-1 victory over Russia in a Euro 2020 qualifier over the weekend, believes Lampard can become one of the best managers in the world. Asked if he was surprised by Lampard’s impact at Chelsea, Hazard was quoted by Metro UK as telling reporters while on international duty with Belgium: “No, not at all. I know Frank as a player, not as a manager, but he’s a great guy. “He’s showed already after four months that he can be one of the best managers in the world. “The good thing is that they are playing with young players, young English players. For England it’s good, for Chelsea’s it’s good. They are lucky to have young players with quality.” Hazard added: “I still have good friends there. I follow them all the time. They are winning at the moment so I’m just happy for them.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
