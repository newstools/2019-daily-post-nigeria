Dr. Paul Enenche, Senior Pastor of Dunamis International Gospel, has dropped a new song/video to mark this year’s anniversary of the ministry. The song entitled Elee, is in appreciation to God for HIS faithfulness in the ministry. Speaking on the inspiration behind the song, Dr. Enenche said the song is an exclamation of Joy and enthusiastic appreciation to God for the wonders HE has so graciously done in the church. “In my vernacular, when someone screams “Elee!!” it means something surprisingly strange and wonderful has happened. “If you take a look at what God has done in this ministry so far, you will have no other choice than to shout “Elee!!” The song entitled Elee, is in appreciation to God for HIS faithfulness in the ministry.

Ele Ele oo
Ele Ele o Mighty God
No words can express the way
I feel for you Ele Ele oooo
Ele Ele ooo You are the only one
Ele Ele ooo
Ele Ele Oh Lord
You are marvelous (Ele Ele oo)
Wonderful beyond description
Wondrous beyond numbers Lord you are in the class
All by yourself
Lord there’s no God that
Compares to you
Lord I’m amazed at your almightiness
Lord you are to wonderful for comprehension
So my heart cries out Ele! Ele Ele oo
Ele Ele o You are the King of kings
The beginning and the end
The Lily of the valley
The Bright and Morning Star You have done so many marvelous things
With You nothing is impossible Lord
You live in the realm of signs and wonders
The supernatural is your habitat
So my heart cries out Ele Ele Ele oo
