In line with Governor Mai Mala Buni’s promise to ameliorate the effects of the Zangon Kanwa Market fire on victims, the North East Development Commission (NEDC) has conducted a rapid response assessment of the incident. The NEDC has also provided relief material food items such as rice, spaghetti, cooking oil, seasoning and tomatoes paste, among others to cushion the effect of the fire incident. Alhaji Mohammed Goni Alkali, MD/CEO of NEDC represented by the Executive Director Finance and Administration of the Commission, Alh. Mohammed Jawa Gashua, said the donation was to cushion the effect of the disaster on the victims. Dr. Ali Ibrahim Abbas, State Focal Person/Coordinator, NEDC Yobe State said the team assessed the damage caused by the Inferno and the number of people affected with a view to making recommendations to the Government regarding relief, recovery and reconstruction. “This important assessment process equally allowed NEDC to understand the greatest needs of the shop owners and recommend the most effective and sustainable strategies for further recovery mobilization. “The Commission has also pledged to work with Yobe State Government to contribute in rebuilding and modernising the burnt market”, Abbas noted Recall that DAILY POST had reported that, about 20 shops stockpiled with potash were burnt to ashes in Gashua town following an early morning fire disaster.
