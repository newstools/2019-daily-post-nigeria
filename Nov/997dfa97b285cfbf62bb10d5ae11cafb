Head coach of Benin Republic, Michel Dussuyer, has issued warning to the Super Eagles of Nigeria ahead of their clash in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier in Uyo on Wednesday evening. Dussuyer said that the Squirrels are going to play a game with ambitions against Gernot Rohr’s men, adding that they will defend their chances on the pitch. “We know Nigeria is a great African and World champion, third in the last CAN. They have a large squad with players who play at the highest level,” Dussuyer told Beninwebtv. “We know the gaps in potential. We are here to defend our chances on the field if we are disciplined. We already have some experience of playing for the big teams. We’re going to play a game with ambitions.” Dussuyer added: “I know that in front of Nigeria, we have a lot of absentees. I will try to build the best team possible with the players at the moment. We had little time to work but I am glad we had friendlies before. “There will be a player who will be less experienced in the central defence. On the right too, there will be Youssouf Assogba who is a young man. “We must be even more focused. It’s the whole team that has to make the effort.” The kick-off time for the match is 5pm.
