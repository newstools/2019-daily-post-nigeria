Senate President, Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan has condemned noise making by his colleague Senators during Tuesday’s plenary, saying lawmakers should desist from such. Lawan, in support of a point of order raised by Sen George Sekibo (Rivers East) upheld that the chamber was noisy and uncomfortable for lawmaking. “The chamber is noisy,” Lawan said while urging the senators to maintain decorum at the ongoing plenary.

The Senate President, having stopped the noisemaking, Senators proceeded with other legislative businesses.
