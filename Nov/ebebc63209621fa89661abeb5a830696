The presiding Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ Gospel Church, Adewale Giwa has prayed for peace ahead of the November 16 governorship election in Kogi State. In a statement he personally signed and made available to DAILY POST on Wednesday, Giwa urged security personnel to protect the people of Kogi from desperate politicians who want to hijack the state by force. He said,” It is unfortunate some desperate politicians already have results before the election again. You don’t need to force yourself to rule on the people when they no longer want you. “They don’t care to see the writing on the wall because they have the winning slot machine. I pray that God should take absolute control and expose those who plan to shed the blood of innocent people of Kogi before the election in Jesus Name. “If you are a good material, you do not need to force yourself on the people. I want to beg the security men to hold on to their promises to protect the innocent people of Kogi. “I am also begging the contestants to play the game according to the rules and ensure peace and unity during and after the election. They should also remember that there is nothing permanent in this world except death; You can only change situations as long as you are alive.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
