The appellate court, however, declared Effiong Johnson of the All Progressives Congress (APC) winner and ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission lNEC to issue Certificate of Return to the APC candidate. However, PDP in the state in reaction to the ruling, said the party would accept the verdict in good faith. The PDP State Publicity Secretary, Barr.
