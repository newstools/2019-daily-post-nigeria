Manchester City star, Riyad Mahrez, has revealed that Leicester City stopped him from joining Arsenal in 2016 during his time with the Foxes.

Speaking with France Football, Mahrez said: “After the title, if I’d left for a top team, it wouldn’t have been the same story. “For me, it’s clear that I lost two years at the highest level. I lost two years! Because instead of arriving at City at 27, I could have been there at 24, 25. “Leicester blocked me. They told me: ‘You’re not leaving, you’re not leaving’. “My agent had spoken to [Arsene] Wenger who really wanted me. It was nearly all done with Arsenal in 2016. I was really frustrated. “It wasn’t easy to go from being the best player in the Premier League to being a part of a team fighting against relegation. “It’s not the same job.
