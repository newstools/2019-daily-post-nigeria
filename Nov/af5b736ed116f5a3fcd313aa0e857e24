The National President of the National Council of Women Societies (NCWS), Dr. Gloria Shoda, has condemned the recent attack on the Social Democratic Party (SDP) governorship flagbearer, Barrister Natasha Akpoti in Lokoja, Kogi State. In a statement released to the press, a copy of which was made available to DAILY POST in Abuja on Thursday, the NCWS President faulted the repeated attacks on Natasha Akpoti, saying that, “it scares women away from politics when we should be encouraging more women into participating in politics.” She bemoaned the inaction of security agencies present at the venue of the Peace Pact Ceremony where Natasha was attacked. Their duty was to ensure the safety of everybody present at the ceremony. Dr Shoda noted that violence against women in election seasons is no longer acceptable and all Nigerians should condemn the acts being perpetrated against women who want to participate in elections. Adding that violence was one of the elements which discourages women from contributing their political quota to the growth of the country. She reiterated that the council frowns on violence against opponents and called for a peaceful conduct of elections in Kogi State.
