Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has confirmed that Granit Xhaka, will not play against Leicester City this Saturday. Emery, addressing the media on Friday, revealed that Xhaka told him he does not feel he can feature in the Premier League game. “Not yet,” Emery replied when asked if Xhaka was ready to return. “I spoke with him on Tuesday for how he is feeling now and his mind because he is training well, but he said to me he can’t play. We are going to wait.” Xhaka has not played since his furious outburst at the Emirates and is reportedly keen to leave the club in Arsenal. The Swiss international has already been replaced as captain by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.
