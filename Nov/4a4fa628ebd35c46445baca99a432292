I seek for his royal blessings and support to enable the command succeed with its plans and strategy in providing adequate security in and around the state. “We have measures already put in place to provide watertight security in the state and in particular Umueri axis being an agricultural region and also seek robust partnership with the traditional institutions because of your closeness to the people. “I promised to help in the areas of farmers, herders clash by deploying the recently trained Agro Rangers squad to the community as the Christmas season is fast approaching,” he said. Responding, Igwe Emeka welcomed the commandant to Umueri and promised to assist the Command in its efforts to maintain peace in the state.
