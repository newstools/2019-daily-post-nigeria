Former heavyweight champion, Mike Tyson, has said Anthony Joshua should not be worried about his rematch against Andy Ruiz Jr, SportingLife reports. Joshua has the chance to reclaim the heavyweight world titles he lost to Ruiz on December 7 in Saudi Arabia. The pair of fighters have lost weight ahead of their crunch heavyweight clash and Tyson has weighed in on the world title contest, analysing both of their chances. “Obviously he knows what happened, because I’m sure he’s watched the films. “Because if he’s intelligent like I believe he is, he watched the films over and over of the last encounter he had with Ruiz. And he’s worried, but he should be confident that he can be successful.” Tyson also spoke about Ruiz Jr’s weight loss. The Mexican-American appears to be lighter and the 53-year-old boxing legend believes it doesn’t make sense. “I just don’t think that makes any sense. “But everybody has their own thing, their vanity gets the best of them, they say ‘Hey, I wanna look good doing this stuff’, I don’t know. But I’m a believer that if it’s not broken, don’t fix it. The only thing Ruiz has to do is do what he did last fight. That’s all he has to live off of, from his memories, so to speak, from the last fight,” Tyson added. When asked to make a prediction, Tyson chose to sit on the fence. “I don’t know because anything is possible,” he said. “They’re both great human beings, I like both of them personally, but this is a fight and I just hope the best man wins.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
