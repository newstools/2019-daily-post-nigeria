The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has reacted to reports making the rounds that its governorship candidate in Kogi State, Musa Wada has conceded defeat to Yahaya Bello. DAILY POST reports that INEC on Sunday night suspended collation of results in Kogi State. The commission is expected to resume collation of results on Monday at 9am. The results of only Ibaji and Lokoja local government areas are outstanding with Governor Yahaya Bello in clear lead in 11 local governments. PDP in a post on its official Twitter page on Monday morning urged Nigerians and PDP supporters to discard reports that Wada has conceded defeat to Bello. The opposition party blamed the APC for spreading fake news in Kogi State. The post read: “Please, ignore the news making the rounds that our Gubernatorial Candidate, Musa Wada has conceded defeat and congratulated Yahaya Bello. “This is not true. It’s the handiwork of the failed APC supporters in Kogi State.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
