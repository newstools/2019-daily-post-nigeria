The National Examinations Council (NECO) has dismissed no fewer than 70 staff for alleged certificate forgery. The approval for the sack of the affected staff was made at NECO’s 17th extra-ordinary meeting of the Governing Board after vetting a report by a verification committee set up by the management. The decision was part of a statement signed by the Head of Information and Public Relations Division, Azeez Sani in Minna. The exam body said that the dismissal of the staff was as a result of a report submitted by a committee constituted to verify the certificates of staff by the management of NECO. “The certificate Verification Committee carried out its assignment diligently by inviting all staff with questionable credentials to appear before it, during which some staff actually attested that their certificates were fake,” the statement said. “The Committee also contacted the Schools and Institutions the affected staff claimed to have attended and the Schools and Institutions denied having certificated them.” It added that the sack is the first phase in the series of the on-going staff certificate verification exercise in the Council.
