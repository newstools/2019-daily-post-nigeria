The Court of Appeal sitting in Ado Ekiti on Wednesday declared the Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) candidate, Senator Biodun Olujimi, winner of the Ekiti South Senatorial District’s poll. The court moved to Kaduna State on Wednesday to deliver the judgment in the case filed by the senator representing Ekiti South Senatorial District, Prince Dayo Adeyeye. In the earlier ruling on the matter, the tribunal had declared Olujimi winner with total votes of 54,894 against Adeyeye, who garnered 52,234 after the Justice Danladi A deck-led tribunal nullified the elections in some units. Reacting to her victory, Senator Olujimi tweeted, “Congratulations to my steadfast constituents of Ekiti South Senatorial District and all Ekiti people indeed. “It is a Victory For Democracy and the Freedom of Choice. “May God only be Praised, to Him alone be all the glory. “ Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
