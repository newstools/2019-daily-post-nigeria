British former Prime Minister Tony Blair, on Monday, said that Britain was in a dangerous mess. He declared that neither his own Labour Party nor Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservatives deserved to win a Dec. 12 election. Britain is holding an election three years ahead of schedule because parliament was deadlocked over Brexit, unable to agree on how or even whether to leave the EU. “We’re in a mess,’’ Blair said at a Reuters Newsmaker event. “The buoyancy of the world economy has kept us going up to now, but should that falter, we will be in deep trouble.’’ Blair, Labour prime minister from 1997 to 2007, said both major parties were peddling fantasies, adding that if the opinion polls were accurate, Johnson’s party looked likely to win a majority. Blair, the only Labour leader to win three elections, said his party was now controlled by its “Marxist-Leninist wing” and that its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was promising a revolution. “The problem with revolutions is never how they begin but how they end.The problem with revolutions is that they always end badly,’’ said Blair. “The truth is: the public isn’t convinced either main party deserves to win this election outright.’’ Blair, an opponent of Brexit, argued for a second referendum on the decision to leave, saying it would need to be followed by another general election. Blair said he did not know whether Labour would ever return to the centre-ground of British politics. “We must set about the urgent task of reconstructing the sensible mainstream of British politics,” he added. “Otherwise, this laboratory experiment in populism running riot will end very badly for our nation.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
