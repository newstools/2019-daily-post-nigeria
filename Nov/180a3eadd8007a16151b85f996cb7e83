Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard has insisted that he has no bad feelings towards the Blues fans, who left Stamford Bridge when their side were losing 4-1 to Ajax in the Champions League, before their superb comeback on Tuesday night. Chelsea were three goals down in the Champions League tie, before the Dutch side saw two of their two central defenders, Daley Blind and Joel Veltman sent off. It swung the match in Chelsea’s favour, with a second penalty of the match from Jorginho and goals from Cesar Azpilicueta and Reece James bringing the hosts to level at 4-4. Speaking to talkSPORT, Lampard, however, backs the club’s supporters who left early, saying they had to go to work. Asked about the supporters who left early, Lampard said: “One of them was probably my dad! “He’s forever shooting off early to miss traffic and then the game changes and we have to have a conversation later on. Listen, I get it with some people, especially on an evening when some people have to go to work. Lampard added: “But the ones who stayed – I’ve spoken to my friends at the game and some of the fans – they thought it was a special evening. I was just a bit disappointed we didn’t get the extra goal. We had the one chalked off, but even after that, I thought we were going to push and get it. We were unlucky in the end not to win the game.” Lampard’s men will now take on Crystal Palace this weekend in the Premier League in their next fixture.
