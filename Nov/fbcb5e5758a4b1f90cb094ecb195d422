The Edo Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Thursday rejected the suspension of the state chairman of the party, Mr Anselm Ojezua by the party’s National Working Committee. DAILY POST recalls that the National Working Committee (NWC) of the APC on Wednesday approved the suspension of the Edo State chairman of the party, Anselm Ojezua. It also approved the suspension of eleven of the sixteen members of the Edo State Working Committee (SWC). Ojezua and those affected are said to be loyalists of Governor Godwin Obaseki. Reacting, a statement issued by the State Assistant Secretary of the party, Mr Anthony Ikhuenobe, described the decision of the NWC as ‘biased considering the speed at which it accepted the unconstitutional attempt by some members of the state working committee to remove the state chairman of the party. “They were sponsored and supervised by the National Chairman of APC without recourse to the state Executive Committee. “In any case, the state executive committee of the party in Edo State had met on Nov. 12 and passed a vote of implicit confidence on the Chairman, Anselm Ojezua,” NAN quoted him as saying. Ikhuenobe also accused APC national leadership of being the sponsor of the Edo Peoples Movement (EPM), a splinter group in the APC in Edo. He stated that the group was created to destabilise the party in the state and called on Nigerians to disregard the purported suspension of the state chairman of APC.
