Real Madrid ace, Eden Hazard has insisted that he isn’t feeling the pressure of replacing or scoring more goals than the club legend, Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo left Real Madrid as their all-time highest goalscorer to join the Serie A champions, Juventus in the summer of 2018. Hazard is yet to hit top form for Zinedine Zidane’s men since he joined the Los Blancos from Chelsea last summer. The Belgium international has scored once in eight La Liga appearances for Real Madrid so far this season. “When I take to the pitch, I do not think about Cristiano having been there before me, nor that I must do better than him,” Hazard told Le Parisien. “Other people will make comparisons. “I will not score more goals than Cristiano, that is for sure.” Hazard added: “A Galactico is a player who scores goals and wins for his team. I was probably one with Chelsea. Here, for now, I am like a young guy who comes with the ambition of trying to win his role. I must be consistent first, scoring goals and winning titles.” “I have always been somebody who relaxes during the summer. I knew that I would be criticised more with Real than with Chelsea, but that is not a problem.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.
